This Fanfic_22 Authorship attribution (AA) dataset is a custom-prepared dataset derived from the author verification dataset of following works:

Saedi, C., Dras, M. Siamese networks for large-scale author identification, Computer Speech & Language, vol. 70, pp. 1-15, 2021, DOI: 10.1016/j.csl.2021.101241.

Fernandes, N., Dras, M., McIver, A. Generalised Differential Privacy for Text Document Processing. Principles of Security and Trust (POST), April 2019, pp. 123â€“148. DOI: 10.1007/978-3-030-17138-4_6.

B. Lavanya, R. Sowmiya. Distilled and fused style embedding for authorship attribution with weighted multi-kernel ensemble model. International Journal on Information Technologies and Security, vol.16, no.4, 2024, pp. 25-36. DOI: https://doi.org/10.59035/XDXI5594

This is a smaller dataset with 22 authors each having 20 instances of fanfiction excerpts. 

The text is extracted in such a random way that it can start from the middle of a longer fiction.

9% of the authors are multi-topic authors meaning that they have written for different fanbases.

We hope that this dataset helps to contribute to the existing knowledge base of AA research.
