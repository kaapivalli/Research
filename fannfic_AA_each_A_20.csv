This would prove to be interesting. /break\ ""He's adorable"", whispered Juniper with a small smile as she prepared the room. She was peeking through the half-open bathroom door while making the bed together with Piper. In the bathroom were Will, Nico and Trend. While Nico tried to scrub the little pup, Will tried to do a check-up. Take the pup's temperature, measure his height and weight. Trend wasn't cooperative. ""He's deeply scarred"", pointed Silena out, frowning concerned. ""He already lost everything – his parents, his pack, his home. It'll take a lot of time before he's alright again..."" ""That's why I called you"", countered Percy amused. ""You're part of his pack too now. Pack helps."" ""For a vampire, you have a very good feeling for pack too"", stated Charles, raising one eyebrow. While Juniper and Piper were making the bed, Percy, Charles and Silena were cleaning up some. The guest rooms were rarely being used and if so, they had enough time to prepare them beforehand. It was still far from a proper bedroom for a child, but for not, it at the very least had a bed, a bath and a roof over his head. Percy was a little concerned that the child may not like the presence of a vampire close by, which was why he had chosen to help cleaning up – so his scent would be all over the room too. By association, he may grow used to Percy then. ""Look at the pretty cub that was hidden beneath the dirt"", announced Nico proudly. He was carrying Trend back to the bedroom, holding him up by the armpits. The little boy squirmed and tried to escape. Nico carried him to the bed and sat him down there, starting to tickle his belly until the boy was finally forced to laugh a little and bare his tiny fangs to the Alpha. Percy smiled fondly as he sat down on the bed and watched his mate and the pup play. ""I want you to meet some people, Trend"", stated Nico once both were calmed down again and Trend was curled up in Nico's lap. ""This is Percy, he's my mate, which makes him your Alpha too."" ""But he's a dead thing"", frowned Trend, trying to hide in Nico's embrace. ""A vampire"", corrected Nico fondly. ""Your parents were on the way over here because we wolves and the vampires live in peace. That's because me and Percy are mates. So you can't call them 'dead things' anymore. They're vampires. And I promise that the only vampires you'll meet here will be nice. Like Percy. Percy is very nice and he can be very silly, I'm sure you'll have fun with him."" To prove Nico's point, Percy started making silly faces until the boy was giggling again. Nico smiled gratefully at his mate. Will, Charles, Silena, Juniper and Piper formed a half-circle around them, all offering the little boy smiles and trying to look as non-threatening as possible. ""Those are Juniper and Piper, they work here. If there's anything you want or need, you can always ask them. Like, when you're hungry"", continued Nico, nudging Trend's head with his own. ""And those three are our pack-mates. Will, Charles and Silena. Guys, this is Trend."" ""Hello, little puppy"", cooed Silena and reached out to pat his blonde curls. ""I'm not little"", objected Trend and wiggled his nose. ""I'm already seven a half!"" ""My, such a big boy"", grinned Piper. ""Uhu!"", agreed Trend, nodding wildly and looking around. ""And... I can really stay here?"" ""You're part of my pack now and I, as your Alpha, am responsible for you"", nodded Nico, grip on the pup tightening. ""I'll protect you. Me and Percy, we're your Alphas from now on. We'll... never be able to replace your parents and we're not going to try, but from now on, we will try our best to do what they did for you. Protect you, feed you, care for you."" Percy quirked his lips in amusement. So he had just adopted a kid without a prior word, huh? It was a good thing he had such a big heart then, because there was no way he'd put the little pup out into the rain again. Scooting closer, he slowly lifted a hand and caressed Trend's curls. The little wolf turned skeptical gray eyes on Percy, observing every little movement. Percy smiled. ""I think we should leave them alone for a while"", suggested Will, pushing the others out. One of the qualities about Will that Nico appreciated. The blonde was good at bossing others around and getting what he wanted. Now that it was just the three of them, Nico adjusted the pup to lay between Percy and Nico, facing his new Alpha. Percy wrapped his arms around the little child from behind and Nico laid his arms around both of them. ""It's alright, Trend"", whispered Nico softly. ""You're safe now."" It was all Trend needed to break down. The little boy started to sob, crying over the loss of his parents, the time he had spend isolated in that cell, having left his home forever. This was why Nico appreciated that Will had given them some privacy. Trend was a tough boy, but he was still only a boy. He needed to cry this out, in the safety of his new Alphas. Nico's eyes searched for Percy's, locking with the sea-green, soft eyes of his mate. Percy had his nose buried in Trend's blonde curls, looking tenderly at Nico. Nico smiled a little as he saw the acceptance in them. Author's note: The story will have three chapters. Just a tiny short sequel to round things up. Next chapter will unravel the mystery about the attack - who did it and why. And now with Trend around, Percy will start questioning if maybe he should start looking for an heir too; someone he could sire."

He knew Percy liked a bit rougher preparation – he had asked Nico to entirely skip it a couple of times already, something Nico adamantly refused to do. But he did usually just use two fingers right away, knowing how much Percy liked the burn. The vibrator easily slipped in and Nico started moving it around, wiggling it until he found Percy's prostate – that find was easily confirmed by Percy's uncontrolled moans. After a little while, Percy started bucking up, rubbing his dick against Nico's sixpack. Nico smirked at the frustrated little whimper coming from Percy. ""L—Lemme come, Nico"", pleaded Percy, turning his normally very effective puppy-eyes on Nico. ""Not yet, babydoll"", whispered Nico darkly, tugging on Percy's earlobe. ""You're gonna be a good boy and wait until I'm inside you, until I'm filling you up with my cum."" That had been their first step into naughtier than vanilla territory. A month ago, they had talked about doing it bareback. They had gone to the doctors, made sure they were really clean. Turned out Percy really liked being filled with cum. He whimpered at the words, nodding wildly. ""Good boy"", whispered Nico, feeling as though those were the right words here – and judging by the way Percy went boneless beneath him, they actually were. ""You like that?"" ""The being filled thing? Duh. We've talked about this weeks ago"", huffed Percy embarrassed. ""The 'good boy' part"", corrected Nico, raising one eyebrow. ""You like when I call you that?"" After a beat, Percy nodded reluctantly, face red. ""I... I like the... uh, validation? Feeling like I did something right. Like... I'm appreciated? Scars from the past and all that stuff."" Nico nodded sharply, not wishing to go into detail about a) abusive stepfather, b) manipulative gods and c) two wars. He knew exactly where Percy's need for appreciation rooted from and he cursed himself for not having figured that out sooner. Leaning down again, Nico started peppering Percy's face and neck with soft kisses while slowly moving the vibrator inside his lover. ""You're very much appreciated, Perce"", whispered Nico. ""My precious, precious Sea Prince. You're so good for me, letting me do this to you. Trusting me like that. My good boy."" He kept whispering sweet praises until Percy seemed to melt beneath him. Only then did he pull out the vibrator, which earned him the cutest little whimper and pout from Percy. Grinning amused, Nico tried to kiss the pout away while lubing up his cock. ""C'mon, no pouting, Perce. You get something way better"", promised Nico. ""That sounds good"", hummed Percy in appreciation, tugging on the handcuffs because he wanted to lay his arms around Nico's neck. ""Aw. Untie me so I can touch you, Nick?"" ""Nope. Tonight, you're all mine. All the touching is my privilege. You're my present for my first Independence Day, aren't you? Kinda ironic how un-independent you are being right now"", smirked Nico as he grasped Percy's thighs. ""Tonight, you're mine to touch."" Percy mewled at that, closing his eyes in bliss. ""Then at least do more of the touching!"" Percy wiggled around under the vibrating eggs, nipples slowly growing too sensitive and a little sore. Then again, Percy actually liked that. He loved when Nico left him sore one place or another, as a reminder of their love-making. A drawn-out moan slipped from his lips as Nico finally pushed in. The thick, warm hardness spread him more and more as it entered him deeper and deeper. Nico kissed him deeply, swallowing all his moans, as he waited for Percy to adjust. Once he felt as though Percy was well-adjusted, Nico started thrusting in sharp angles. Percy moaned and whimpered every time Nico hit his prostate and after a while, he couldn't endure it anymore. ""P—Please, Nico! I really need to come! Please, please, please"", begged Percy desperately. ""Tell me why I should let you come"", demanded Nico teasingly, hands on Percy's cock. ""B—Because I'm your good boy? I was good, right? So reward me, please?"", requested Percy. Nico looked thoughtful for another moment before slipping the cockring off and smiling at Percy. ""Yes, you are. You're my good boy. You were very good tonight, so you do deserve a reward."" Percy sighed relieved as Nico started pumping his cock in the rhythm of his thrusts. Within seconds did he come hard all over both their bodies. He collapsed back in his bonds, breathless and boneless. Nico's thrusts grew harder and deeper as he enjoyed the way Percy tightened up around him. Only a couple thrusts later did Nico follow his lover and filled Percy up with his come. The warm sensation made Percy hum contently. While riding out his orgasm, Nico marveled at how beautiful Percy looked beneath him like that. Percy was positively debauched and it was gorgeous. Huffing pleased, Nico slowly pulled out of Percy, but not without grabbing the butt-plug – he had quite the hunch how that particular item had found its way into Percy's shopping bag, seeing as Percy liked being full. The content humming grew louder as Nico plugged him. Nico started peppering Percy's torso and face with kisses while slowly pulling the duct-tape and eggs off before turning them off. After putting them aside, Nico cautiously unlocked the cuffs and gathered Percy in his arms, hugging him tightly and kissing his forehead and cheeks softly. ""Happy Independence Day"", whispered Percy as he snuggled up to Nico. ""You liked it?"" ""Which part?"", snorted Nico amused. ""The great food, the fun evening, the beautiful fireworks or the mind blowing sex with my amazing boyfriend who trusts me so much and amazes me even more? Because I gotta say, if all Independence Days are like that... It's my new favorite holiday."" Percy laughed at that, obviously pleased as he adjusted to rest his cheek on Nico's chest. Nico was right though, the evening really had been perfect all around. ~*~ The End ~*~"

While Percy got comfortable on the couch, Nico went and poured himself, Will and Jake a glass of cognac. Percy looked content nursing his hot chocolate. ""Well then, to Lizzy Mason"", toasted Nico, lifting his glass up. ""To Lizzy Mason"", agreed the other three with smiles. ""So, why Lizzy? I thought you also saw a boy?"", inquired Percy curiously. ""I couldn't..."", started Will and shook his head. ""I guess me and Leroy just didn't hit it off. The boy was... we didn't have a connection. Somehow, he... made me feel uneasy..."" Honestly, at first I brushed it off, thought it was because, well, we tinkerers are pretty bad with people, but... I gotta agree. Something about that boy is just... off"", agreed Jake with a frown. ""Lizzy though, I wanted to keep that girl from the moment I saw her."" ""That's good"", said Percy with a caring smile. ""It is"", grinned Will with a nod. ""I mean, she's adorable. Oh, and we adopted four ducks."" ""Not sure if the girl is a good match. Will is bringing home enough strays as it is"", teased Nico with a smirk. ""You can just open up an animal shelter right now, Jake."" ""I think that's a sweet trade"", chided Percy with a glare. ""Taking care of the weak and wounded."" ""Says the boy who adopted a pegasus, a hellhound and a skeleton kitten"", muttered Nico. ""Said the man who just nodded and smiled and did everything his husband wanted"", chimed Will. Nico huffed and stuck his tongue out at his blonde friend, causing the son of Apollo to grin broadly. Percy snorted and rolled his eyes before sipping his chocolate again. He was glad for their friends, that they had found a child that seemed to fit so perfectly into their family. All of them had suffered so much during the wars, during their lives before New Athens. All that darkness that kept haunting them in one way or the other, they deserved a little sunshine to brighten their days and in Percy's experience, no light shone brighter than that of a child. A child that loved them unconditionally and needed them to protect and love them just as much. Will and Jake deserved to experience the kind of happiness that family had given Percy. Smiling, he laid one hand on his stomach, soon to be joined by Nico's. The Italian smiled at him so incredibly lovingly as he leaned in to kiss Percy. ""I love you"", whispered Nico against Percy's lips. /break\ Lizzy was bouncing on the balls of her feet, her backpack sitting at her feet as she waited nervously. Mister Jason stood behind her, also waiting. Mister Jason had come to her this morning and told her to pack her things, because she would get to live with Will and Jake because they had decided to keep her. Which meant she would get her own family and her own home. ""If you're not happy or if you have problems, you can always come to me"", said Jason honestly. ""Okay, Mister Jason. Thank you"", nodded Lizzy obediently. ""There she is! Look, Will!"", exclaimed Jake in excitement as soon as they rounded the corner. ""Yes, love. I can see her too"", chuckled Will fondly, shaking his head. Lizzy chewed on her lip as the two approached her, unsure what to do or say. But that was taken from her when Jake reached her, because he just picked her up and whirled her around until she was giggling happily. Jake grinned at her as he handed her over to Will so he could take her things. ""Hello, ducky"", smiled Will, giving her an Eskimo kiss while adjusting to hold her more securely. ""You ready to come home with dad and me? Daisy and the ducklings already miss you."" ""...Dad?"", asked Lizzy shyly, looking at Jake. ""Yes, ducky?"", asked Jake, lifting his head to return her look. ""Don't you wanna come with daddy and me? Because we're really looking forward to having you with us."" ""I... can?"", asked Lizzy, searching for Jason's eyes for confirmation. ""You can"", confirmed Jason and ruffled her hair. ""If you want. Do you want to?"" Her eyes sparkled in a way that rivaled the sun as she nodded her head so wild that it looked as though it would fall off. Will laughed, tightening his grip on her and looking at his husband. ""Well then, let's bring you home so you can play with the ducklings"", declared Jake. ""And Daisy can really stay until she's all good?"", asked Lizzy worried. ""Of course, my little ducky"", smiled Will, rocking her back and forth. ""We're children of Apollo, after all. We tend to those who need our help and make them better."" Jake's eyes softened as he watched Will and Lizzy. It was what he had always loved most about his Will. Children of Apollo came in three different versions – the musicians, the archers and the healers. Will was rubbish with a bow, he was relatively talented with a guitar but had never been a true musical protegee. But he was a healer at heart. He was the right person to raise Lizzy. ""You know, daddy here always brought home strays too"", mused Jake while they made their way back home. ""Hurt puppies or kittens. One time even a son of Hades."" ""Though dad didn't let me keep that one"", grinned Will. ""We gave him to a friend of ours, who has been taking good care of him though. The nice man we met yesterday, he's the son of Hades."" ""Oh. The daddy of Thess"", whispered Lizzy and perked up. ""Can Thess come over again?"" ""Of course he can, ducky. He's really looking forward to playing with you again"", answered Will. Jake grinned as they reached the house and he unlocked the door. ""Home, sweet home, ducky."" ~*~ The End ~*~"
3,3,71,3-Takara-Phoenix-71.txt,percy-jackson-and-the-olympians,TakaraPhoenix,"grinning at the beautiful smile on Percy's lips. ""Yeah. We could... I don't know, well, who knows, maybe our parents will have demigod children by then again and we may end up adopting them? Or a mischievous little kid of Hermes or something?"" There was an odd frown on Percy's face as he shook his head. ""Oh. Uhm, I thought... own kids...?"" Nico mirrored Percy's frown. ""Well, like I said, we could talk about it way in the future, when it actually comes to it. Though to be honest I'm not the biggest fan of surrogates. We'd have some kids being yours and some being mine, but... I think I'd prefer to just adopt a kids that's... neither of ours, because I kind of fear there'd be favoritism. Not sure in which direction, like if I'd try to coddle up more to your biological children, trying to make up for the lack of DNA link, or..."" ""No, I mean, own kids, yours and mine"", interrupted Percy and blinked slowly. ""It's why I insisted that whenever we have sex, we will use condoms. So I don't end up as a teen mom."" It took Nico a moment to process this information. ""Wait... You... c—can get... p—pregnant?"" ""Uhu"", nodded Percy, adapting a frown again. ""It's a thing. I mean, a power of mine. I dunno, I kinda expected this to be a thing you'd know, what with your early on obsession with Mythomagic and how you delved into mythology after you learned you're a demigod. Think about it, Aphrodite was born to the sea, simply because a torn-off dick was tossed into the ocean. That's all it took for the sea to give birth to the goddess of love. My dad once got impregnated by a male god too. The sea is fertile, life-bearing, and so are its children. It doesn't matter that I'm a guy."" Percy paused, studying Nico's face carefully. ""Are... Are you freaking out? Please don't freak out on me!"" ""N—Not freaking out. Just... taking in the information"", grunted Nico slowly. ""That's... uhm... Okay. That's amazing. I never... never thought about having own children, not since I realized I'm gay. This is... really very incredibly amazing. I think I may love you even more right now."" Percy blushed and ducked his head embarrassed, blushing a bit before grinning softly. ""Well, what kind of queen would I be if I couldn't offer my king any heirs, mh?"" Nico laughed heartedly and kissed Percy deeply, conveying all the love he felt. /omake\ Nico groaned and popped his neck as he returned from school. High school was hell, but he managed, because he knew Percy was waiting for him at their villa. When Nico unlocked the door and entered, he didn't even get the chance to call out for his lover, because Percy already stood there, looking very guilty and shifting nervously. He was wearing the school girl uniform with the too short skirt and Nico's eyes instantly darkened as he saw that. He loved that outfit and he knew exactly what it meant that Percy was waiting for him in this specific costume. ""Hello, sir"", mumbled Percy and bit his lips shyly. ""I—I... I know I failed the test, but can I do anything to make my grades go up, Mister di Angelo? Anything at all ?"" Percy knew how much Nico hated that teacher he had today and he knew how hard this week had been on Nico and he knew how much Nico loved it when Percy dressed up. Nico's eyes softened as he kissed Percy deeply. He appreciated how his lover was trying to lighten his mood. ""Well, a naughty girl like you who doesn't learn her lesson first of all needs to be taught a lesson"", grunted Nico with a stern frown. ""Go to my office, bend over the desk and stick your ass out. Wait like that for me until I come for you. Don't move. Am I understood?"" Percy grinned brightly and skipped down the hall. Nico rolled his eyes and got rid of his tie. It was to cheer Nico up, but in the end Percy enjoyed his spankings probably more than Nico did. Nico took his sweet time to approach his waiting lover. At the desk, Nico grasped the wooden ruler there and ran it slowly up Percy's thighs, making him shudder. Without further delay, Nico started to let the ruler come down hard on Percy's ass and thighs, barely pausing between the hits. He knew Percy loved his spankings like that the most. Percy was a whimpering and sobbing mess by the time the beautiful firm ass was dark red. Nico loved listening to the cute little sounds and to the echo of the slaps, he loved watching how the pale skin turned a dark ruby red, one shade at a time. ""Okay. That's enough for today"", declared Nico, cautiously rubbing the tears off Percy's cheeks. Nico's office was normally off-limits for Percy, since it was for Nico to concentrate on work. They did have a special play-room to make things easier for Percy now that they were living together. But some session, especially themed ones, they'd move to a different room. They had agreed on that. Gathering Percy up in his arms, Nico carried him over to the couch in the corner, placing Percy on his lap and resting his hands on top of the nicely heated flesh, squeezing a little. Percy whimpered and buried his face in Nico's neck. Nico suspected that he wasn't the only one who has had a hard day. When Percy initiated a session involving a spanking, it was normally about Percy wanting to drown out something or seeking punishment for something he thought he had done wrong. Nico found himself incredibly grateful to be in the position of stabilizing Percy and helping him through life. Smiling tenderly, Nico placed a soft kiss on top of Percy's head. This was true happiness. ~*~ The End ~*~"
4,3,94,3-Takara-Phoenix-94.txt,percy-jackson-and-the-olympians,TakaraPhoenix,"afterward, because Percy just felt too amazing and the picture of a debauched Percy beneath him was the straw to break the camel's back. Growling deeply, he came inside of his lover. ""God, that... you... just..."", groaned Percy exhausted, spread out all over the bed. ""Yes, indeed"", agreed Nico amused and kissed Percy's nose. ""Now let's get you cleaned up."" ""...Moving...?"", asked Percy with a slight whine to his voice. ""No, you just look gorgeous"", chuckled Nico and lifted Percy up bridal style. He carried Percy over into the master bathroom and cautiously placed Percy in the large bathtub. Then he applied rose petals and some oils and turned on the hot water before climbing in behind Percy. Grabbing a large sponge, Nico started to rub soothing circles on Percy's back. Percy groaned happily as he got the special, tender treatment from his boyfriend. ""You're such a good boy"", praised Nico and kissed along Percy's neck. ""Well, actually you're not and I really want to spank you again for that stunt you pulled today. But seeing as that is contra-productive to your current state, we will delay this until you feel better tomorrow."" ""Yes, sir"", mumbled Percy embarrassed, hiding his face in his hands. ""I'm sorry. I know better, normally. I swear. I'm just... I know I was dumb. I promise I'll never do it again."" ""Not sure if I can trust you on that"", frowned Nico as he started massaging shampoo into Percy's scalp. ""I want you to move in with me, that way I can keep watching over you."" ""I don't need a babysitter"", grunted Percy flushed and irritated. ""I told you, I normally know better."" ""It's not like that, amore"", assured Nico, kissing Percy's shoulder-blade. ""It's... you're... very special to me and I do want to make sure that you're taken care for and safe. But I also... This is a very large and very empty house, but whenever you're here, it's brighter and warmer. I love having you here and I'd love to have you here all the time. If that would be something you'd want."" He laid his arms around Percy's waist and pulled him flush against his chest so he could start soaping Percy up as both were laying comfortable. Percy loved this. If this was what Nico would do after they had sex, then damn, Percy wanted to have sex every day. The tender touch and soft words were incredibly soothing and he started to truly believe that what he had done early hadn't been right. He had just never been with such an intense dom before. It had all been more playful little games with some bondage and some spanking, not so many orders, so many specifics. This was more intense than anything he ever had and he was afraid he'd screw it up. ""I'd like that"", whispered Percy and closed his eyes blissfully. ""Living with you, being yours."" ""Not always"", frowned Nico, kissing Percy's temple. ""I don't want a 24/7 sub. I want for us to... balance our love life and our kink life out. I want you as my boyfriend, I want us to be romantic and tender, not just strict and about orders. You know that, right?"" ""I have no idea how you imagine this to go down, but sure"", nodded Percy with a frown. ""I'd like to keep things the way we had them. I'd give you some smaller orders throughout the day and when we're together, we're... lovers. Our playtime starts with the nicknames, maybe we could redecorate a special playroom to which we restrict our playtime, to make the... cut clearer"", replied Nico thoughtful, caressing Percy's stomach and tracing his sixpack absentmindedly. ""But we can figure those things out as they come along, amore mio. For now, I just want you with me."" ""Me too"", grinned Percy and rolled over onto his stomach, resting his cheek on Nico's chest. ""I love you too, you know"", murmured Nico, kissing the top of Percy's head. ""I know I call you my love quite often, but I never actually said it aloud. And seeing as you proved that you're bad at reading between the lines, I'll spell it out for you. I love you, with all of my heart, Perseus."" Percy grinned sheepishly, his cheeks set afire as he looked up at Nico from beneath his lashes. ""I know. I should have known. A lot of things, I guess. You're perfect, you know?"" ""Been told that before"", hummed Nico with a teasing smirk. ""It's good you're perfect too, because otherwise we'd be a terrible match now, wouldn't we?"" ""Absolutely"", agreed Percy with a broad grin, leaning up to peck Nico's lips. ""And you know that, now that you're living with me, you wouldn't have to work in the sex-shop anymore"", drawled Nico reluctantly after another while of enjoying the bubble-bath. ""You're overstepping"", warned Percy lightly, drawing hearts and triangles onto Nico's torso. ""I'm not a housewife and I never will be. I love how you spoil me and shower me with gifts and I'd love to live here with you, but I still want to earn my own money and be my own man."" ""That's part of what I love so much about you"", admitted Nico sheepishly, small smile on his lips as he kissed Percy's cheek. ""You're independent and strong. I'm sorry. I just thought... you work all those long hours beside college and sometimes, you're really exhausted in the evening..."" ""Mh..."", drawled Percy thoughtful. ""I could maybe cut my hours down a little, to get some more free time. That way I could cook you dinner for when you get home from work."" ""Didn't you just say you don't want to be a housewife?"", teased Nico amused. ""I don't!"", yelped Percy with a pout. ""But I wouldn't mind being a part-time-househusband."" ""That sounds brilliantly perfect"", chuckled Nico, sealing Percy's lips. Percy hummed in agreement as they deepened their kiss. This really was perfection. ~*~ The End ~*~"
5,3,106,3-Takara-Phoenix-106.txt,percy-jackson-and-the-olympians,TakaraPhoenix,"Idiot"", muttered Percy annoyed. ""And yes. Bed sounds nice about now. Carry me?"" Octavian snorted, but he obeyed. Godhood had, thankfully enough, given him godly strength, because there was no way he would have been able to carry the hero. The way things were, Octavian could easily lift Percy bridal-style and carry him back inside from their star-gazing-picnic-nest on the balcony. As soon as Percy was on the bed, he sneakily tugged Octavian's shirt off before lifting his own arms demandingly. There was a giant teasing grin on his lips, lasting for as long as it took Octavian to strip the son of Poseidon down. As soon as Percy was naked, the Sea King spread out on the bed, stretching lasciviously. Octavian's eyes darkened as he drank in the sight. ""Shall we get a head-start before Lucas returns, Perseus?"", inquired Octavian amused. ""That was the plan, Tavy"", grinned Percy and wiggled his eyebrows. Snorting, Octavian went to fetch the lube. Octavian smirked as he saw how Percy spread his legs in invitation. The son of Poseidon had grown onto him too fast and too hard. Luke was supposed to be his one and only. The only person for him to care about. And somehow, Luke had burdened him with all of those people. Ethan and Alabaster were... enjoyable company, so was Annabeth actually. Percy was endearing and lovely. Sedanur was worth worshiping. ""Well, darling, what is it you want tonight?"", inquired Octavian, sitting down next to Percy and running his fingers over Percy's thighs. ""You've had a very hard day today, didn't you? Want me and Lucas to take proper care of you? Just tell me what we can do for you tonight."" Percy smiled pleased by that. His day had been long, he had spent most of it negotiating treaties in the underwater palace, trying to end a gang war between dolphins and beluga whales. Because that was his life now. It sounded amusing, but it had been hard and exhausting and long-lasting. Spreading his legs some more, Percy pulled Octavian down into a kiss. ""I want you to fuck me a bit. Until Luke comes. And then I want him to joining you"", said Percy. Octavian's eyes darkened in hunger. He hastily lubed his cock up and slipped his hands around Percy's waist to reach his ass, kneading it a couple of times before his fingers found Percy's waiting hole. At first Octavian only teased, the touch light and rhythmic, but since Percy promised them a big night just now, Octavian wanted more and he wanted it fast. Grasping Percy's ass-cheeks, he pulled them apart as he lined up with the tight hole. Percy liked the stretch and burn of not being so well-prepared. Octavian grunted as he thrust hard and sharp and deep. Percy moaned and threw his head back as Octavian assumed a fast and punctured pace, aiming for Percy's prostate. ""Ah. So you started the fun without me"", noted Luke amused as he entered. ""I'm just getting him warmed up for you, darling"", countered Octavian. ""Why don't you join me?"" ""Oh? Is that an actual offer?"", asked Luke intrigued as he started stripping down. Once naked, he crawled onto the bed to his lovers, watching in fascination how beautiful Octavian and Percy looked together, the pale augur fucking the tanned hero hard, both looking blissed-out. Octavian gripped Percy's butt harder and lifted him up, practically offering Percy's ass to Luke. Luke smirked, looking like a hungry lion as he lubed his cock up and leaned against Percy's back. ""So good for us, babe"", purred Luke pleased, kissing Percy's shoulder. ""Gonna take care of you."" ""That's what I already promised him"", pointed Octavian out. ""So please, go ahead and join me."" Percy craned his neck enough to look at Luke seductively. How could Luke possibly deny that? He lined up with Octavian's cock and eased in slowly, knowing that two dicks were quite the stretch on Percy. Percy whimpered softly and Octavian and Luke kissed him all over to sooth him. Percy closed his eyes and enjoyed the feeling of being pampered and kissed and taken care for tonight. After a short pause, Octavian continued thrusting and Luke finally started. They were a well-oiled machine, one thrust in just as the other pulled out. Percy loved how well his blondes worked together and especially when they worked together to wreck him. With the stimulation – intensified by Luke's cunning fingers around his cock, choking it and stroking it – Percy didn't last long. ""L—Luktavian"", moaned Percy as he spilled his seed. ""Lazy bastard"", snorted Luke amused and bit Percy's neck. ""Can't even properly moan two names."" ""Shaddap"", complained Percy as he went lax between them. He closed his eyes and just enjoyed how both his lovers continued fucking him hard until they came, nearly at the same time, filling him up with their warm, sticky cum. He knew it was a mess, the bed would be a mess in the morning, but he didn't quite care at the moment. He just enjoyed the sensation and the caresses. Both his blondes stayed inside of him as they laid down on the bed together. Luke tenderly trailed kisses along Percy's shoulders and neck, while Octavian traced Percy's face with his hands. Percy smiled softly at the Roman before he leaned in for a kiss. ""I'm glad I decided to stay"", whispered Percy, voice tired as he snuggled up to his lovers. ""Believe me, so are we, darling"", countered Octavian with a frown. ""Even though I still can not believe it myself. How did not just one but two annoying, stubborn, heroic, mischievous Greeks manage to worm their way into my heart? Impossible."" ""Yeah, we really are"", agreed Luke cheekily, leaning over Percy to kiss Octavian's cheek. Percy smiled sleepily, closing his eyes. ""Tomorrow, we go to the zoo with Danny..."" ""Yes, we will"", confirmed Luke, also kissing Percy. ""But for now, sleep some, Perce."" ~*~ The End ~*~"

""He's dorky and fun to talk to and kind and I look forward to my exhibitions the most because I get to see you..."" ""Well that... makes me an idiot then"", mused Nico with a frown. ""So I should have asked you out months ago then? Because I really wanted. But I thought, well, I don't know..."" ""You were being silly"", hummed Percy knowingly and stared up at the lawyer. ""But so was I, so I guess we deserve each other for being idiots, huh?"" ""Yes, I suppose we do"", laughed Nico, kissing Percy's cheek. ""I do. Love you, that is. And your art. The new series that I bought last night, it was so intense, it instantly inspired me. Which is why after the exhibition, I headed out to the train station to start a new piece myself."" ""It's funny"", chuckled Percy and tilted his head. ""You inspire me and I inspire you. Poetic, eh?"" ""It's sure going to be interesting"", hummed Nico, licking his lips. ""So... Would you like to come over to my place some time and be my model? Because I wanted to do a piece of you for a while now. You, the trains. I do have a vision for it, but I want to do you justice."" ""So, that's why you... made those sketches of me last night, yeah? Well... Okay. Only if I get to take a couple photos of you"", whispered Percy with a predatory gleam. ""What kind of emotion does a lawyer convey?"", snorted Nico amused. ""Oh. Not for a series. For me"", chimed Percy with a broad grin. ""Because I like looking at you."" ""That... feeling is mutual"", whispered Nico, caressing Percy's cheeks as though he was following the outlines of Percy's face. ""You're the most intense piece of art I've ever seen, Perseus. Your eyes... they're so expressive. I feel like getting lost in the swirl of emotions they present."" ""Flatterer"", whispered Percy red-cheeked. ""So... you busy at the moment?"" ""Very"", nodded Nico seriously, watching Percy falter a little. ""After all, I just cleared my schedule for an entire hour to talk to a new client. Now, Mister Jackson, what would you like to talk about?"" Percy's face instantly brightened again as he grinned at the lawyer. ""How about we go and grab a coffee and breakfast? Because I'm positively starving and I left my coffee in Rachel's clutches."" ""Yes. Breakfast sounds brilliant"", agreed Nico and got up before pressing a button on his phone. ""Miss Beauregard, I'll be out for the next hour. An important meeting. Do not bother me."" Not waiting for a reply from his secretary, he grasped Percy's hand to pull him along. /break\ It was somewhat poetic, Nico had to agree with that as they were in Rome two months later, Percy in the middle of a photo shooting on a hill overseeing the city while Nico sat on a bench close by and was capturing Percy in rough sketches that he'd be turning into a graffiti later on. Percy was interacting with the little girl with the ice-cream that he was trying to capture in a carefree moment. He got the moment as a flock of pigeons rose next to them and the little girl stared after them with an o-expression. Percy looked at her so fondly as he captured her between the rising birds and with the beauty of Rome in the background. Nico smiled pleased as he captured Percy's expression the moment he looked at the little girl. Being with Percy was so inspiring and fulfilling. He had tried to fill the void and longing ever since his sister had passed and Percy's art had come close, but being with Percy finally made him feel whole again. ""Thanks for your time, princess"", grinned Percy, ruffling the girl's hair. She giggled and ran off to her mom waiting at the sidelines. Both waved at Percy and Nico as they left again. Nico slowly packed his things up and walked over to his lover. Percy smiled brightly as he greeted Nico with a deep, passionate kiss. Grunting amused, Nico wrapped one arm around his lover's waist to pull him up against himself some more. Art made Percy horny, Nico knew that. And Nico appreciated that. Smirking into their kiss, Nico adjusted them both a little. ""I'm... glad we took the time for this vacation"", whispered Nico. ""It's a work trip"", chided Percy with a half-grin. ""Though, well, my work is more fun than work. And with you, it's actually even more fun. Thanks, for clearing your schedule for the week."" ""For you? Always"", smirked Nico and took Percy's hand. ""Now, shall we get back to the hotel?"" ""That is a great idea"", agreed Percy, leaning his head against Nico's shoulder as they walked. And truly, Percy's life had become a masterpiece after he became an artist. ~*~ The End ~*~ Author's note: This story was inspired by a conversation I had with a friend about the word ""wanderlust"", which is German and is being very much misused in the English language. Wanderlust means, literally and figuratively, the desire to go hiking. It's being used as what we Germans call ""Fernweh"" however. Fernweh is the yearning for other places, to travel the world, go on vacation, to literally just be away from where you are. It irked me that the English language decided to borrow a German word... but they just took the wrong one. Anyway, that's what inspired this story! Next update is going to be another Nicercy oneshot titled ""Sharing Pizza With a Prince"" on Wednesday; Prince Perseus of Atlantis is visiting New York with his family. On a gala, he talks to Nico, who is a cook and just there for work and really not interested in royals so he has no idea the cutie he's chatting up is actually a prince."
7,3,8,3-Takara-Phoenix-8.txt,percy-jackson-and-the-olympians,TakaraPhoenix,"enthusiastic way Percy would talk about it was worth listening to stuff he didn't know about. If Percy continued like that, Nico was going to start watching it. In return, Percy would let Nico ramble on about Star Wars . So in a way, both of them also enjoyed science fiction – they could, at least, agree on Star Trek in this section. To sum it up, Nico truly was head over heels and right now, he was sitting in an Italian restaurant, nervously shifting on his seat and waiting for Percy to arrive. He hadn't seen Percy in two weeks and he couldn't wait to talk to the other boy in person again. ""Sorry to keep you waiting, Bucky. Of course my professor was in rant-mode today."" ""No problem, Korra. You're worth the wait"", replied Nico with a grin. He barely managed to keep his pokerface at the sight in front of him. Percy was wearing a blue dress-shirt and rather tight dress-pants. Aside from the clothes that complimented Percy's body quite well, it was more the area of Percy's face that stunned him. He realized he hadn't seen Percy without the wig and contacts yet. Percy's hair was a mess, roughly two inches of black, fluffy hair. Nico instantly had the urge to run his fingers through it. The most startling thing however were Percy's eyes. They weren't silvery-gray or golden-amber, no, they were even more impressive. They were something between green and blue, like those two colors were clashing, fighting in Percy's irises. Nico was pretty sure he could spend hours just staring into those eyes, watching that battle. ""Uhm? Nico? Still in there somewhere? Now I'm relieved you're sitting, because I'm pretty sure you'd run into a wall again right about now"", said a voice, interrupting Nico's thoughts. Shaking his head, Nico looked at Percy apologetically. ""Sorry. You distracted me. Again."" ""I tend to do that a lot"", agreed Percy, mischievous smile on his lips. ""Better not drive in a car with you behind the wheel, mh? What in the world is it that distracts you so much?"" ""All of this , quite obviously"", grunted Nico with a frown, indicating to all of Percy again. ""I'll make sure you get a mirror for your birthday, because you apparently don't own one. Those strong arms of yours, that taunt stomach, the cheekbones and pink lips and that ridiculously cute nose and those hair and have you ever actually seen your eyes? Because I'm pretty sure that color doesn't exist!"" ""Oh. Uhm. Okay"", nodded Percy, cheeks turning darker and darker. ""And your legs seem pretty much endless. Like, how are they so long? You're not exactly tall! It's like they're trying to force me to imagine what they'd look like wrapped around my waist"", continued Nico, stuck in ramble-mode. ""And, okay that one I could even believe that you haven't really seen yet, but you have an incredibly hot ass. It's begging to be squeezed, really."" ""You can stop talking any time now"", mumbled Percy, face ridiculously red. ""...Right. Sorry"", muttered Nico, face matching Percy's in color. ""You're just... really something. And like your incredibly enchanting exterior isn't enough, you have to be this... sweet, kind, caring guy with that big heart and all this dorkiness that I adore. You're amazing."" ""Way to swoop a guy off his feet on the first date"", whispered Percy with a small grin. Nico shifted a little in his chair. So that had gone smoothly. A ton of word-vomit that made him sound more like a fanboy than a potential boyfriend. He didn't understand. Sure, he wasn't the best when it came to social interactions, but he wasn't that awkward normally. Percy however made him feel like an utter fool, yet also like the happiest person on the planet at the very same time. He blamed the age difference. He had never been with someone who was more than a year apart from him before. But he also saw a thrill in this. The goal of having this gorgeous college student beneath him at one point. Not tonight. Tonight was all about the romance and showing Percy that Nico, even though he was far younger than Percy, was still the perfect match for him. During dinner, they talked animatedly, barely catching a breath in between. It was for both of them entirely too easy to talk to each other. They shared their food, feeding each other and laughing when one of them missed. Afterward, they decided to take a big dessert together. Nico smiled softly as Percy had a little bit of chocolate sauce in the corner of his mouth when they stood. ""You... have a little bit of something there"", noted Nico, grasping Percy's chin. ""Let me."" Percy blushed as Nico kissed the corner of his mouth. For a moment, time seemed to freeze as they were only a breath away. Percy tilted his head enough to properly capture Nico's lips. Nico hummed softly, relieved to get this reaction out of the other. He slowly laid his arms around Percy's waist and pulled the green-eyed beauty close until they were chest to chest. Percy grinned into their kiss as he wrapped his arms around Nico's neck, tilting the Italian's head down to deepen the kiss. ""You know, you're pretty amazing too"", whispered Percy breathlessly at the end of their kiss. ""Does that make us amazing boyfriends now?"", inquired Nico teasingly as he led the way out of the restaurant, fingers linked with Percy's. ""Because I really, really, really like you."" ""That's good, because I'm holding you to your promise to be the Asami to my Korra"", said Percy. ~*~ The End ~*~ Author's note: Because I recently fell in love with the Avatar cartoons and all I could think was ""Damn, Korra is Percy's spirit animal. They're like siblings"", which then evolved to ""Damn, Korra's (first season) outfit would look great on Percy ôo"". So here it is, Percy cosplaying Avatar."
8,3,36,3-Takara-Phoenix-36.txt,percy-jackson-and-the-olympians,TakaraPhoenix,"into a giggling fit, curling together and closer toward Nico. Nico grinned, proud he could make Percy laugh like that. By the time Percy was calmed down a bit, they laid decidedly much closer together. Both blushed a little as they stared into each other's eyes. ""Would... it be alright if I kissed you?"", asked Percy softly and unsure. ""...What?"", asked Nico a bit dumbly. Percy blushed and shrugged. ""I thought I was kinda getting vibes from you... Like, you know, gay vibes and you checking me out vibes and stuff like that... So, no kissing then?"" ""Yeah, no, totally gay!"", interrupted Nico hastily. ""Also totally checking you out. Just didn't expect you to... to notice. Or to want to kiss me. You... sure about kissing me?"" ""I dunno. The moment felt right. Now, the moment feels awkward"", shrugged Percy. ""...Yeah, it kinda does"", sighed Nico frustrated. ""Still up for a kiss though?"" Percy grinned amused as he bridged the last bit of space between them, sealing Nico's lips with his own. Percy's were soft and tasted like strawberries – from his toothpaste. Nico grinned into the kiss, moving his lips against Percy's slowly and carefully. They scooted closer and closer to each other, until Percy was laying on top of Nico, straddling his waist. Nico's arms found their way around Percy's waist and then they slowly inched more down until he managed to cup a feel of Percy's butt. For a second there, Percy stiffened before he relaxed into the touch as Nico squeezed down. Slowly, Nico started massaging the firm butt, making Percy whimper into their kiss. ""So... that makes us..."", drawled Percy out, slowly licking his lips. ""Honestly, whatever you want us to be"", admitted Nico with a frown, pinching Percy's butt. Percy yelped a little before clasping a hand over his mouth and glaring. ""The kids . Downstairs. Take your hands off the goods, di Angelo, you little perv."" ""But it's such a gorgeous butt"", pouted Nico with the smallest grin. ""Boyfriends"", whispered Percy against Nico's lips. ""What?"", asked Nico very confused. ""What it makes us. What I want it to make us"", clarified Percy. ""Boyfriends. I'm not a boy for a little making out between friends, or something like that."" ""Good"", nodded Nico relieved. ""You sure?"", asked Percy with a frown. ""Uh, yeah, otherwise I wouldn't say it's good?"", offered Nico confused. ""Just, you know, Luke mentioned to me that you're a bit – and that means a lot – of a playboy"", pointed Percy out, one eyebrow raised. ""I think his exact words were 'Watch your ass around di Angelo or you'll have it spanked and fucked before you know'."" ""...Ah, Castellan, wonderful. Thank you"", grunted Nico offended, glaring darkly. ""But... I mean... I... like you. I like you a lot. Lot more than... I ever liked anyone before. I want more than a quick fuck from you, Percy. I'd... I'd like to be boyfriends. If you really want to try it with me."" ""Sure. I'll teach you the monogamous ways, di Angelo"", teased Percy amused, kissing the corner of Nico's lips. ""But just a fair warning; I catch you with someone else, I'll do much more than just dump your sorry ass, I will also make you regret it for the rest of your life. We clear on that?"" ""Absolutely"", nodded Nico, pulling Percy closer and into a soft kiss. They spent about an hour snuggled together and kissing, until they fell asleep in each other's arms. /break\ ""So you're now officially dating Nico di Angelo, mh?"", asked Rachel teasingly. Rachel and Percy were in some classes together. He was glad to have a familiar face around, in the big sister of Tyson's best friend. Tyson and Ella of course adored that their big siblings were friends. Percy blushed a little, smiled and nodded his head. He shifted his backpack some. ""He really makes you happy, mh?"", asked Rachel, not as teasing anymore. ""That's good. I'm happy for you, Percy. You deserve to be happy, you know."" ""Thanks"", smiled Percy. ""So, since you love me so much and want me to be happy, surely you'll be more than glad to pick up Tyson for me today and watch him for a couple of hours, because my boyfriend is picking me up to go on a date with him?"" Rachel huffed and rolled her eyes, just to have Percy give her his unbeatable kitten-eyes. ""Yes."" ""Aw, you're the best, Rach!"", exclaimed Percy, kissing Rachel's cheek. There was a sparkle in Rachel's eyes as she watched him check the parking lot. When he spotted a black bike with blue flame-motifs on it. On top of the bike sat Nico – in his black leather jacket, black leather pants and with the black leather gloves, with one helmet hanging on the handle of the bike and another helmet under his arm. Percy's eyes darkened when he saw his boyfriend in all the leather. Percy liked the leathery Nico. Licking his lips, Percy grinned. ""Please. Please just go to Nico and stop eye-fucking"", groaned Rachel, rolling her eyes. Percy turned to grin at Rachel one last time before he ran over, straight into the open arms of his still relatively new boyfriend. Nico's arms instantly wound their way around his waist to pull him closer until the two could kiss. Two weeks into their relationship and they kissed basically as often as possible. Nico never thought he'd be this happy with one person. ""Hey, babe"", whispered Nico pleased, caressing Percy's cheek. ""Hello yourself"", grinned Percy delighted, pecking Nico's lips again. ""So, plan for today?"" ""A movie, then we go to that beach in Montauk that you like so much and could eat something there? Just gotta buy it first on the way. What do you feel like?"", asked Nico. ""Pizza. I'm really hungry for Italian"", purred Percy teasingly, putting the helmet on. ""Dork"", snorted Nico, rolling his eyes as they drove off together. ~*~ The End ~*~"
9,3,24,3-Takara-Phoenix-24.txt,percy-jackson-and-the-olympians,TakaraPhoenix,"bit embarrassed. ""I... feel better sitting in your lap and..."" ""You don't need to justify yourself, darling"", murmured Nico soothingly, trailing kisses along Percy's neck. ""If you want me to hold you a while longer, I'm glad to do that."" Nico watched with hawk eyes how Percy's nimble fingers with much preciseness finished what looked like a delicious parfait. Nico's arms remained around Percy's waist the entire time, until Percy was done and Nico reached out to get one spoon out of the cupboard. Percy raised one confused eyebrow, at least until Nico scooped up white cream and a raspberry and offered it to Percy. With pink cheeks did Percy open his mouth and accept the treat. They ate in companionable silence, Nico feeding the both of them until the dessert was gone. ""That was very delicious"", praised Nico pleased. ""Shall we move this to my bedroom?"" Grinning cheekily, Percy laid his arms around Nico's neck, holding on tight. Rolling his eyes fondly, Nico lifted Percy up and carried him upstairs to his bedroom, where he sprawled his baker out on the bed. Percy more than eagerly spread his legs in invitation. But before Nico joined his lover, he shed his own clothes, leaving them on a pile on the ground as he crawled into the bed. ""I'm going to make love to you now, amore"", whispered Nico softly, watching Percy relax. He ran his fingers over Percy's thighs, grasping them and lifting them up so they were bent. Then Nico went to get the lube from his nightstand. Spreading a lot of it over his dick, just to make sure, he leaned down to kiss Percy again. While their tongues battled for dominance, Nico cautiously pulled the vibrator out of his lover. As they parted, he shook his head a little in astonishment and put the toy aside. Percy grinned sheepishly up at him – and Nico fell just a little more in love with the baker. Taking a deep breath, Nico slowly eased his way into the tight hot channel of his boyfriend. He groaned blissfully – fingering the baker was one thing, but feeling him around his dick? Incredible. So much better than anything he could have pictured. It took all his willpower to hold back once he was deep inside his lover. He distracted himself by kissing Percy again, rougher this time, biting Percy's lips hungrily. Percy groaned into their kiss, rolling his hips in a silent demand and baring his neck in a pleading offer. Nico obeyed both; trailing kisses down Percy's jawline and slowly starting to rock his hips back and forth. Movement slow at first, Nico picked up the pace soon. It was too good, so tight, squeezing Nico's cock like that. ""F—Fuck"", groaned Percy, eyes squeezed tightly shut. ""N—Need to come, please!"" ""Sh, I know, mio prezioso"", cooed Nico tenderly. ""I know, it's been five days, right? Come for me."" His fingers were so cunning as they ran up and down Percy's aching cock and the way Nico repeated to hit his prostate was driving the baker positively insane. When the fire fighter circled the head of Percy's cock and teased his slit, Percy couldn't help but whimper and come into his lover's hand. Nico groaned strangled as Percy's muscles contorted around his dick. Jerking forward one last time, Nico came deep inside his boyfriend, crashing their lips together during his orgasm. Only when he came down from his high did Nico roll off his lover and held onto him tightly. Percy hummed contently, snuggling up to his boyfriend, palm spread out right over Nico's heart. ""That... That was worth the wait"", whispered Percy breathlessly. ""Can we repeat it soon?"" Chuckling fondly, Nico slipped his hands down to rest on the still heated and sore ass, squeezing it until Percy whimpered softly. While occasionally squeezing, Nico slipped his fingers to the loose, cum-oozing hole, playing with it. Percy buried his face in Nico's chest in embarrassment. The small smile on Percy's lips however told the fire fighter that Percy bathed in the attention. ""Do you... Do you want to move in with me?"", asked Nico after about half an hour of naked cuddling and Nico playing with Percy's ass. ""I—I know you have a couple apartments picked out to look at soon. I know both of us are annoyed that we never have privacy when we're at your place. I am very, very annoyed that I don't get to see you as often as I'd like. I know I enjoy this, right now, just holding you. I'd like to do that every night possible."" For a moment, he was afraid Percy would say no, or laugh at him, but then Percy looked up at him with happily sparkling eyes, heaving a relieved sigh. "" Finally . I've been waiting for you to ask for like weeks now! What do you think why I put looking for a place off so much? I got the insurance money a month ago. But... I kept thinking about living all on my own again and how much I'd hate it and how much I like your sisters and Frank and Leo by now and how much I'd like to fall asleep in your arms, how much I'd want to be able to spend more time with you."" Nico blinked slowly before grinning. That was just such a Percy-thing to say. Smiling, Nico leaned down to capture Percy in a deep, slow kiss, conveying all the love he held for his boyfriend. He grew giddy at the thought, the picture of coming home not just to his family but to his love. ~*~ The End ~*~ Author's note: Well then, I hope you enjoyed this little AU! This is what happens when I'm ODing on the Chicago franchise. Next update will be on Saturday again, this time it's ""Chasing Fireflies"" turn and after that, I am hopeful that I'll be able to regain my Wednesday/Saturday schedule again."
10,3,56,3-Takara-Phoenix-56.txt,percy-jackson-and-the-olympians,TakaraPhoenix,"he was really, truly more than just an affair to the gods. ""Hold on"", ordered Percy as he was crowded against the closed bedroom door. He had moved to the royal bedroom weeks ago already. Hades and Persephone both didn't look very pleased as they were stopped from ravishing their new royal consort. Percy bit his lower lip as he looked up at them. All three were wearing white, beautiful togas from their wedding. Percy lifted his right hand and concentrated very hard. With becoming the royal consort, he also became a god. With a snap of his fingers, he tested his new godly powers. Considering the sharp intake of breaths, he guessed it had worked. When he opened his eyes and peeked out between his lovers, he could see himself in the large mirror. Well. He looked even better in the white wedding dress than anticipated. A slight yelp escaped him when Hades attacked his mouth feverishly. ""Well, don't we have a pretty little bride there"", purred Persephone delighted. ""Mhmh"", grunted Hades in agreement, hands finding Percy's ass. ""What does the pretty little bride want us to do with her though? Certainly not ruin that pretty dress though, right?"" ""Daddy, I want you to fuck me. Please"", requested Percy gently. ""I can keep the dress on, daddy?"" ""Mh, that sounds like a good plan, princess"", chuckled Hades delighted. ""Persephone?"" ""Oh, absolutely"", grinned the queen delighted, gathering the white dress up. Percy yelped delighted as he felt her sneaky fingers working their way into his hole. He groaned pleased as he was pinned between them, Hades biting and nibbling his neck while Persephone prepared him. After a few minutes, the two older gods switched their work. Hades took over prepping him while Persephone left a last hickey on his neck before she went to the bed. She slowly shed her clothes, aware of the two hungry pairs of eyes on her body. When she reached for her large strap-on, Percy made a pleased sound in the back of his throat. He loved when she prepped him for Hades by fucking him. Persephone sat down against the headboard and licked her lips. ""Come here and ride me, princess"", ordered Persephone, beckoning him over. Hades smirked and took the long white veil attached to Percy's hair with white roses and used it to tie Percy's hands behind his back. Percy gasped as he was guided over to kneel over Persephone's lap. Two sets of hands grasped him by the thighs and held him in place. ""Are you going to be a good girl for daddy?"", asked Hades with a dark voice. ""Will you be good and ride your brother's cock hard for daddy, mh? Be daddy's good little princess?"" Percy flushed pleased. They had finally worked out all the kinks of their kinks. He lowered himself onto Persephone's fake cock, trying to angle for his own prostate. Hades slapped his butt in encouragement, urging him on to go faster. Percy obliged, lifting himself off and bringing himself down again. He whimpered softly and craned his neck to pout at Hades. The god rolled his eyes and continued spanking Percy through the whole ride to urge him on. Percy smiled pleased as he rolled his hips slowly. Persephone beneath him watched with dark eyes, enjoying the sight thoroughly. ""Aren't you a good girl?"", asked Persephone with a grin. ""I'm sure you can go faster, doll."" Percy nodded and moved faster, thighs shaking with the strain of it the longer he went on. His cock was aching and begging for attention, but he wasn't daring to ask them for attention just yet. Hades came to kneel behind him, hands on Percy's thighs, hot breath ghosting over his neck. ""You're doing very good, princess"", whispered Hades darkly. ""You think you can take us both?"" Percy's eyes widened, making Persephone laugh lightly and smack his butt once. ""Come on. We know you've been thinking about it, doll. I'm sure you can take me and daddy, right?"" Percy bit his lips hard, stupid grin on his face as he nodded. ""Yes, I'm sure I can, daddy."" He craned his neck to look up at Hades endearingly. Hades groaned at the innocent look alone. Persephone grabbed Percy by the ass-cheeks and pulled them apart in invitation for her husband. An invitation Hades gladly took. He carefully eased his way in beside Persephone's strap-on, causing Percy to whimper and whine softly, tugging on his bonds a little. Both his lovers cooed soothingly at him until Hades was fully seated inside. They gave him a moment to adjust. ""Daddy, daddy, please move, please"", begged Percy when the way took too long. ""Please, daddy?"" ""How could I ever deny my princess?"", chuckled Hades, kissing Percy's shoulder. Percy groaned and threw his head back against Hades' shoulder as the god started fucking him for earnest. The movement easily lifted him off Persephone's toy too, then pushed him back down. Persephone all the while found Percy's neglected cock beneath the white dress and in the rhythm of Hades' thrusts did she start jerking him off. Percy groaned and moaned as his lovers fucked him. ""Can you come for us, princess?"", asked Hades, Percy's pulse caught between his teeth. ""Come for daddy, baby girl? You're doing so good for me, mh?"" ""Da—addy"", gasped Percy strangled as he came into Persephone's hand. ""Such a good little consort we got there"", smiled Persephone pleased, offering her hand to Percy and brushing her cum-covered fingers against his lips. ""Be a good girl and clean that up."" Eagerly, Percy opened his mouth and started sucking on the offered fingers while Hades fucked him even harder until the king came deep inside his new royal consort. They made sure to straighten up Percy's pretty dress as they sprawled down on the bed together, legs intertwined and gentle kisses shared between the three of them. Percy smiled softly as he soaked up their love like that. ~*~ The End ~*~"

Seriously, the people he cared about were way too emotional and clingy. /break\ It took Percy and Nico about half a month before they found the perfect apartment and another week before they were finally moved in, thanks to the help of all their friends. Sure, they still had some cardboard boxes standing around in the halls and the study, but the most basic and important things were all in place. Like their bed, the kitchen, the couch and the TV. Right now, they were curled together on the couch, Nico behind Percy and with his arms around the Sea Prince's waist to keep him pressed close against Nico's chest. They were watching the final two-parter of Danny Phantom – due to moving, they hadn't gotten to finish their marathon just yet. ""Nick?"", inquired Percy softly, just before the big show-down. ""Mh?"", grunted Nico in acknowledgment. ""I love you."" ""I know"", grunted Nico, now a little confused. ""Yeah, I know that you know, but I just... felt like saying it"", shrugged Percy, blushing a bit. ""Just... laying here with you, like that, it... makes me just love you so much, I guess..."" ""That's cute"", grinned Nico, kissing Percy's cheek. ""You're adorable, gattino."" ""What does that mean?"", asked Percy hastily. ""I meant to ask that for a while now!"" ""It means 'kitten'. Because you reminded me so much of one when you were shrunk"", explained Nico, kissing Percy's earlobe. ""You were so affectionate and you actually purr ."" ""I snore. I don't purr. I'm not a cat"", objected the embarrassed son of Poseidon. ""Yeah, no. You're my kitten"", declared Nico with a smirk. ""You're so horrible"", groaned Percy flustered. ""Your fault. You make me horrible"", countered Nico with a soft laugh. /break\ ""Babe? Are you home?"", called Nico as he entered the apartment, holding his backpack in one hand and a book he was reading in the other hand. ""Gattino? Hello? Kitty-kitty-kitty-cat!"" ""Oh stop it, you-"", started an annoyed voice from the living room. Grinning teasingly, Nico dumped his backpack at the door and continued on. It had been a year of dating and living together and things couldn't go better. Percy truly had blossomed back to that heroic, gorgeous and happy boy Nico had first met all those years ago. He enjoyed hanging out with their friends again, was more open about sharing his feelings again, not just with Nico. Even though Nico was still his most trusted confider, especially when it came to Tartarus or his past abuse. ""Mh, such a good, little student"", teased Nico amused as he found his boyfriend on the floor. Percy was laying in the middle of what looked like an intense study-session. Multiple books and notepads and notes spread out all around Percy, as well as one plate of blue chocolate cookies from Sally (to make the hard studying easier). Percy sat up some, enough to reach out for Nico. The son of Hades knelt down next to him to steal a kiss and then a cookie. ""How was the praetor-meeting?"", asked Percy, licking his lips. ""Good, I guess"", nodded Nico and got more comfortable. ""Exhausting, I guess. But our new augur is a sweet thing. Rather young, but Danny seems like a good girl."" After Reyna had retired to join the hunt and travel, fight and hunt with her girlfriend Thalia, Nico had been elected praetor, much to his own surprise. The Romans had been joyous to find the ambassador of Pluto who had helped save them all back in their midst. Nico had accepted. ""Still worried how being praetor will affect your school-life"", pointed Percy out, frowning. ""Babe, the only thing affecting my school-life are you and your naked body waiting for me in our bed in the evenings"", whispered Nico amused, licking his lips hungrily. Percy blushed, as he often did when that pierced tongue did pretty much anything. It only reminded him of all the naughty things that tongue and that piercing could do to him. His face darkened. ""Oh, shut up"", muttered the son of Poseidon embarrassed. Nico laughed loudly as he watched Percy's facial color. He had to admit, making Percy blush was one of his favorite pastimes. He shifted enough to be really comfortable, folding his arms over Percy's smaller back and resting his chin on top of them as he watched his lover. ""You're so cute"", grinned Nico, trailing his pierced tongue along Percy's neck. ""D—Don't do that"", hissed Percy irritated. ""I'm trying to study."" ""Yes, I'm just testing your concentration"", hummed Nico. ""Oh come on, don't be such a nerd."" ""Don't be such a rebel. I have to finish this"", huffed Percy. ""Sorry, it's just... you're driving me completely crazy"", whispered the son of Hades. ""Well, the feeling is mutual, though right now, it's not meant as a positive thing"", grunted Percy. Nico just grinned and hummed. Percy was so easy to tease. Cuddling up to the older boy, Nico just stayed silently at his side and watched Percy work. The day had been exhausting. School and then praetor-duties. By now it was already pretty late, but as long as Percy would be waiting for him at home, he always had something to look forward to. He still often visited Camp Half-Blood, or his friends would come over. Lou would be graduating this year and she already promised she'd be moving to New Rome for college too. His plan however was still to become a doctor and Percy was more than supportive of this – always with red ears and flushed cheeks. Nico knew exactly what kind of thoughts were running through Percy's head when he thought about Doctor di Angelo. Which was all the more motivation to reach his goals. ""We're still on for dinner with my sister today though, right?"", inquired Nico. Percy just smiled in reply, pulling Nico into a kiss. Yes, life was perfect. ~*~ The End ~*~"

But ever since the water had been poisoned, Nico had ordered his herd to stay inside the cave. Only those too stubborn to obey him and too close to leave him on his own still followed him outside. ""It's not dangerous. That's Percy, he's our new water nymph, which means you can leave the caves again"", replied Nico, watching how the two fawns high-fived. ""Not without your parents' permission, of course. Now, what are you two doing here anyway?"" ""Ma says to wash up for breakfast cos we got a guest"", replied the female fawn, frowning. ""Him?"" ""Him"", confirmed Nico with a nod, observing how his nymph resurfaced. Percy gasped deeply as he resurfaced again, supporting himself on the cliff, blinking. He blinked a couple more times when he came face to face with a little brunette fawn. The boy stared at him curiously with his nougat-brown eyes, gaping at Percy like he was something totally awesome. ""You're totally awesome"", whispered the little fawn, blinking himself. ""I like water nymphs! They can swim really fast and dive really deep and talk to fishies and they're pretty and blue!"" Percy blinked again, tilting his head some. Grinning brightly, he reached out to pat the little boy's head. The brown deer-ears twitched at that. Percy cooed when he felt the tiny horns. ""My, you'll be a great and strong stag one day, mh? You already have such big antlers"", smiled Percy amused, watching how the little boy puffed his chest out at that. ""Hello, little ones. My name is Percy, I'll be staying with her herd from now on. What are your names, sweetlings?"" ""Those are Calandra and Chrysander, they're the fawns of Clarisse and Chris"", stated Nico. ""Sander!"", corrected the little boy and wiggled his nose. ""Is Sander. Hello, Percy."" ""Hello, Sander"", smiled Percy brightly. ""And Calandra. It's nice to meet you."" Calandra frowned and sniffed the air. ""Is he pregnant? He smells like auntie Annie did when she was pregnant. Where's his mate? Do we get little playmates then? Will they be nymphs too?"" ""I'm his mate and... we don't know if it'll be nymphs or fawns"", replied Nico amused. ""Now get into the water, you're reeking, little ones. And then we'll go and eat breakfast together, mh?"" He gave each little fawn a push and watched them hit the water with a yelp. Percy giggled as he climbed out of the lagoon and came to sit next to his mate, leaning against his proud stag. Nico hummed and wrapped his arms around his mate, pulling Percy onto his lap. ""They're cute"", smiled Percy as he watched Sander and Calandra swim. ""Will ours be cute too?"" ""Cuter even"", nodded Nico, sounding very sure. ""They'd have your beauty, my love."" /break\ Six months later would prove Nico's words to be true. Percy was laying curled together on their moss-bed, holding onto a tiny little stag. The youngling had Nico's olive-skin, though the soft fur on his belly was tinted blue like Percy's skin and Percy could feel the tiny little bumps of antlers between the dark curls on the fawn's head. A blue deer. Percy's little miracle. ""It's cute! And tiny! Can I have it?"" Percy blinked a couple of times and looked up at an excited little Sander. The boy had gotten very attached to Percy and the larger Percy's stomach grew, the curiouser and more protective did the little fawn grow. If Percy wouldn't have been in such labor-pains, he would have laughed at how cute Sander had been pacing next to Nico. Nico chuckled amused from where he laid next to his mate, holding their other fawn. A precious little female who suckled on Nico's finger. ""No, you can't have it. It's our son"", stated Nico amused. ""Sander, meet Bianca Maria and her brother Hades Poseidon. Our newest little fawns. Now, as their elder, you're responsible for them too, you know that, right? A herd looks out for each other."" ""Okay"", nodded Sander obediently and leaned over the tiny male to sniff his belly, completely fascinated by the blue fur the boy was sprouting. ""Oi! Tell it to stop! It can't do that!"" Percy bit his lips as he watched his little son. Donny – because as honorable as it was to name the little one after their deceased fathers, he needed a cute name for a cute kid – was making grabby motions for Sander. And since Sander was leaning over Donny to sniff his belly, Donny had managed to get a hold of Sander's antlers and was now happily suckling on it. ""No, that's not for eating"", chided Percy amused and pulled Donny off. Donny looked upset at that, making more grabby-motions for Sander. Sander tilted his head curiously, poking the tiny fawn. It was cute and weird and tiny. Sander grinned broadly. ""I'll keep it safe, uncle Nico!"", promised Sander. ""That's good"", praised Nico. ""Now go back to your parents, Percy needs the rest."" While Sander nodded and dashed off, Percy curled against his mate, holding their children close. ~*~ The End ~*~ Author's note: Tomorrow is the American release date for BoO.

13,3,13,3-Takara-Phoenix-13.txt,percy-jackson-and-the-olympians,TakaraPhoenix,"anyone. Not wanting to burden them. Annabeth had decided to attend school there and to move to New York so she could watch over him and try to help the boy she loved so very much. Another painful jolt was going through her being. She loved him, but perhaps not the way she used to. Not anymore. Ever since they had been reunited, something seemed so very off. All the things that had changed him, that had been wearing him down, they had also caused a raft between them. And Annabeth's close bond with Piper wasn't helping any. During the months before the Argo II launched, she had already spend a lot of time bonding with Piper, but by now, it felt like what they had was the most intimate relationship she had ever had. And they weren't even romantically involved. But they knew exactly what the other was thinking and wanted to say, they communicated without words, something they had perfected during this mission. Something she had once been able to with Percy too, to an extend. Never as brilliantly simple as with Piper though. And not anymore either. Since Tartarus, Annabeth knew that she had no idea anymore what Percy was thinking. What once used to be an open book to her now held seven seals – one from the Titan War, one from the abduction by Hera, one from the memory loss, one from the wolves, one from the Romans, one from Tartarus, one from the Giant War. Which didn't mean she was going to give up on him. He was still her best friend, even though her feelings may have changed. She would always love him, one way or another. ""Where is Percy anyway?"", asked Annabeth and stood. ""Downstairs"", chuckled Paul, shaking his head fondly. ""You know he and Sally had been attached by the hip ever since you two came home this morning..."" Annabeth shared his fond expression as they climbed down the stairs to find the two Jacksons curled together on the couch. Percy had his legs pulled up against his chest, his mother's one arm around him, caressing his side as he practically melted into hers. He looks so small and fragile right there that Annabeth had no hard time imagining what Percy must have been like as a kid. She didn't judge. On the contrary, she wished she could have that too. A family that loved her and could be there for her, cared for her in that extend. She knew Percy needed the comfort – she was grateful Sally could provide it. It was what she had hoped for, actually. That being back home would give Percy the chance to let go. During the quest, she assumed, he just knew it had been the wrong time to have a mental melt-down. He stayed strong and firm, was the leader and hero others expected him to be, even though she could only guess that deep down all he wanted to do was curl together in his mom's lap and hide from the world. The last war had already torn at him, but so soon after another one right away? It didn't help that he was probably feeling guilty for having put his mother through all that pain over the last eight months of his disappearance. He needed someone who could be strong for him now, after everything he had been through. And Annabeth knew she wasn't the one. Because she couldn't be strong any longer either. /Jason&Piper\ Jason knew what was to come the moment Piper entered the Zeus Cabin. He had anticipated that ever since they had recreated their fake-memory kiss. The kiss itself had been amazing, the scenery had been perfect. But they weren't. The reminder of how they had gotten together in the first place was lingering between them ever since. They had barely spoken a word since then – Piper mostly spending her time with Annabeth while Jason kept watch-duty at Nico's bedside (because it was either that or Will would tie the son of Hades down there to make sure he rested and given that choice, Nico rather preferred the Roman babysitter, thank you very much). Their relationship was based on false memories. Without those, would they have ever gotten together to begin with? Jason had witnessed it during the war – the special connection Piper shared with Annabeth. It ran deeper than what they had. He knew that. He was just biding his time by now. ""Jason, I... think we should talk"", whispered the daughter of Aphrodite and sat down next to him. He just offered her a smile as he put his glasses down to polish them. ""It's alright, Pipes."" ""Mh?"", inquired Piper confused, observing how Jason seemed focused on his glasses. He was decidedly not looking at her. ""I know. And it's alright. But... we're still friends, right?"" A small half-smile came to her lips as she nodded and leaned over to engulf him in a tight hug. ""I... Yes. I just... I think I'm in love with Annabeth. And that's not fair to you."" ""But you know there's a little obstacle called Percy Jackson in the way, right?"", asked Jason. ""Well, you jumped ships once. Would you jump them again?"", asked Piper with a nearly mischievous gleam in her eyes. ""Will's dating Jake – come on, how do you not know that? You can't push him and Nico. But maybe... You and me, combining forces..."" ""Sounds like we're plotting world-domination and not the dating life of our friends"", laughed Jason. Author's note: I wanted to wait with posting this until I have all three chapters - it's a three-parter - written. Buuut I'm currently also working on three different oneshots that take the post-BoO-turn, so I wanted the biiig one out first before any oneshots. As just mentioned, three chapters.

""W—Where did you get my coat?"", asked the Italian stunned. ""I made sure to lock all my clothes up in my room before Hazel's little party started to take place!"" ""That's not yours"", huffed Percy and rolled his eyes. ""I told you about how I met someone. I met him at Luke's Halloween-party and when he brought me home, he gave me his coat."" ""Yeah, no. That's my coat. My father had it tailored specifically for me"", grunted Nico and shook his head. ""I gave it to Perseus on the... Perseus. Per cy . Don't tell me your name is actually Perseus?"" ""It's embarrassing, but yeah my mom has this thing for the Greek myths"", muttered Percy, before his eyes widened and his breath hitched. ""Wait. That means you're my Death Angel."" "" Your Death Angel?"", asked Nico with amusement dancing in his eyes. ""Uh... eh... well..."", mumbled Percy awkwardly, blushing brightly. ""Though... I thought your name was Perseus Blofis..."", mused Nico curiously. ""Well, it is Perseus. But Blofis is my stepfather's last name. I kept my mom's maiden name when they got married. No need to change my name because of that"", shrugged Percy awkwardly. ""Oh for Christ's sake, stop talking and kiss me already, will you?!"" The blushing jock glared and grabbed Nico by the neck, pulling him into the kiss that he had longed for for three weeks. His eyes fluttered shut as he leaned into the tender touch and he melted into the embrace as Nico finally reacted and laid his arms around Percy's waist. ""Your Death Angel"", whispered Nico, sounding very much like he was agreeing with the notion. ""Yup. Mine"", nodded Percy with a bright grin. ""Well, Perseus, it seems you truly do have more layers than a cake"", huffed Nico. ""You're nothing like how I thought a jock like you was supposed to be. I suppose I should apologize for that."" ""If by 'apologize', you mean 'kiss', then yes please, apologize as much as you want"", grinned Percy broadly. ""And I'm guessing you're going to keep calling me that from now on, huh?"" ""Perseus?"", asked Nico, the name more like a purr, causing Percy to shudder. ""Yes. Definitely."" ""It's way too cliche to be making out in the closet. I mean, I get that you're not ready to get out of the metaphorical closet just yet, Perce, but don't take it so literal."" ""Leo! Get out of here! I'm having a private moment!"", exclaimed Percy embarrassed. There, in the doorway, stood a broadly grinning Latino, wiggling his eyebrows suggestively. ""I'm sure Paul will pay me good money if I return you home with your virginity still intact."" Percy's face was beet-red and Nico cocked one intrigued eyebrow, caressing Percy's flushed cheeks. ""Mh, now that's something to be looking forward to then, mio bello."" ""Urgh, I hate you. Both of you"", groaned Percy and threw his head back. ""Yeah, well, you're welcome . I obviously helped you getting over your crush"", huffed Leo. ""You didn't. Nico is my crush!"", exclaimed Percy, his blush darkening. ""I mean-"" ""I think we all know what you mean"", chuckled Nico, amused by Percy's embarrassment before turning toward Leo. ""He means that I'm the guy from the party. You must be the best friend."" ""Oh. My. Gosh. Do you know what that means, Perce?!"", yelped Leo high-pitched. ""That... I may have a boyfriend now...?"", offered Percy, throwing an uncertain look at Nico. While Nico nodded firmly like he wanted to say 'What kind of question is that? Of course you're mine now!', Leo just shook his head widely. ""No, dumbass! That means we're so going to be brothers-in-law! Since your boyfriend is my girlfriend's brother! I gotta tell Hazel!"" The Latino turned on his heels and dashed off, rambling to himself. Nico and Percy exchanged an amused look before Nico took Percy by the hand and led him out of the closet. ""Let me bring you home safely, Perseus"", insisted the Italian, one arm around Percy's waist. Percy just smiled happily and leaned against his boyfriend's side. ""Totally fine by me."" /Omake – One Week Later\ Sally was frowning a little confused. Was Percy going through some kind of phase? She had heard that some rebelling teenagers turned goth or emo or whatever the dressed-in-black-kids were called these days when they wanted to 'make a statement'. But Percy wasn't exactly rebelling. He used to be in middle school, but ever since Gabe had left their family, Percy was rather well-behaved. Still, it was strange. Last month, Percy had suddenly showed up with that black leather coat and now Sally was holding a black hoodie in her hands as she was in the middle of doing the weekly laundry. She knew that every piece of clothes that Percy owned was blue. Holding the hoodie close to her chest, she decided to confront Percy about this new phase. When she entered Percy's room, her son was still deep asleep. Wearing a slightly too large, black Nightmare Before Christmas shirt that she hadn't known he owned either. Where were those clothes coming from? ""Mh... Nico..."", mumbled Percy in his sleep, a dopey grin on his face as he rolled over. ~*~ The End ~*~ Author's note: Also, let there be a message hidden in plain sight. Because since BoO came out, I got about half a dozen Solangelo requests. That. Will. Never. Happen. Not. Done. By. Me. The only thing Solangelo is good for is to make Percy jealous, as can be seen here. There'll never be more to that in my stories, at least not as long as it doesn't involve a threesome including Percy. Sorry, I just didn't know how else to reach out to all those requesters who don't bother to look at my profile before requesting (where it quite clearly states that I don't accept requests for Solangelo)~ Now happy Halloween tomorrow! ^^"
15,3,72,3-Takara-Phoenix-72.txt,percy-jackson-and-the-olympians,TakaraPhoenix,"my love"", whispered Nico, hands wandering down Percy's body. Percy nodded his head wildly as Nico cupped his dick and balls. The black dragon smirked as he rolled Percy's balls in his hands slowly, teasingly. His lips captured Percy's and by the time his hand slipped further down. He circled Percy's hole teasingly, enjoying its soft texture. Percy mewled and pushed down against the fingers. They easily slipped into the tight, slippery hole, making Percy sigh pleased. Nico hummed in agreement, latching onto Percy's neck. He kissed and bit down on it, puncturing the skin just the slightest bit, enough to make Percy wince. ""You're supposed to fuck me, not to eat me"", argued Percy with a glare. ""I'm also supposed to mark you, my love"", chuckled Nico amused, sinking his teeth in deeper. To distract Percy, Nico added two more fingers, pushing them in deep and spreading them to stretch Percy properly. The distraction worked fine, because Percy was more busy moaning than wincing. His other hand slowly wrapped around Percy's cock to massage it. Nico startled a little as Percy's tail curled around Nico's ankle, holding him in place. ""You're cute"", grinned Nico, even more amused by that. Percy glared a little at him, grinding down on Nico's fingers. ""Cute enough for you to fuck me?"" ""Definitely"", hummed Nico and slowly pulled his fingers out. He was so rock-hard just from the picture of Percy sprawled out beneath him. His little human had already been enchanting as a real human, but now that he was a hybrid? Breathtaking, really. Lining up with Percy's slick hole, Nico slowly pushed in. Nico thought it truly could only be magic that Percy fit him so perfectly – warm, tight, squeezing down around him in just the right way. ""Bite me"", ordered Percy, arms finding their way around Nico's neck. ""Oh god, I want you to bite me. I need you to mark me, please. Y—You feel so good inside of me!"" ""And you... you feel so, so good chocking my cock like that"", murmured Nico in a praising manner, nibbling Percy's neck. ""So perfect, my little mate. Gonna open you up wide with my dick, fill you up with my cum until you'll carry our offsprings. We're gonna make such gorgeous little dragons."" Percy breath hitched for a second and his eyes widened nearly comically. For a split-second Nico thought that the reality of being a dragon's mate had just caught up with him and was too much. ""...We are, aren't we?"", whispered Percy in awe. ""Between you, my gorgeous black dragon, and my new awesome blue dragon form, our babies are going to be ridiculously pretty..."" Nico blinked before he smiled fondly. The thought urged him on to go faster. Within minutes, they were fucking so hard, if Nico owned a bed it would have broken already. The base of Nico's cock slowly swelled on with his approaching orgasm – it had been so many decades since he last had some kind of sex. And sex with Percy was now officially his new favorite thing. The sounds spilling from Percy's lips, those flushed cheeks, sweat glistening on his sun-kissed skin and running over the occasional patch of blue scales. Nico leaned down, allowing his tongue to follow the same path. He licked down from Percy's pulse over his chest, kissing his lover's perky nipples before licking back down. Before his knot could fully fill out, he thrust harder to force his swelling knot through the tight ring of muscles. Percy made a wanton sound as it slipped in. The moment Nico came, he sank his teeth fully into Percy's neck, tasting the metallic blood on his tongue. ""Mine"", growled Nico possessively as he rode out his orgasm locked onto his mate. ""Y—Yours"", confirmed Percy with a gasp, coming without even really noticing. The feeling of Nico's knot stretching him out and Nico's cum filling him up and Nico's bite claiming him, it all made him come harder than ever before. Percy had Nico in a vice-grip, refusing to let go of his mate. Nico made soft sounds to calm him down, kissing him tenderly. After a little while, Percy was calmed enough to allow Nico to cuddle up to him. ""But if you expect me to be a house-dragon who's going to tend to the little ones and keep the cave clean, I will personally burn you to a crisp"", warned Percy pointedly. ""My love"", whispered Nico and kissed Percy behind the ear. ""I chose you because you're a hero and knight. We started patrolling your kingdom three days ago to keep your humans safe and I don't expect you to stop doing it. I will support you and keep your kingdom safe with you. I will also keep you safe and our younglings and I do expect you to do the same. Be a hero, but don't be reckless, my love. I would never be able to endure losing you."" Percy heaved a sigh. Nico was being literal; if Percy died, so would Nico. They were now sharing a heart, a life. Percy would never risk his lover's life, or their children's. And Nico was right, the black dragon had so far helped Percy watch over Atlantis, because Nico knew how much it meant to Percy. Being a hybrid now, Percy would never be able to return to the castle, so he had to at the very least make sure from afar that his family and people would be protected. ""I love you, my big bad dragon"", whispered Percy with a happy grin, kissing Nico's neck. ""And I love you, my heroic little knight"", grinned Nico pleased. He had his arms wrapped tightly around Percy's waist, holding him safe and close, relishing in the warmth of his mate. This was all Nico had longed for for centuries. He closed his eyes and he could hear their hearts beating in the same rhythm, beating as one. ~*~ The End ~*~"

""Stop being disgustingly cute and sit down"", called Hazel out. The five of them used the time that the dogs were playing with each other to eat their lunch. Half-way through it, Percy noticed that the dogs were back to sniffing him and Nico kept staring at him. Right now, he wished that aside from fish and horses, he'd also understand underworld-creatures, but that was something reserved to children of Hades. "" Why does prince's mate smell like he wants pups? "", asked Zerberus confused, nudging Percy. "" Because master is a child of the sea. Master can have pups and now that master and his mate spend so much time together, master is getting ready for breeding "", replied Mrs. O'Leary. Nico choked on his coke and stared wide-eyed at Percy. Percy tilted his head confused. ""Uhm, guys, if you'd excuse us. I think Percy and I'll take the dogs for a walk"", grunted Nico. Hazel frowned confused as she stared after her brother who hastily pulled Percy along and away from them. Something was weird here. She was also a little displeased that Nico and Percy left her and Frank alone with Leo. Not that she disliked being with Leo, but he was complicated. ""So... how are things going with Calypso?"", pressed Frank out between clenched teeth. He didn't want to ask. Didn't want to know. But he might as well get it over with, since at one point they'd have to be polite enough to ask about the stupid, stupid, stupid girlfriend. ""Great"", grinned Leo broadly. ""Rachel, Annabeth and Piper are actually on a road-trip with her at the moment. She's really getting used to our modern time and all. I thought it would be harder."" ""Why didn't you go with them?"", asked Hazel surprised. ""I'm not her babysitter"", said Leo confused. ""I mean, she has other friends aside from me too, so she doesn't need me to hover by all the time. I already got on her nerves on the island, I guess me being around all the time reminds her of that. She has a whole world waiting for her to discover."" ""True enough. A little distance doesn't hurt in a relationship either"", nodded Frank slowly. ""Relationship?"", repeated Leo stunned. ""You think Cally and I are in a relationship? We're just friends. She's bossy and mean and honestly, by now I have enough self-esteem to know that I deserve someone who treats me good. I mean, we kinda work as friends, but I don't need a girlfriend who degrades me all the time and insults me. I'm not like Percy who fell for Annabeth after the thousandth 'seaweed brain' and hours of bickering. Piper beat it into my head, I need to stop being into girls who treat me like crap and start looking for someone... nice."" ""He's not with Calypso"", stated Frank, nudging Hazel while staring at Leo. ""Uhm, I just said that"", nodded Leo confused. ""He was talking to me"", laughed Hazel and scooted closer to the Latino. So did Frank, from the other side. After a little while, Leo found himself sandwiched between the couple, his thighs touching theirs. Blushing a little, he chewed on his sandwich restlessly. ""Is... there something wrong, guys?"", asked Leo unsure, looking from one to the other. ""I know we weren't always the nicest to you and we're sorry and I really hope we don't go into the 'not nice enough' category anymore, because if so, I'm going to kiss you now"", answered Hazel. ""Okay..."", nodded Leo slowly, gulping. ""I mean, yeah, you're nice. I know why you two were acting weird around me at first, but we're friends now, right? I... like you a lot."" ""Then I'm going to kiss you now"", smiled Hazel and leaned over. /break\ ""Okay, what's up with you?"", grunted Percy, a little freaked out after a while. Mrs. O'Leary and Zerberus were running around wildly and Nico was just silently staring at him. ""Sorry. I didn't mean to freak you out, Perce. It's just... Molly and Zerberus said that you're... uhm... getting ready for... breeding? Because you can have... pups."" ""Well, they have good noses, so I guess they can smell my hormones"", mumbled Percy embarrassed and blushed brightly. ""That's not how I wanted to tell you that we really need contraception when we have sex, because... well, I can get pregnant. It's a Poseidon-thing."" ""That's... interesting"", nodded Nico slowly. ""You're freaking out, right?"", groaned Percy, hiding his face between his hands. ""Actually, no"", chuckled Nico amused. ""No?"", grunted Percy surprised and peaked out from between his fingers. ""No"", confirmed Nico and stopped, taking Percy's hand. ""You talk to fish and can walk over water. Why should it freak me out that you can get pregnant, Perce? It just means we have to use protection until we want children. I mean, if that's something you'd want, of course."" ""Let's take it one step after the other, Nick"", suggested Percy and leaned in to kiss Nico. Nico smiled into the kiss, one hand in Percy's neck. ""Okay. So... should we return to the others?"" ""No. I told Leo very seriously today that if Hazel and Frank don't get it right soon, he has to seduce them. So I really hope he's using this opportunity to do some seducing"", declined Percy with a grin. ""Why would he do that?"", asked Nico, honestly surprised. ""What about Calypso?"" ""I don't know"", shrugged Percy confused. ""She's discovering the female form these days. Thousands of years and she only got to see guys. As far as I know, she's currently dating Drew."" ""Drew?"", repeated Nico stunned and nodded. ""Okay. Then we better take a long walk. To be safe."" Percy didn't understand, but he was fine with that. Their fingers were linked as they followed the two underworld-dogs. A soft smile was laying on Percy's lips. This was perfection. ~*~ The End ~*~"

Frowning annoyed, Nico reached down to pinch Percy's ass. ""Ouch"", huffed Percy, hitting Nico's chest. ""Scratch that, you two are just disgusting!"", corrected Alabaster loudly. ""Don't be such a jerk, man"", chuckled Frank from where he stood at the table with the food. ""Yeah, I think they're like the perfect couple"", agreed Leo, sitting perched up on the table. ""...What do you two want?"", asked Nico suspiciously. ""What makes you think that?"", asked Leo innocently. ""We're just being supportive."" ""Yeah, no, you two teaming up to defend me can only mean you want something"", snorted Nico. ""You said you're gonna go to New Orleans visiting Hazel next week and I really miss her. Haven't seen her since last year"", admitted Frank with a blush. ""And I kinda told Leo so much about her that he got curious. I just know she'd get along great with Leo."" ""Fine, fine. You two can come with us to New Orleans"", sighed Nico. ""...That was easier than you said"", pointed Leo out with a frown. ""What can I say, Frank is probably right. Hazel would like you. You kind of remind me of her ex-boyfriend Sammy. And with you and Frank over, you could occupy her time long enough so I can get some alone time with Percy too. I want to show him the city in a more... romantic way"", stated Nico simply, shrugging. ""I mean, I am looking forward to seeing my little cousin again, but I also want to enjoy the vacation with my... fiance too."" ""Say that again"", requested Percy with a dopey grin. Nico snorted and rolled his eyes. ""Fiance."" ""Loving the sound of that"", hummed Percy and leaned up to kiss Nico. ""Wait. Is that also why you planned that mini vacation for you and me? So we can tell your cousin about the engagement?"" ""...Perhaps"", admitted Nico slowly, blushing a little. ""But I also miss her. I haven't seen her in months now. I hate when that much time comes between her and me. She's like a sister to me."" ""You're the cutest thing on this planet"", whispered Percy, kissing Nico's nose. ""Says the cuddly oversized seal snuggled up against me"", countered Nico amused. ""You're both disgustingly cute"", stated Alabaster and rolled his eyes. ""Didn't you listen?"" ""At this point, I have to agree with Ally"", said Ethan seriously. ""I mean, I know from experience that Percy is a cuddle-monster but he's even worse with you than he ever was with me..."" ""What can I say? Nico brings out the best in me"", grinned Percy teasingly. /Their First Vacation\ Frank was more right than anticipated, noted Nico as he watched how Frank, Hazel and Leo sat together in her back-yard, huddled suspiciously close and sharing a bottle of wine. Nico and Percy had been out for a couple hours and Hazel didn't seem like she had even noticed. Sure, she hugged the life out of both Percy and Nico, especially when she saw the ring, but then she met Leo. Her and Frank, they had been dancing around dating for years now. And she was instantly smitten with the cute Latino, just like Frank had been. Nico rolled his eyes at them. ""Hey, guys. Got some wine left over for me and Nico, or is this an exclusive date?"", asked Percy. ""D—Date?"", sputtered Leo wide-eyed and flushed. Percy frowned confused and looked at Frank and Hazel. ""I thought, judging from the family pictures of Nico, Hazel, Frank, Jason and Reyna, that you two are in a long-distance relationship. In a polyamorous one, because... aren't you two dating now , Frank and Leo? I... thought the reason you two wanted to come here was to, uh, you know, do the three-way thing?"" ""Percy, amore, I love you, but you are not good with your words"", snorted Nico amused. ""I—I... we are not dating"", stammered Frank embarrassed, face red. ""Neither of us."" ""Yeah, because you never had the guts to ask me out"", sighed Hazel pointedly. ""You too?"", asked Leo wide-eyed. ""I thought that it was all me!"" ""Oh, sweetie, it sure ain't you. You're adorable"", assured Hazel with a smile. ""It's all Frank."" ""A—Adorable?"", echoed Leo with a bright blush. ""Yes. I'm very grateful Nico brought the eye-candy for me"", grinned Hazel and winked. ""...Oh"", mumbled Frank, faltering a little. ""I meant you too, silly"", laughed Hazel, hitting Frank's shoulder. ""O—Oh"", hummed Frank, face beet-red. Percy grinned at them from where he had his chin resting on Nico's shoulder. ""On second thought, I'm really tired from touring New Orleans. Come, Nick, let's go upstairs to our room."" ""You are so good at this, you should have become an actor"", called Hazel out, rolling her eyes. ""Have I mentioned that I really like your cousin?"", laughed Percy, steering Nico toward the stairs. ""Have fun, you three! Lots and lots of fun! Nico and I are really heavy sleepers!"" ""Actor, Jackson, really, you should become one"", called Hazel after them fondly. Percy giggled as he pushed Nico forward toward their bedroom. Once inside, they shed most of their clothes and curled together on the bed. Nico got his tablet out to work some on his graphic novel, another reason why he had wanted to come to New Orleans because the next issue was supposed to take place here. Percy rested his chin on Nico's thigh, watching curiously. ""When I came back to New York, I thought... I'd never manage to piece my life back together"", whispered Percy softly. ""That I'd never have the perfect life like they did in the movies and shows. But... then I met you. And our life? It's even better, because it's real. Because we are real."" ""You're right"", admitted Nico softly, caressing Percy's hair. ""You gave my life a better twist than I could have ever written for my stories. You're better than anything I could ever write."" ~*~ The End ~*~"

""Sounds to me more as though all your swimmers are going to complain how their coach is only drooling over their new Italian teacher"", countered Annabeth with one cocked eyebrow. ""He has this whole hot accent going on. You know how weak that makes me"", whined Percy. ""Why yes, I do recall making you drool quite a lot when we first met"", nodded Octavian, laying heavy on his British accent. ""Why ever did we not work out, exactly?"" ""Because I wanted to settle down, have a family and a little house with a white fence while all you wanted was your fun"", hummed Percy and turned around. ""Anyway, I should get going..."" He didn't particularly enjoy talking about his past relationship with Octavian. Especially not with Octavian. That was the downside of dating co-workers. When it didn't work out, it could make everything just a bit too awkward. He was lucky that him and Octavian still got along relatively well, though he guessed he had to thank Luke for that. Because at first, Octavian had been quite bitter about the break-up and only sleeping with Luke had brought him back on tracks. His feet carried him to the garage, where Beckendorf and Leo were working. Beckendorf was a mechanic and owner of Hephaestus' Garage, but to earn some extra cash, he was also a part-time teacher, Leo his apprentice from his garage had been more than eager to also help out at the school. Which was a good idea considering how dangerous the combination of idiotic teenagers and blowtorches was. ""Hey, you guys. What are you working on?"", asked Percy interested as he walked over to their work bench. ""Anything interesting? Or are you perhaps maybe free to take a look at my car?"" ""Seriously?"", asked Leo as he pushed out from under a car. ""Dude, this is like the second time this school year that your car broke down and it's only the third day of the semester."" ""What can I say? She's not the youngest"", huffed Percy with a desperate shrug. ""Sometimes, it's better to invest in a new car instead of patching the old girl back together"", advised Beckendorf, who was leaning over a bunch of blue-prints. ""Let her rest in peace, Perce."" ""Right. If one could effort that new car"", snorted Percy and rolled his eyes. /break\ Nico took an interested look around the teacher's lounge. There was a broad dark-skinned man, his clothes dirty with grease, as he talked to a very excited and very gorgeous woman. ""Those are Beckendorf and Silena, his fiance. She's the coach of the cheerleaders and he's our local mechanics teacher"", explained a voice from behind him, startling him a little. When Nico turned around, he came face to face with the beautiful, green-eyed man. ""Ciao, bello."" [trans: Hello, beauty ] ""Let me introduce you!"", grinned Percy, waving his arms around. ""Guys, this our new guy! Nico di Angelo. The new Italian teacher. Nico, as I just said, those are Beckendorf and Silena. Then there is Jason, the football coach and Clarisse, the basketball coach. All others are scattered or in class right now, I guess. Why don't you join me and my fellow coaches for lunch?"" ""I would love to, carino"", nodded Nico with one of his enchanting smirks. Percy bit his lips to keep from sighing. He sat down between Silena and Clarisse, who both nodded at them shortly. Clarisse was in the middle of making plans for her team while Silena most likely was currently telling her fiance about the newbies. She was always very animated when it came to her cheerleaders. But as soon as Nico and Percy joined them, she went silent. ""Oh wow, you are... hah..."", sighed Silena dreamily, looking Nico up and down. ""I can already see you posing for Rachel's art class. The students surely would have something to drool over."" ""Silena, love. Stop making the new guy uncomfortable"", grunted Beckendorf amused. ""Ah, it's alright"", offered Nico with a smile. ""I enjoy compliments from beautiful women."" Silena giggled and blushed a little, batting her eyelashes at him. ""So charming... You surely will break many teen-girls' hearts this school year. So, tell us a little more about you!"" /break\ Nico taught his first class that afternoon. And just as he stepped up to the board to write his name on it, he caught sight of his classroom's view. The swimming pool. Where Percy was currently teaching a class. He may have drifted off with his thoughts as he just stood there and watched the other. Yes, he liked this room and its view. One of his students had to call him back to reality though. /break\ That night, as Nico arrived back in his hotel room, he felt just a little empty. His new colleagues were very sweet. Clarisse was a little rough, but he got along with Jason quite well and Silena was rather amusing too. But his personal favorite surely was the swimming coach. He had to admit that the young man with the mesmerizing eyes was far more than just nice company. He was beautiful. Yawning widely, he collapsed face-first on the bed, not bothering with undressing himself. He had been awake the whole night and just finished his first day of school. By now, he was far too tired to care. Hopefully, the pretty one would have classes tomorrow too so Nico could enjoy the view. Author's note: I feel as though FFNet is being flooded by Percico these days. It needs more Nicercy. So you're getting more Nicercy. Next chapter will have our still homeless Nico getting an offer he can not refuse - to move in with Percy (and Annabeth, but really, what does Nico care about that?). Also, we'll see a little bit of Leo who is stuck between a hard place (aka Hazel) and a rock (aka Frank)!"
19,3,82,3-Takara-Phoenix-82.txt,percy-jackson-and-the-olympians,TakaraPhoenix,"two who were at least a head or two taller than Percy and all three of them about twice as broad as Percy – laughed at that. When Nico saw something sparkling in the hand of one of the guys, he hissed. A knife. The light of a passing car on the main street reflected on the weapon. ""We got a message for Hades di Angelo"", snickered the shortest of the three. ""Really? Just let me get a pen and I'll note it down for you"", offered Percy with a smile. Oh, that beautiful naive sweet gentle Percy. Nico wanted to pull him down and hide him from the world. And then, the next second, the knife clattered onto the ground as Percy easily kicked it out of the thug's hand. The guy grunted in surprise and the other two lunged at Percy. Percy dodged them elegantly, before kicking the legs down from underneath one of them, making him collapse. Nico's mouth hung open as he stared wide-eyed at the fight unfolding in front of him. Percy was precise and graceful as he methodically fought off three bulky, physically imposing attackers and took them out one by one until they were all knocked out and laying in a heap on the ground. Percy stood up straight and dusted off his jeans before getting his phone out. ""Thany, I got a bit of a situation here. Back alley behind the cinema. I'll leave the... garbage here for you to take it out and bring the goods home safely. Yeah"", said Percy professionally. After he hung up, he went to check on Nico, concern written all over his face. All Nico could do was gape at Percy. This display of physical strength, of strategy. Nico was painfully hard. ""Are you alright, Nico? I know I had them pretty much under control, but..."", drawled Percy worried. ""You look rather out of it. Did one somehow hurt you? Are you hurt?"" ""Fuck, that was hot"", grunted Nico, voice dark as he grabbed Percy and pulled him into a kiss. Percy made a surprised sound as he was now the one pinned against a wall, Nico pressing up against him to let him feel just how hot Nico found it. Percy grinned just a little as he ground against Nico's half-hard cock, fingers looping into the Italian's pants. ""Okay. How about we move this to our apartment, babe?"", asked Percy amused. Nico nodded sharply. All he could think of was that his tame little kitten had just taken out three guys like it was nothing and didn't even seem breathless. This had most definitely been the hottest thing Nico had ever seen. The two made their way over to their apartment in record time and as soon as the door was closed, Percy was pressed against it and Nico was practically ripping the clothes off Percy, pawing at the former SEAL's six-pack, lips eagerly tracing fresh bruises and cuts from the fight, placing gentle soothing kisses on them. Percy groaned as he tried to maneuver them to the bed, but they only made it to the couch, where Percy just fell backward as Nico pushed him. ""You. Were. So. Hot"", growled Nico as he stripped down. ""Shit. The way you moved. So precise and... like... deadly. So strong . So elegant. So... overpowering. Fuck."" ""Okay. If that's how you get when seeing me fight, I think I really want you to sit in on my training sessions with the guys"", chuckled Percy amused as he spread his legs in invitation. Nico groaned darkly at the mere idea of getting a regular show of that. He grabbed the lube they kept on the stand next to the couch because they often didn't manage to make it to bed. He generously lubed up his cock and then sat down between Percy's legs, his lube-covered hand finding Percy's hole that twitched eagerly at the touch. Percy willingly wrapped his strong legs – legs that had literally just strangled a guy – around Nico's waist, thrusting up while Nico prepped him. Nico didn't have much patience tonight and his own arousal seemed to also leave Percy impatient and eager, because the bodyguard urged him on to get going. Nico gladly obeyed, thrusting hard and sharp in one go, earning him a strangled moan from Percy. Percy's nails scratched down Nico's back as the Italian started fucking him hard and fast. ""S—Shit, you're so hot "", groaned Nico darkly, kissing and biting Percy's neck. ""What you did to protect me. How you fought . I didn't think... Fuck."" Percy was mainly amused and he was also definitely enjoying his lover's passion. With Nico's constant flow of praising words of adoration and amazement did Percy soon come into the hand jerking him off. Percy gasped breathlessly as he collapsed against the couch, adrenaline from the fight and the fuck slowly draining from him as he watched Nico work himself into his orgasm too. Nico soon came too, spilling deep inside his lover before he collapsed on top of Percy. Percy made a little sound at that, nudging Nico over so they were laying next to each other, allowing Percy to curl up half on top of Nico, seeking out his boyfriend's warmth. ""You're incredible. I'm sorry I ever doubted your skills"", panted Nico. ""Oh. You can make up for it with sex"", assured Percy amused, pecking Nico's lips. ""And cuddles."" Nico snorted as he wrapped his arms possessively around Percy's waist to pull him even closer so he could rest his chin on Percy's hair. This amazing creature in his arms had just taken out three armed thugs with his bare hands, all to protect Nico. And now he was curled against Nico like a docile little house-cat. Even though Nico had just finally seen the ferocious tiger behind the kitten. ""I love you, kitten"", whispered Nico gently. ""I love you and I'm grateful to have you."" ~*~ The End ~*~"

""Scorpius –"" His lips drowned out my words. For a moment, I wanted to kiss him back. For a moment, I wanted to forget that we were standing in the middle of Honeydukes, surrounded by the other students. But that was before the bitter sting of betrayal set in. Scorpius drew back from the kiss slightly, bringing a hand up to frame my face before closing the space between us again. He had yet to realise that I wasn't kissing him back. I pushed him away from me roughly. Scorpius stumbled on his feet, watching me with wide eyes. It was obvious that I had caught him off guard. ""I can't believe you,"" I said quietly before he could attempt to close the space between us. ""You were still trying to get into my pants? Is that what this was? Talking to me about your mum, listening to me when I talked about how hard my parent's divorce was for me? A way for you to get my walls down so you could achieve your goal?"" He shook his head, ""Of course it's not –"" ""Merlin, you're just like everyone said you were."" Swallowing thickly, I straightened to my full height and stepped away from him to put more distance between us. I paid him no heed as he called my name, trying to talk to me, and turned on my heels to walk out of the shop. So, maybe I was being childish by avoiding him. But who was Albus to decide that I needed to talk to Scorpius again. And, for that matter, when did he decide that Scorpius and I should be something more than strangers? Talk about switching sides. ""Will you just listen to me?"" Albus implored, clearly becoming exasperated. ""Of course I'm listening to you Albus."" I couldn't help but roll my eyes. ""You abducted me from the common room and forced me into your dorm so I've got nothing else to do but listen to you."" ""Your snark isn't appreciated."" He informed me with a sniff of his nose. ""Besides, if you were really listening to me, then you would understand what I'm saying."" ""You're saying that you want me to talk to Scorpius."" I crossed my legs, making myself comfortable on his bed, ""And I'm saying I don't want to. Anyway, I thought you were against Scorpius and me being friends?"" ""I was in the beginning,"" he admitted, sitting down on the bed beside me. ""And you're not anymore? Why?"" ""Because we have a long talk."" Albus patted my knee, ""And because you're different for him, different from the other girls."" ""Well I thought I was too,"" I muttered looking away from him, ""But I was clearly wrong."" ""You are different,"" a voice insisted from the doorway and I shot Albus an annoyed look from the corner of my eye. ""You lied to me."" ""I just omitted a fact,"" he denied innocently as he rose to his feet. ""I'll leave you two alone."" I didn't watch Albus as he left the room, eyeing the spot where he had been sitting in annoyance. He had tricked me. Merlin. ""Well,"" I muttered, forcing myself to look over at Scorpius who had made his way across the room to sit on his own bed. ""Let's get this over with then."" ""There was a misunderstanding in Honeydukes,"" he insisted and I couldn't help but roll my eyes. ""Of course there was."" ""There was,"" Scorpius asserted, ""And you ran off before I could explain. Besides, any time I tried to talk to you about it, you avoided me like I was the plague."" ""And you're surprised about that, because?"" He sighed wearily, realising that I wasn't budging. Rubbing a hand over his face, he looked up at me slowly. I could tell that Scorpius was nervous, but why – ""Listen, I'm only going to say this once because I don't have the courage to say it more times."" He looked away from me, fiddling with his fingers. ""I don't do relationships, everyone knows that –"" ""And that's supposed to justify tricking me?"" ""Would you let me finish?"" Annoyance crept into his tone. ""Merlin, woman, you could write a book on the conclusions you jump to by yourself. Look , I'm going to be frank here. When Albus told me to not even think about going after you, it made you off limits and something you're not allowed to have is much more tempting then something you can't have. I didn't want to be in a relationship until I met you –"" ""Merlin, how cliché."" Even still, I could hear the truth in his words He narrowed his eyes at me, ""Maybe, but it's the truth."" ""I don't doubt that,"" I said, my words making him look at me in utter shock. He floundered for something to say for a moment before shaking his head in exasperation, ""Ok, I think I'm going to get whiplash from tying to keep up with your emotions, could you please explain?"" I couldn't help but smile as I sat up properly on Albus' bed, moving to the edge so my knees brushed against his. ""I see you Scorpius."" ""I still don't –"" ""I mean it, I see you, I see past the façade you put up and I hear the honesty in your voice."" ""Then why didn't you let me explain."" ""I needed to hear you say the words,"" I admitted, letting him hold my hand. ""Only once I'd heard them could I be certain."" ""But you kept running –"" I smiled slightly sheepishly, ""I was scared that you'd tell me that it had all been a ploy."" He shook his head, but still he couldn't keep a smile off his face. ""How is it you can see through me so well?"" he marvelled quietly. ""I'm not sure,"" I admitted, ""But I'm glad I can."""

Albus asked in blatant concern as we stepped into the common room. ""You're being really quiet, are you sure you don't want to see the nurse."" I shook my head, smiling reassuringly at him. ""I'm fine Albus."" ""I can take you there myself."" Of for the love of – ""Albus,"" I said with a sigh as we came to a stop in the middle of the common room. ""Go on,"" he encouraged. ""I have this friend,"" I started cautiously, watching his expression flicker slightly. ""And my friend has a crush on one of their friends. Now this friend, she comes from a big extended family and because she didn't want to endanger the relationship she had with her guy best friend, she asked her family members for advice. But her family members gave her bad advice – advice she didn't realise was bad – and her guy friend is growing kind of sick of it. Why can't she just act like she normally does?"" ""What?"" He asked quietly, after a moment's silence. He went rigid, closing himself off from me. ""Never mind,"" I said with a shake of my head. Taking my bag from him, I slung it over my shoulder. ""Wait a minute –"" ""Goodnight Albus,"" I said quietly, leaving him standing in the common room and heading up to my dorm. Since our rather one sided conversation in the common room, Albus had reverted to normal. He was acting like himself but he seemed more distant in a way that was slightly unnerving. He wasn't distant in a way that was noticeable by others; he didn't sit in the furthest seat away from me, he didn't go out of his way to avoid sitting next to me in class and he didn't stop talking to me. He did none of that. He was distant in small ways, in ways that counted. When we sat together he went to extra lengths to not touch me and that stunned me because, just the feeling of his thigh pressed against mine was so comforting. There was no casual arm around my shoulder as he laughed at something I said, there was no random holding my hand and there were no warm smiles that said everything that his lips were yet to say. ""Hey,"" Albus said, rising to his feet as we sat in the common room. I looked up at him, watching as he held out his hand for me to talk. Glancing behind him to meet Scorpius' eyes, I raised an eyebrow and all he did in response was gesture for me to take the extended hand. ""Can we talk?"" ""Of course we can,"" I said softly, slipping my hand into his and rose to my feet. I let him lead me up the stairs to the boys' dorm and when we were in his dorm, I walked towards the bed that I knew was his. Perching on the edge of the bed, I waited for him to say something. Albus fidgeted in front of the now closed door and I sighed. I hated that things were this awkward between us now. ""What did you want to talk about?"" I asked eventually. ""You knew,"" Albus said, not accusingly as he approached the bed, ""You knew what I was doing and why I was doing it."" ""I did."" I kept my eyes on his, waiting for him to progress. ""Why didn't you say anything?"" He sat down beside him, thigh brushing against mine. ""Merlin, why didn't you say anything instead of letting me carry on like that? Not that you'll think of it this way, but what you did was cruel – to make me think that I stood a chance when –"" ""What are you talking about?"" My incredulous tone carried across to him, making him trail off. Albus swallowed nervously but met my gaze head on. ""If you knew what I was doing and you didn't return my feelings, you should have told me that. That way I'd have spared myself from stupidly raising my hopes up."" ""That's not it at all."" My eyebrows rose when I realised that he really believed it to be true. ""How could you think that Albus? Merlin's beard, you know me Albus, why would I do something so hurtful?"" I rose to my feet, pacing back and forth in front of him. ""How could you possibly have it so wrong? I was waiting, Al. I was waiting for you to stop pretending to be someone you're not and to start acting like yourself, so I could –"" He took a hold of my wrist suddenly, stopping me mid-step. I looked at him curiously, finding him rising to his feet. ""So you could what? ""So I could say yes,"" I said quietly, looking up into his eyes. He showed no outward reaction to my words. But I knew Albus; his mind was probably running right now. Dropping my wrist, he took a small step back and asked hesitantly, ""You would?"" I nodded, reaching out to take his hand. ""I would."" He interlinked our fingers then, smiling shyly down at our hands. ""I've wasted a lot of time by doing this, haven't I?"" ""You have."" He groaned aloud suddenly, dropping my hand to take two fistfuls of his hair. I watched him cautiously, mouth parting when he tugged at his hair. ""Albus."" I put my hands on his arms, trying to get him to stop. ""What the hell are you doing?"" He dropped his arms and said despairingly, ""I should have just listened to Teddy. He's the one that said to just ask you out without follow any of the other's advice. If I had just listened to him then we'd already be dating by now!"" ""There was a reason he was chosen to be head boy, Al."""

I furrowed my eyebrows, ""I don't understand – you've got a day off tomorrow so why come around here. What's it going to take for you to stop spending all of your time here?"" ""Well that's a rather straightforward question,"" he murmured, closing the distance between us. I suddenly lost the ability to speak when he stopped right in front of me, the front of our shoes brushing against each other. Leaning down to bring his face in level with mine, he tilted his head curiously, ""I wonder whether you really want to know."" ""Of course I do,"" I murmured quietly, having finally found my voice. ""But will you grant me it?"" he continued just as quietly as before, raising an eyebrow when I nodded straight away. ""Promise?"" ""I promise, now what is it?"" ""A date."" He grinned suddenly when I went to protest, ""You promised Robinson. I'll pick you up on Friday at 7, be ready."" ""Wait –"" He pressed a quick kiss to my cheek, silencing me before straightening up. Without another word, Fred made his way towards the door, humming a tune under his breath as he went. Turning the closed sign back to open, Fred left the bakery with a smile and left me staring at the door he had just walked out of. This was not a date and if he thought that this was a date then he was seriously confused. Who the hell brought their date to their mother's house? And I hadn't even consented to this! He had shown up at the bakery, right on time, and had apparated me away before I could even begin to protest. It was rather annoying. I hadn't recognised the house we had apparated outside of, because why should I have? It wasn't as if I had ever visited the Burrow before. Only when an all too familiar woman opened the door, did I realise where I was and I was ushered into the house before I could say another word. And if that wasn't bad enough, it seemed that the entire family had decided to visit their parents at once. Or, as I was later informed by George, this was the weekly meal that the Weasley family made sure to keep to and I had been brought along as Fred's date. ""Merlin Fred,"" I exclaimed quietly, pulling him into a corner of the room to get some privacy – which appeared to be an impossible task. ""Who the hell brings a girl to meet their parents on their first date?"" ""Because you've referred to this as our first date and not our only date, I take it that there'll be more?"" He chuckled at the sight of my glare and looped an arm over my shoulder, shaking me slightly. ""Besides, you'd have had to meet them anyway, love. There's no way I'm letting you run away again."" ""Fred –"" ""This way I'll know whether you're strong enough to eventually become a Weasley."" He said the words so casually that they actually stumped me. ""Surely you're joking. Right?"" ""I don't see what the big deal is."" He shrugged and I struggled not to thump him when I realised that he hadn't answered my question. ""You've met most of my family before and they like you. I thought you liked them too."" ""I do,"" I said with a sigh, glancing away from him when I realised that we had rapidly become the centre of attention. Merlin, why were they all so nosy? ""But –"" ""You're nervous,"" he correctly guessed, squeezing my shoulder. ""Well, there's no reason for you to be nervous."" ""That's easy for you to say,"" I muttered under my breath, shooting him a look when he had the nerve to start chuckling. ""You're not the one meeting the entire family and, in case you didn't notice, you happen to have a rather large family."" ""I'd have to be blind to not notice that."" I said nothing else. Instead, my eyes focused onto the woman who had made her way out of the kitchen and had scanned the room. Once her eyes had locked onto my figure, Mrs Weasley gestured for me to follow after her and I felt my heart drop into my stomach. And I thought I was nervous before – Throwing Fred one last look, I frowned when he had the cheek to throw me a thumbs up as I followed after his mother. Walking across the room, avoiding each of the Weasley family members' eyes as I did so, I headed into the kitchen and waited for Mrs Weasley to say something. She was standing in the open doorway and from my position I could see Fred who wriggled his eyebrows at me. ""How long have you been dating Fred, my dear?"" she asked, straight to the point. ""Excuse me?"" I looked around the kitchen, unable to meet the older woman's eyes. ""Not long – not long at all."" She nodded as if she had expected that and made her way over to me. Taking both of my hands in hers, she met my eyes with a gentle smile. ""He told me you saved his life – during the Battle, is that true?"" ""It was a simple spell,"" I protested quietly, wondering why the older woman's eyes were filling with tears; had I said something wrong? She embraced me quickly, making my eyes widen. I returned her embrace when she began to sob loudly into my shoulder. Patting her back gently, I gave Fred a look, silently telling him to come and sort out his mother. He did no such thing, instead he chuckled and ignored George who had come up to talk to him. ""Thank you,"" Mrs Weasley said sincerely, sniffling slightly. Pulling back from me, she held my shoulders and said with a smile, ""Welcome to the family."" I stared back at her silently; what had I gotten myself into?"
23,0,41,0-everlovingdeer-41.txt,harry-potter,everlovingdeer,"anything on me. So can I go now?"" He remained silent, an amused smirk tugging at his lips as he nodded. Making my way to the portrait hole I paused at the sound of Abraxus' voice. ""You're smitten Tom,"" he remarked. ""She's got you wrapped around her finger."" ""And what's so bad about that?"" Tom asked in his normally haughty voice. Once I was outside of the heads dorm I chewed on the inside of my cheek. It was obvious that I had completed my mission and now I just had to do the hardest part. I needed to return home. With a deep sigh I touched my hand to the time turner that was hiding beneath my shirt. I pushed the thought from my mind as I completed my rounds. When I was done I found myself standing outside of Dumbledore's office. Knocking on the door I waited for him to call me in. ""Come in, come in."" Entering the office I sat down in one of the chairs in front of his desk, fiddling with the hem of my skirt. ""What is it my dear?"" ""Professor,"" I began quietly, raising my eyes up to meet his. ""I – I think it's time I went back."" Dumbledore watched me contemplatively, ""Do you want to go back Miss Stevens."" ""Of course I do."" Even I could hear the lie in my voice. ""Of course I want to go home."" ""But it is still home?"" At his question I removed the time turner from around my neck and fiddled with the chain. I couldn't answer his question. Dumbledore stood from his desk and came to stand beside me, setting a hand on my shoulder. ""Can I see that?"" He held out a hand for the time turner. Once it was placed in the centre of his palm Dumbledore waked back around his desk, staring at it. ""It's a remarkable piece of magic, don't you think? It gives one the power to change a magnitude of things."" ""Professor?"" He didn't acknowledge me as he placed the time turner on his desk and pulled his wand from his pocket. ""Reducto!"" The piece of the now broken time turner scattered and I felt my heart plummet. I was stuck here – ""Why did you do that?"" I found myself asking quietly. ""A broken heart can do many things,"" he answered gravely. ""It would be best to not find out what it does to Mr Riddle. Although, now you do have a reason to stay."" After a few moments I excused myself from Dumbledore's office and headed back to my dorm, his words echoing through my mind. The next morning when I sat down for breakfast it felt different because I knew that there was no way for me to go back home. But I didn't think I had a problem with that. I was talking to Melinia when I was interrupted by a tap on my shoulder. Looking over my shoulder I glanced questioningly at the first year standing in front of me. ""Mr Riddle asked for you to meet him in the corridor,"" with that the first year turned and walked away. Melinia, having heard the words, ushered me away quickly and I excused myself from the table. Stepping into the corridor I found Tom waiting against the wall and made my way over to him. When I was standing in front of him he took a hold of my hand and pulled me closer to his. ""I heard that you went to see Dumbledore last night?"" He asked in concern. ""Is everything alright?"" ""Do you have spies watching me or something?"" I narrowed my eyes at him suspiciously but he only smiled innocently. ""But everything's fine."" And it really was. Smiling up at Tom, I rose onto my toes to press a soft kiss to his lips. His surprise was obvious and understandable; I had never initiated a kiss before. It was one of the ways I had tried to restrain myself from growing too attached to him. But I didn't have to worry about that anymore. Tom let go of my hand to press against the small of my back and pull me into him. When we eventually separated from each other, Tom wrapped an arm around my shoulder and led me out of the building, it was the start of the weekend and I didn't want to spend the day cooped up inside. ""Did you decide on what you want to do when you leave school Tom?"" I asked, needing one last piece of proof that I had managed to change him. ""I wanted to teach at Hogwarts; I always have but I don't think I'm experienced enough to."" He squeezed my shoulder. ""But I've been offered a job at the ministry where I can gain the necessary experience."" I smothered a smile by turning into his side; I had changed him. ""So you're not going to work at Borgin and Burkes then?"" ""I had to make sure that whatever job I go into, will allow me the chance to become successful enough to support a family."" ""A family?"" I asked, stopping mid step. He'd never mentioned wanting a family. ""A family,"" he nodded with a smile. ""You, me and a few children. But not for a few years yet – you did say that you wanted to start a career first."" ""I did,"" I agreed, watching him closely. He was looking away from me. Trying to hide how big a deal the words were for him. ""What did you decide to become then?"" ""An auror."" He snapped his head towards me, glaring into my eyes. ""No, there is no way you are going neat any dark wizards."" ""Oh if only you knew,"" I muttered to myself, the irony not lost on me. Tom cleared his throat sharply, obviously having heard my words. ""I'm only joking Tom – I'm planning to become a healer."" Original text Contribute a better translation"

There were rumours of it even being instated as a textbook within the Hogwarts syllabus. But that was still in discussion. His dropping by to my office signalled that he had some news and I knew this time would be no different. Once he had finished for the day, he dropped by my office, letting himself in. I paused midway through packing up and when I realised who it was, I sent him a smile before continuing with my tidying up. ""How was your day?"" I asked, slinging my bag over my shoulder. ""It was busy,"" he said with a slightly tired smile, ""I hadn't realised how many people wanted me to sign their copy of the book. But I managed to get my travel visa organised in time."" ""Travel visa?"" He bit down on his bottom lip, nodding his head. Smiling bravely, I approached him, ""When are you supposed to leave?"" ""In a few days,"" he answered as we both left my office, walking side by side. ""That's extremely short notice."" He was silent and I glanced curiously up at him. ""Unless, it isn't."" ""I've known for a while,"" he admitted quietly, ""But I was unsure of how to tell you. There were moments when I approached your office to tell you, only to chicken out and change my mind."" ""Well, you're going for your work, aren't you?"" Trying to dismiss the mangled mess of hope and sadness that took root in the pit of my stomach, I smiled up at him, ""Besides, we can keep owling as we did the last time and I will, of course, love to help you if you require my assistance again."" Smiling down at me, was quick to turn his eyes away from mine. ""Thank you."" ""Although there is a higher price this time."" My words had him glance inquisitively down at me as we boarded the lift. ""I had no idea that you were signing copies – that's my price, a signed copy."" Laughing quietly, he nodded his consent. ""If that's all it takes."" He grew silent again, taking me by surprise. ""Newt?"" Placing a hand on his arm, I watched as he forced himself to smile, shaking his head a little. ""It's nothing,"" he assured me as the lift opened on the correct floor. Alighting from the lift, we headed to the exit points. ""If you are sure – I guess I shall see you when you get back? Unless you're available to meet before then?"" ""I'll owl you."" Smiling in parting, I walked towards one of the apparition points. Growing attached to him was one of the most stupid things I had ever done. The man was out of the country for months, even years at a time and he didn't seem to reciprocate affection of any kind for me. Although – ""Come with me."" ""I'm sorry?"" My eyes looked over the man who had rushed to cut in front of me. Newt stood in front of me, blocking my path. He swallowed audibly, gathering his courage as he repeated himself. ""Come with me."" ""I don't even know where you're going,"" I protested despite the feeling of my heart picking up. ""Everywhere,"" he rushed out, ""Everywhere and anywhere. I'm starting with Bulgaria first and going from there. So come with me."" ""Newt –"" ""It's quite impossible for me to imagine leaving you behind with the likes of bleeding Morrison."" He looked uncomfortable with the attention that the passing people gave us but continued on otherwise, walking towards me as he spoke, ""I've grown too attached to you to just let you go like this."" I looked around at the small crowd that was gathering around us, ""What would people say?"" ""That we're mad,"" he said with a shrug, ""But I've heard that throughout my childhood and it means nothing to me now. I know it's improper and that society says a woman of 26 should be married by now and be looking after the kids at home –"" He trailed off, laughing when he saw the face I made – he knew exactly what I thought about the 'role of women' as seen by society. ""I'm 27 in a few weeks,"" I added. ""A woman soon to be 27 then,"" he allowed, ""And they'll wonder how a single man can ask a woman who isn't his anything to travel the world with him, but I don't care. I am asking. So please, please come with me."" Regarding him in silence, I giggled a little when someone from the crowd shouted at me to go with him. Newt, realising the size of the crowd he'd drawn, blushed but kept his eyes on mine. He was waiting for my answer. ""I'm sorry,"" I apologised as I approached him, rising onto my toes to wrap my arms around his neck. He very hesitantly wrapped his arms around me. ""I'm sorry but I can't go with you – you of all people know how hard I worked to get to the position I'm at now and I can't give that up. Not even for the chance your offering me."" ""I shouldn't have –"" ""No,"" I said gently into his ear, the hug lingering as neither of us wanted to pull away, ""Don't dismiss what you just said. I want to come with you, Merlin, I really do but I can't. But I want what you're offering in the sub context more and when you're back I'll take you up on the offer."" I pulled away from him them, my arms returning to my side. Looking up into his eyes, I refused to move further away from him. He smiled gently down at me. ""Do you mean that?"" ""I do."" Grinning foolishly, I let out a breath to try and calm myself. ""When you're back from Bulgaria, or wherever you're off to, come and find me. I'll be waiting."""
25,0,57,0-everlovingdeer-57.txt,harry-potter,everlovingdeer,"quietly. Mr and Mrs Scamander were stood in the corner of the room after having floo'd over the moment they received news of my worsening health. They had wanted to see me once more and I was glad to have been given the chance to see them. I blinked slowly, summoning the strength to turn my head towards my parents and mustered up a small smile. Father struggled to return it but mother didn't even try to. She dropped her head, taking in a shuddering breath. Despite myself, I felt my own eyes fill with tears and tried to blink them away. It didn't work and instead they fell. My bedroom door was thrown open with force and everyone turned to look at the doorway as the two Scamander brothers walked into the room. Theseus, the one to slam the door open remained frozen in the doorway, too shocked at the state he'd found me in. Newt, who had been standing behind his brother dodged past him and came to my side in an instant. ""I got word that your heartbeat was dropping,"" he murmured, kneeling beside the bed, eyes scanning over my face. ""I didn't want to believe it but –"" I sniffled, trying to hold back my tears but it was no use. Blinking slowly, I met his eyes and murmured, ""I must look a sight."" ""I think I found something,"" he began urgently as Theseus approached the bed, eyes locked to my face. ""It's ok,"" I assured him, my words no more than a whisper as I struggled to lift a hand to his face. I didn't quite make it. Newt took my hand, pressing it against his cheek and nuzzling into it. Smiling through my tears, I repeated, ""It's ok. I got to see everyone one more time. I'm with everyone I love."" ""Don't talk like that,"" Theseus demanded from behind Newt who glanced over his shoulder at his brother, releasing my hand. ""This isn't the end. It can't be."" ""Thee –"" He shook his head fiercely. ""No! You're supposed to grow old and grey and be surrounded by grandchildren, not – not like this."" Reaching out my hand towards him, I smiled gently when he took my hand and pressed a kiss to the back of it. ""Thee, you can't save everyone. Isn't that what you always told me?"" ""But you were the one I wanted to save the most,"" he murmured back finally, and for the first time since we had been children, his eyes filled with tears. ""Weren't you the one that always told me that if there was something I wanted with all my heart, something that I put all my effort into, then there was nothing stopping me from accomplishing it? Then why can't I save you?"" ""Maybe you're not meant to,"" I said after a moment's thought, looking between the two brothers. What had I done to deserve the love of two of the best men I'd ever known? Distantly I heard mother begin to sob even louder and glanced her way. Father tried to quieten her down but when it became evident that mother was only getting started, he made her rise to her feet and escorted her to the corner of the room. They spoke in hushed words and I looked to the clock. There was only minutes left. I looked back to Theseus when I felt him help me to sit up. Without a word, he moved the hand he was still holding towards Newt. The two brothers shared a look and before I could ask what was going on, Newt made me clasp my hand with his. ""Newt,"" I began warningly, recognising the gesture, ""what are you doing?"" ""I did my own research,"" he admitted, looking to his brother and nodding. Thee pointed his wand towards our clasped hands and our parents fell silent, watching in a tense silence. ""I can buy us – you some time until we can organise the binding."" ""Thee don't do this,"" I said but it was no use. ""We don't know what will happen to him."" Theseus cast the incantation, and I watched as magic bound my and Newt's hands together. They were really willing to cast an Unbreakable Vow but what would they do when, after I passed, Newt was rendered unable to fulfil his vow. He'd die and I couldn't possibly allow that. I attempted to pull my hand back from his but the magic was too powerful, keeping my hand clasped with his. ""Will you, Newton Artemis Fido Scamander, bind yourself to Miss Copeland in the means of the traditional blood binding?"" Theseus asked and before I could process the first vow, I heard my mother gasp. Newt's eyes never faltered from my own. I made one last effort to pull my hand from his, but his hold on me tightened. ""I will."" It was too late. The first vow had already been made. ""Will you bind your soul to this woman for the rest of your life, for however long you shall live?"" ""I will."" ""Will you accept her as your wife and fulfil your duty towards her?"" My eyes flickered to the clock behind Newt's shoulder. ""I will."" Thee ended the spell and I drew my hand away from Newt's, staring at it in sick awe. I could feel the magic beginning to move up my arm and travel slowly through my body. The binding magic of the vow fought with the centuries old curse and I gasped, my hand beginning to burn. Looking to Newt's face, I found him watching me cautiously. It hadn't worked and now he was going to die alongside me because he wouldn't be able to keep his vow. ""What have you done,"" I murmured, despairing. I pitched forward suddenly, eyes rolling into the back of my head as I slumped against his chest. The last thing I heard before losing consciousness was a sob. The clock had struck 12."
26,0,50,0-everlovingdeer-50.txt,harry-potter,everlovingdeer,"a word or make a sound, he had grabbed me and begun to pull me after him. I rolled my eyes and followed him silently because, after having known him for five years, I'd come to realise that going along with him always saved much more time. Had he become so annoyed by my avoidance of him that he'd resorted to kidnapping me in broad daylight? ""You've got to be kidding me,"" I muttered, giving him a look as he stood in the entrance of one of the unused classrooms. ""Merlin this is cliché."" Fred, uncharacteristically, remained silent and I gave him a concerned look, slipping past him on my way into the classroom. He shut the door behind him, casting a locking charm on it as I sat down on top of one of the tables. ""You must want to have a pretty serious conversation,"" I said looking down at my swinging legs when it became obvious that he wasn't planning to say anything. ""You're worrying me a little Fred, you never used to lock the door when you abducted me."" ""It's just a precautionary measure,"" he assured me, ""It's just to make sure you don't run out before I finish saying all that I want to say."" Furrowing my eyebrows, I hopped off the table. ""You're beginning to worry me a little."" ""It's nothing,"" he insisted, his words contrasting strongly with his body language. He began to pace in front of the door slightly, rubbing the nape of his neck. ""Fred?"" Walking towards him, I went to touch his arm. He cleared his throat before I made contact. My frown deepened. ""What's going on?"" ""Over Christmas I had some sense beaten into me,"" he explained as though I was supposed to understand the hidden meaning behind his words. I didn't."" ""Sense beaten into you?"" I repeated slowly, ""What do you mean?"" ""James had enough and decided to interfere."" His words were confusing me even more. Looking down into my face, he realised this and let out a slight sigh, ""About you being like another sister to me."" ""Oh."" Even I could hear from my tone of voice that I'd closed myself off from him. I went to step away from him when Fred caught my hand, keeping me beside him. ""You're not like a little sister to me."" He stared down at me as if that was supposed to be news to me. Searching his eyes, I swallowed nervously, ""I know."" He simply nodded, already knowing it. ""You've never been like a little sister to me and I spent ages trying to force myself to think of you in that way."" ""Why?"" I could finally ask him the question that had been bugging me since I had realised how he felt. ""That's one thing I could never understand."" ""Merlin,"" he said as if it was a curse, running a hand through his hair. ""You're the same age as my sister. You're my little sister's best friend to make matters worse. Godric, I felt like such a creep when I started having a crush on you – I was bloody 16 and you were only 14. It felt so freaking immoral that I made you into my little sister to explain why I felt so protective over you. Do you understand now, why I whenever you would hint at it, that I played dumb? You must have felt like I was a right idiot when I knew what you were talking about the whole time."" I couldn't help but search his eyes again, admitting quietly, ""I still don't quite understand."" ""Do you think I understand any of this either?"" he threw back, stepping away from me with a sigh. Silence descended between us as I watched him with creased brows, trying to comprehend what was going on. This couldn't continue this way. ""Right."" I broke the silence, crossing my arms defensively when Fred turned his eyes to me. ""We can't keep doing this – make up your mind Fred Weasley because I'd like to sort this out, once and for all."" ""Make up my mind?"" he repeated, meeting my eyes. ""What do you mean?"" ""Am I or am I not like a little sister to you? It's the last time I'm going to ask you that question."" He didn't even think, shaking his head instantly. ""You're not – I shouldn't be thinking the things I think about you if you were like a little sister to me."" How could he say something like that with a straight face, I complained internally, as I felt my face heat up. I cleared my throat, ""So I'm not a younger sister."" Licking my lip, I felt my eyes widen as I saw his eyes trace the movement. He really wasn't hiding anything anymore. ""What am I then?"" ""My sister's best friend."" The hope that had started to bloom died instantly and I nodded. ""And … my girlfriend."" My eyes rose to his quickly and I gave him a dirty look as his lips curved into a knowing smile. ""You wish, Weasley."" His smile dimmed this time, eyes growing alarmed. He had assumed that me being his girlfriend was guaranteed. ""What do you mean?"" ""I mean I'm not going to be your girlfriend."" Stepping around him, I unlocked the door with a simple wave of my wand. ""Do you know how long I had to suffer because of your lack of knowledge regarding your own emotions? It is only fair that you suffer in the same way that I did."" ""Is it now?"" The smile was back, playing around the corner of his lips. ""It is,"" I agreed, stepping out of the room. ""But don't worry I won't make you wait too long."" The last thing I saw on my out was the large grin on his face. His gleeful, relieved laughter echoed around the empty classroom, spilling out into the corridor and I couldn't help but smile at the sound. Fucking finally."
27,0,46,0-everlovingdeer-46.txt,harry-potter,everlovingdeer,"of the pitch. Talk about a close call. My eyes drifted back to the team and groaned. The reporter might not have seen it but every single member of the team had and they were all grinning cheekily up at me. I forced myself to remain neutral faced, even as the team took to the sky and slapped Roger cheerfully on the back, as they went. According to Mr Campbell this was the most important match of the season. Although, according to him, every match was the most important match of the season. But no-one questioned it and I sat by his side as the two teams took to the sky to begin the match. The whistle was blown and Alistair moved instantly, getting higher in the air to get a broader view of the pitch. The quaffle, thrown into the air by the referee, was caught by Roger who the moment the ball was tucked against his chest, few towards the goal posts. Shielded from the incoming bludgers by the team's beaters defensive play, he arrived by the goal posts in the blink of an eye. The first goal was scored effortlessly. But the score tied up quickly. It was going to be a close match. Or rather it had seemed that way until the players had shared some secret sign and their form of playing had been switched out. They swapped from playing more defensively, to becoming more aggressive in their attacks. I sighed into my hands, already doing a mental count of the number of broken bones and fractures that I was going to have to heal once the game had finished. Merlin, I just prayed that there would be no deep cuts, or any blood to deal with. The teams tactical play was pulling off – the gap between the scores was increasing and it bought Alistair the time he needed to continue his search for the ever-elusive snitch. Alistair dove suddenly, his sudden burst of speed catching my attention as well as the attention of the other seeker who shadowed his movements. I watched as he nosedived towards the ground. My heart felt like it was pulling into my chest the closer he got to the ground. Pull up. Pull up. Pull up, I pleaded internally as the distance between Alistair and the ground shrunk even further. He pulled up suddenly and the other seeker, taken by surprise was unable to and was left to plummet to the ground. I slumped against my seat. Bloody wronski feint. The opponent seeker was on his broom again, flying towards the sky. Merlin, quidditch players certainly weren't human. They were probably made up of something completely different to the rest of us. Or maybe they were all just masochists. Suddenly the crowd let out an almighty gasp and I looked around in surprise, especially when I realised that Campbell was out of his seat, peering over the railings. The blood fled out of his face, his knuckles turning white from the grip he had and I peered curiously down into the pitch. I gasped, heart stopping for a moment before it started to pump mildly in my chest. When had he fallen off of his broom and why the hell wasn't he moving? The captain called for a time out and I hurried onto the pitch, my emergency medical kit flying after me. Kneeling beside Roger's unmoving form, I swallowed deeply and fumbled to open the kit. A hand was set on top of my trembling one and I glanced up, seeing that Campbell had walked down with me. ""Calm down,"" he ordered firmly, but kindly, ""If you panic here, then we're done for."" ""You're right,"" I took a deep breath, ""You're right."" Going through the procedures in my head, I checked for a pulse and checked his airways. When I knew that both were alright, I looked him over for any visibly signs of injury. Pulling my wand out from my pocket, I pressed it to his temple. ""Rennervate."" Nothing happened. Why wasn't anything happening? He wasn't responsive and the realisation made me start to shake again. I forced myself to power through it, even as tears clouded my vision. ""Rennervate,"" I tried again, my voice cracking half way through the word. Tears slipped down my face and I did nothing to wipe them away as I cast a diagnostic spell on him. Before I could finish reciting the spell, he sat up suddenly, looking right as rain and kissed me. There was an audibly relieved sigh from the crowd followed my exclamations of surprise. My own muddled mind took a good while longer to process what had happened and when I realised that he was alright, he was awake and breathing, I let my tears fall freely. Somewhere in the back of my mind, I processed that Roger had done it on purpose, he had faked it all, and I was choosing my way to kill him but for now I returned the kiss, my relief obvious. He pulled away with a chuckle, setting his forehead on mine. ""Try and hide it from the reporters now."" My mouth parted in shock and I pounded on his chest. I was on the verge of crying again – this time in sheer relief. ""You utter piece of crap, you dick-faced twat. You – you flobberworm, how dare you –"" He caught my wrists, stopping me from hitting him anymore. Wincing slightly, he muttered, ""That hurts you know."" His voice trailed off, seeing my tears for the first time and he looked genuinely apologetic. Good, he should feel apologetic. ""I didn't think you'd cry."" ""You didn't think at all you bloody asshole."" He sighed, dropping my wrists and wiping my tears away before taking me in his arms. ""You know tears are my weakness."" The team stood around awkwardly, watching as Roger calmed me down with gentle words, all while I kept cursing at him and hitting his chest."

Instead of leaving, they sat down in the seat beside me. A hand took the quill from my hands, forcing me to look up again. Setting the quill down in front of him, Remus crossed his arms over his chest and leaned back in his chair. ""Maybe I should ask you the same question?"" He raised an eyebrow. ""I thought I was going to Hogsmeade with you but instead your friend appeared."" ""But I'd never said that I was talking about me,"" my voice trailed off, realisation dawning on me, ""You wanted to go to Hogsmeade with me."" Remus coloured slightly, but nodded anyway, ""And I thought that you wanted to go with me."" ""I did,"" I blurted out before I could stop myself, ""I do."" ""Then what happened?"" He sighed and shook his head, ""Explain to me because I'm so confused."" ""She likes you,"" I said quietly, looking down into my hands. ""Amaris likes you and she asked me to set the two of you up –"" ""And you couldn't tell her that you like me too?"" ""I thought you'd prefer her."" He was silent following my words, ""Isn't she the type that guys prefer? She's much more beautiful than I am-"" He took my face in his hands, silencing me. ""Maybe that's true for most guys, but I'm not most guys."" He dipped his head down, watching me as he drew closer. My eyes shut without my consent and he closed the distance between us pressing his lips against mine. Before the kiss could progress, before I could return it, I drew back at the sound of a sharp gasp. My eyes drifted over his shoulder and to the girl standing behind him. ""Amaris –"" She turned and left the library. Packing my things quickly, I chased after her and left Remus sitting where he was. I followed her towards the common room, trying to get her to listen to me but she wouldn't. Storming through the common room, she headed up to our dorm and made a beeline for her bed. ""Amaris, please,"" I said quietly, trying to get her to meet my eyes. ""You have to let me explain."" She drew the curtains closed around her bed and I sighed, dropping down onto my own. How had I screwed up so monumentally? ""What's the matter?"" a voice asked from the doorway and I raised my eyes to Pari's. She looked between me and the closed curtains of Amaris' bed. ""I messed up."" I avoided Remus for the rest of the term by switching rounds with other prefects and switching seats in potions with Potter. Whilst I was avoiding Remus, I was also being avoided by Amaris. Merlin, I had no idea what to do. Just like that, the term came to an end and with it Christmas holiday came and went. I found myself back in the Hufflepuff common room before I knew it. I was supposed to be getting ready for my patrol but I couldn't bring myself to do it. Remus was bound to be waiting with a million questions that I wasn't sure I could answer for him. Earlier today, I had attempted to swap shifts with Potter, only to be told by Potter that he wasn't going to let me swap shifts anymore because I needed to sort things out with Remus. I was tempted to go to Lily, but something told me that she would have said the same thing. Forcing myself to my feet, I went to leave my dorm when the door swung open to reveal Pari and Amaris on the other side. I stepped out of the way to let them both into the room. ""Where are you going?"" Amaris asked, shutting the door behind her. I felt my eyebrows rise in shock – that was the first thing she'd said to me since she'd seen us in the library. ""I'm scheduled to go on patrol soon."" ""With Remus?"" I nodded, looking away from her. She sighed and threw herself at me. I stumbled from the impact of her hug. ""Amaris?"" ""You bloody idiot,"" she muttered against my shoulder, ""Why didn't you tell me that you liked him? What would you have done if Pari hadn't explained everything to me?"" My eyes widened as I met Pari's eyes from over Amari's shoulder. I thanked her silently and she rolled her eyes – she was the typical mum friend, always sorting our messes out. ""I'm sorry,"" I mumbled, returning her hug. ""What are you sorry for?"" She pulled away to give me a look, ""There's no need for you to be sorry. Merlin, I should have noticed it sooner."" She righted herself and straightened out my uniform. ""Now, hurry up or you'll be late – go and get your man!"" The change in my mood was obvious from the way I walked but as I drew closer to the great hall, the happiness I felt at everything with Amaris being sorted out, drained away. Nervousness took its place as I wondered what I was going to tell Remus. He was waiting for me beside the doors of the great hall, once again. ""Remus,"" I called out once I was close enough. The sound of my voice made him straighten up. ""I didn't think you'd come."" ""I'm sorry,"" I floundered for words, ""I know I should have said something to you and I shouldn't have gone out of my way to avoid you but –"" ""Just don't do it again,"" he interrupted me. He gave me a firm look, closing the distance between us. ""Don't shut me out again and I'll forgive you."" Raising my eyes to meet his, I asked, ""Promise?"" He smiled gently, ""I promise."" Clearing his throat, he held his hand out, ""Now, let's start out rounds."" Slipping my hand into his, I went readily to his side. ""Lead the way."""

The twins were adamant that I was not to do any heavy lifting and I decided not to waste my breath with reminding them that magic existed for a reason. I just did it anyway – much to their joint annoyance. Godric, Lee was even worse. As I sat in the storeroom, doing an inventory check I looked up as I heard approaching footsteps. Lee popped his head around the door, looking around the room until he found me sat at the desk. ""Do you need anything?"" he asked quietly. I shook my head, barely concealing an eye roll. ""For the tenth time, I'm fine. The three of you don't need to keep hovering around me."" He looked suitable chastised. ""Alright, I'll relay the message to the twins. Make sure you call one of us over when you've checked that box."" ""Will do,"" I called out, turning back to the large cardboard box that was open in front of me. Counting the products inside the box and crossing the final item off of my clipboard, I struggled to my feet with a grunt. Rubbing a soothing hand over my stomach, I used the other to snag my wand from the table top. Levitating the cardboard box behind me, I slowly made my way into the main shop floor. Why would I bother calling them for help with something that I was perfectly capable of doing myself? I waddled, as Fred liked to remind me, into the shop floor and headed towards the empty shelves. ""Out of the way,"" I muttered quietly, brushing past George who threw me an exasperated look when he realised that I hadn't listened to them. Again. ""Heavily pregnant woman on the move."" Fred hurried down the aisle, dodging past him twin and rushing towards me as I levitated the box to the ground. He sighed, clearly frustrated that I was on my feet again. Before he could even begin to tell me off, I started to levitate the products onto the shelf. ""You should really be off your feet,"" he reminded me gently, taking my hand as if to forcefully pull me back to my seat. Narrowing my eyes at him, I glared until he let go of my hand. ""I'm pregnant Fred,"" I ground out, ""not an invalid."" ""I know, I know,"" he hurried to assure me, already used to my mood swings. ""But your feet are all swollen up."" Rolling my eyes, I eyed him in irritation and muttered, ""You're so bloody overprotective."" I winced sharply after my words and Fred was there in a heartbeat, arms coming round as if to shield me. Rubbing a hand over my stomach, he searched my face with concern written in his eyes. ""Love –"" ""Don't you start,"" I warned lowly, straightening up and making him remove his arms, ""it's false labour."" ""Is that even a thing?"" he questioned suspiciously. ""It is,"" his mother confirmed as she came out of the store room after having apparated into the shop. She lifted up four brown paper bags and announced, ""I've brought lunch."" ""You're a lifesaver, mum,"" George announced as he appeared behind her and pressed a kiss to her cheek. ""None of you love me more than when I've got food,"" she muttered in mock despair as she continued on her way towards us. She handed me a bag, smiling encouragingly, ""Prawn and gherkin sandwiches."" I grinned warmly at the older woman, taking the bag gratefully from her. ""Thank you."" ""Just looking after my grandchild,"" she insisted, handing Fred his lunch. As I watched Fred I pinpointed the exact moment where he decided that his mum was going to be his greatest ally. His entire expression brightened as he turned to his mother. She eyed him warily; that expression meant trouble. But I knew that this time, the trouble would be for me. ""Mum,"" he said quietly, ""will you have a word with the missus? She's been ordered on bed rest but won't stay put. She won't sit down and her feet have swollen up!"" Mrs Weasley looked to my feet which had in fact swollen up and she narrowed her eyes. Before his mum raised her eyes to mine, I glared at Fred who seemed a little too pleased with himself. The older woman looked up at me, linking her arm through mine. ""Why don't we go and sit down for a bit?"" she suggested, leading me forcefully back to the storeroom, ""We can sit and chat for a while."" ""Mrs Weasley –"" ""That's mum to you,"" she said firmly, ""Besides I'm sure the three boys can handle things here, isn't that right?"" There were shouts of agreement and I struggled not to narrow my eyes in response. I knew when I had lost and so I let her lead me slowly, but silently away from Fred. Or that had been the plan until I felt a sudden release of pressure, followed by a warm trickle down my legs. I gasped aloud, surprising the other four people in the shop who hurried towards me. ""This isn't supposed to be happening yet,"" I protested, looking at Mrs Weasley – mum – with fear filled eyes. I wasn't ready yet! ""I've got another two weeks until my due date."" ""Babies rarely come on time,"" she assured me calmly, even as the three grown men began to panic around me. ""What's going on?"" Lee asked, voice loud with alarm. ""She's going into labour,"" George said as if it wasn't obvious. ""Why she's doing it in the middle of the shop though, I have no idea!"" ""Like I could control that,"" I snapped, coming out of my stupor. I looked to my husband who had gone pale, freezing in place. Reaching out to fist his jumper in my hand, I pulled him towards me and hissed as the first contraction hit, ""Frederick Gideon Weasley, if you faint on me then I am divorcing you!"""
30,0,22,0-everlovingdeer-22.txt,harry-potter,everlovingdeer,"minding my business, making my way back to my common room when I had the misfortune of catching one of my house out long after curfew. And I knew exactly who the first year Gryffindor was. Merlin, it had been just under a week since the school year had begun and the first year was already causing so much mischief. ""James Sirius Potter,"" I barked out, startling the first year who jumped at the sound of my voice. He turned towards me with an innocent grin and I narrowed my eyes at him. ""Jones,"" he greeted back as I approached him. With a sigh, I asked, ""Why are you already losing points for our house?"" ""You don't need to take points from me,"" he pointed out, ""No one will know that you didn't take points from me. We can keep this a secret between the pair of us."" ""Nice try,"" I said dryly. ""Now why are you hanging around the castle in the middle of the night. Curfew was hours ago."" He grinned, smiling up at me. ""I was actually hoping to run into you."" ""Why?"" ""I'll tell you on the way back to the common room,"" he suggested, playing with his wand. ""Fine,"" I grumbled as I threw him a look. He acted oblivious to it and started to walk towards the common room. I walked beside him, wondering when being Head Girl had turned into babysitting the eldest Potter child. James walked beside me in silence, seeming like he wanted to say something but didn't know how to begin. ""Whatever it is that you want to say to me, you can just say it,"" I promised, ""I'm not in the position to judge anyone. So feel free to say whatever you want."" He nodded and after a moment he began to speak, ""Teddy spent a lot of the summer over at my house. He wasn't like his normal self and he spent the entire time moping. Mum and dad tried to talk to him but –"" ""Look James,"" I cut in meaningfully, ""I don't want to talk about this – especially to a first year that I don't really know. I'm not even sure how you know about me."" ""Teddy told me. If you don't want to talk to me, then just listen to me,"" he said bluntly, ""he's like my older brother. And that, Jones, makes you like my sister-in-law."" ""It really doesn't."" ""It does,"" he insisted as if his first-year wisdom outweighed mine. ""And stop interrupting me."" ""Why are you so nosy?"" I wondered curiously, looking briefly towards the first year. ""I'm half Weasley,"" he said with a shrug as if that explained everything. ""Look I might seem like a dumb first year but I care about Teddy and I don't like to see him so upset. He really likes you."" James looked to me, waiting for me to say something but I had nothing to say. My silence had him sighing and just as he went to say something else, we happened to run into Teddy. His eyebrows rose in surprise at the sight of me and I didn't react to the way his lips curved upwards when he saw the way I was wearing my uniform – or lack of uniform. I folded my robes self-consciously over my pyjamas. He looked back to this godbrother and frowned. ""How did you managed to get caught?"" he asked the younger boy who was already grinning at him. ""Don't you have the cloak and the map?"" ""Cloak? Map?"" I questioned but they both chose to say nothing. James reached out to pull on Teddy's robes. ""Walk us back to the common room? I don't trust Jones to keep me safe."" Scoffing, I reminded the first year, ""You trusted me to protect you before Teddy arrived."" ""Alright fine,"" James drew out the word, rolling his eyes as though he was humouring me. ""You can protect me, and Teddy can protect you . Ok? Can we go now?"" Rendered speechless by James, I walked silently beside him as the three of us walked towards the Gryffindor common room. As we walked silently through the corridor, I caught James trying to move to the other side of Teddy so we were standing together. Before he could move, Teddy reached out to fist the back of James's robe in his hand and made him stay where he was. James grumbled the rest of the way to the common room. When we reached the Fat Lady, James announced the password and hurried into the common room, but not before telling me to take my time. The portrait swung shut behind him and I was left staring at it in surprise. Cheeky little bugger. ""He's always been like that,"" Teddy explained quietly before turning to walk away. I reached out to grab his robe sleeve. He stopped mid step, looking at my hand and turning back to me. If this all went wrong then I was the biggest idiot on the planet, but how would I know if I never risked it? Playing safe wasn't always the best idea. It certainly wasn't the Gryffindor thing to do. Teddy called my name and I swallowed thickly. ""You better not make me regret this,"" I muttered as I raised my eyes to his. ""Regret what?"" I took a step towards him, watching as his eyes took in the shortening distance between us. Raising a hand to his tie, I used it to pull him down towards me. Surprise flickered through his features and he waited patiently to see what I was going to do next. ""I mean it,"" I swore firmly, ""don't make me regret this."" He shook his head, licking his bottom lip, ""Never."" Closing the remaining distance between us, I pressed my lips against his. Distantly, as Teddy pressed a hand to the small of my back and brought me closer to him, I heard the Fat Lady let out a wistful sigh."
31,0,54,0-everlovingdeer-54.txt,harry-potter,everlovingdeer,"sat me down on the sofa and locked the door before he removed the spell. I was on my feet the moment the spell was removed. Closing the distance between us, I ignored the fact that he had raised his hands in surrender and delivered a swift kick to his knee. He yelped, leaning over to rub at his knee. ""What in Merlin's name was that for?"" ""You're lucky I didn't kick you between your legs,"" I threw back, walking back to the sofa to sit down. ""You had better have had a good reason for putting on such a scene and abducting me."" ""I do,"" he insisted, straightening up and pocketing his wand. He made no move to sit beside me. ""Well out with it then."" I crossed my arms, ""I have plans Cedric – plans that your little stunt is going to make me very late for."" ""I well –"" ""I've got a date,"" I said trying to rush him, ""Hurry up and say whatever it is you need to say."" ""I know you have a date,"" he said slowly, ""But I can't let you go to it."" ""Why not?"" I demanded, watching him as he started to explain. He had better have a reason for – ""Because I don't want you to go."" I rose to my feet, intending to make my way to the door. Realising this, Cedric backtracked until he was standing between me and the door, blocking my exit. ""Did you ever think that I want to?"" ""Tell me that you've got feelings for your date and I'll let you go,"" he said quietly as I looked uncertainly into his face. ""Tell me that and I'll let you go."" ""Fine."" I rolled my eyes, looking away from him. ""I have feelings for him – now will you get out of my way?"" Taking a hold of my chin, he turned my head to make me look back at him. Clearing my throat, I went to look away from him when he narrowed his eyes at me and I stopped. ""Look me in the eyes,"" he said firmly, ""You've never been able to look me in the eyes and lie to me. So look me in the eyes and tell me that again."" ""I don't understand,"" I said instead, taking a few steps back making his hand fall to his side. ""Why are you being so uncharacteristically stubborn?"" ""You can't say it,"" he said suddenly enlightened. ""Cedric –"" ""And because you can't say it, I'm not letting you out."" Leaning against the door, he watched me with an annoyingly smug expression. ""What in Merlin's name is wrong with you?"" I couldn't help but demand, stalking towards him, ""Why does this have anything to do with you?"" It was his turn to look away, ""You had better answer me Cedric Amos Diggory, or I'll kick you where I was too kind to kick you before, and leave anyway."" He kept silent for a few moments and I sighed; it looked like I was going to have to kick him for real? And besides, it wasn't like one kick to the balls would break it or make him infertile, was it? ""What else am I supposed to do?"" he asked suddenly, bringing my attention back to him. He wasn't looking at me, a red flush creeping up his neck. ""What on Earth is it going to take for you to open your eyes and see me standing in front of you?"" ""What are you talking about?"" I asked quietly, ""Of course I see you Cedric. You're too tall to miss."" He sighed, running a hand through his hair – acting as dramatic as one of the newly heartbroken fourth year boys that liked to mope in the common room. ""That's not what I mean."" ""Then explain,"" I insisted, ""Tell me what you mean. And if you can't do that then show me or something."" He contemplated my words and started to speak slowly, ""Everyone says you have a crush on me –"" I went to cut in, becoming bright red as though he had just aired my dirty laundry. ""But –"" ""And I didn't believe them because it seemed too good to be true – why would the girl I've been chasing after for so long actually like me back?"" He rubbed the back of his neck, risking a momentary glance at me. It was like he expected me to say something but how could I when his words had rendered me speechless? ""And then Cho came up to me and told me that you did like me back but were hiding it for some reason and well –"" ""But I never told Cho that –"" My words made him look at me suddenly and I found my voice trailing off. ""So it is true then?"" His eyes regained that sparkle that he'd lost minutes earlier. ""I never said that,"" I protested, backing away as he drew closer to me. ""You didn't need to,"" he grinned handsomely and I felt butterflies erupt in the pit of my stomach. Merlin, this was not the time for that – He wrenched me against him, arm around my waist. Bracing myself against his chest, I looked up at him with wide eyes. ""What are you doing?"" Blinking up at him, I couldn't meet his eyes. ""Showing you,"" he explained with a bright smile, bringing his head closer towards mine. Surely he couldn't want to – ""Like you said to. Unless that's a problem?"" He stopped his descent, eyes alight with mischief and it was clear that he already knew my answer. But he halted anyway, waiting. I shook my head. I faintly heard him mutter, ""Merlin, finally,"" before he closed the distance between us and sealed his lips over mine. I very briefly extended a silent apology to the boy waiting for me in Hogsmeade who soon fled my mind as I leaned up, wrapping my arms around his neck."
32,0,9,0-everlovingdeer-9.txt,harry-potter,everlovingdeer,"thinking that we weren't – after all, you say so yourself in your office."" He shook his head slowly. ""Merlin's beard, make up your mind, woman."" I couldn't help but chuckle as he straightened up and approached me. Having learnt my lesson from the fiasco in my office, I walked around the room and away from him. I was determined to keep my distance from him – he wasn't going to crowd me into anything today. He said nothing about my obvious avoidance and instead followed me. ""You're impossible,"" I threw over my shoulder as I walked out of the kitchen. ""Should we get going then?"" ""Eager, aren't you?"" ""The quicker we leave; the sooner I can come home."" ""Not if I'm charming enough for you to not want to return home until tomorrow,"" he remarked, speeding up to cut in front of me on my way to the front door. Shooting him a look, I grabbed my coat and slipped my feet into my shoes. ""I'm not that sort of girl, Mr McLaggen."" ""Well that's a shame."" He chuckled at my facial expression. ""You're not that sort of girl at all and that's why I like you."" ""I'm not even going to ask you what you mean by that,"" I muttered, straightening out my clothes and raising an eyebrow. ""So, are we going or not?"" He held out an arm for me to take, ""Well come on then. We're apparating."" ""You did pass the test, didn't you?"" I asked doubtfully but took his arm anyway. As soon as I had taken his arm, he pulled me into his chest and wrapped it around my waist. ""Hold on tight."" Before I could say another word, he had apparated us out of my apartment and we found ourselves, moments later, standing in an alleyway between two buildings. Tucking his wand into his pocket, Cormac removed the arm from around my waist and instead took my hand instead. He led me by the hand, out of the alleyway and I took a look around us. My mouth parted in shock slightly, ""Are we in muggle London?"" ""We are,"" he confirmed but said nothing more as he led me through the busy streets, moving through the crowd of people. ""But why?"" I asked looking up at the man who was staring straight ahead as he navigated us. ""Well you're muggleborn, aren't you?"" He looked down at me briefly, ""I thought you'd like it if we spent some time in the muggle world. And not to sound big headed or arrogant, but I'm quite famous in the wizarding world – you saw the scene in the Three Broomsticks – a crowd tends to form and I don't want that. I want to be able to get to know you properly and enjoy our first date together."" ""That's sweet and all, but do you even know your way around muggle London?"" He rolled his eyes for me to see as we came to a stop in front of a coffee shop. Holding the door open for me to enter before him, he spoke, ""You underestimate me, Creevey. Where do you think quidditch players go on dates? It's one of the reasons that the paparazzi get so annoyed – the quidditch players that genuinely want to spend time with someone and avoid the paparazzi, head into the muggle world."" ""Really?"" Escorting me to a table, he narrowed his eyes playfully. ""You might be a sincere journalist but don't go and tell that piece of information to any of your paparazzi friends."" ""I won't,"" I promised, shrugging out of my coat and laying it across the back of my chair. ""Good, keep the secret to yourself."" He opened up a menu and I found myself doing the same. ""Now what can I get you?"" After placing our order, Cormac returned to the table where I was waiting. He took one look at my facial expression before sighing. Crossing his arms over his chest, he leaned back in his chair. ""What is it?"" ""I didn't say anything,"" I protested. ""I've seen you enough times to realise that you have a facial expression that you pull when you want to say or ask something,"" he explained, ""So ask away."" I chewed on the inside of my cheek, ""I don't know-"" He rolled his eyes. ""Hurry up."" ""Why do you like me?"" Seeing the incredulous look he was giving me, I hurried to explain, ""I just don't understand it – before the whole feature writing thing popped up, the last time we'd seen each other was at Hogwarts. I had been 15, crying my eyes out and you were probably uncomfortable as you comforted me. I just don't understand."" ""That wasn't the last time,"" he admitted. ""I'm pretty sure it was –"" ""Just because you think I didn't see you, doesn't' mean that I didn't."" He rubbed the back of his neck awkwardly. ""Your brother's a big fan of the team, right? So much so that he used to drag you along to games with me at the start of the year until you became busier with work. I'd just become the main keeper and from my goal post, I had a vantage of the VIP area. That's when I saw you."" ""And what?"" I narrowed my eyes in confusion. ""That, was it?"" ""No, I was curious about you."" He paused as our drinks were brought out to our table. Waiting until the waitress had left, he started to speak again, ""I hadn't seen you since the Battle of Hogwarts and to be honest, that day I'd wanted to stay and make sure that you were alright but Dennis was there so I left him to it. It started off as curiosity until it wasn't."" ""I still don't understand,"" I murmured, raising my mug to my lips. He chuckled slightly, ""I didn't think you would. But it's alright, we've got a long time for me to explain it to you."""
33,0,6,0-everlovingdeer-6.txt,harry-potter,everlovingdeer,"""What the hell do you think you're playing Zabini? Why do you keep kissing me? Do you not want the rumours to go away?"" ""Believe it or not Pucey,"" he drawled, staring up at me, ""you're the one fuelling the rumours this time round."" He smirked at my glare, ""You know, for such a smart girl, it really is taking you a long time to figure out."" His words had me thinking for a moment and I knew he could see the moment realisation dawned on me. He chuckled quietly, ""There you go."" ""The first rumour was true,"" I muttered, uncrossing my arms and fidgeting slightly. ""You do fancy me."" ""If we're going to use the juvenile word for it then yeah, I fancy you."" ""So,"" Draco piped up from beside Blaise, ""does this mean the two of you are together then?"" I shook my head, looking away from Blaise, ""No."" His eyebrows rose imperiously as he wondered aloud, ""How many more kisses is it going to take?"" I didn't have an answer for him but was spared the need to answer when Adrian walked into the common room. He made a beeline for the sofas and reached into his pockets to retrieve our wands. ""What the hell did you do in your detention?"" he demanded, handing Blaise his wand before holding my own out to me. ""Snape said that the pair of you need to report to Sprout for detention tomorrow night."" Glaring at Blaise, I adjusted my hold on my wand. Merlin, I was tempted to hex him. Besides, it wasn't like Adrian was going to take points from me anyway. ""What's going on?"" Adrian questioned and I decided to answer him when it was clear Blaise wouldn't. ""He got us in trouble again,"" I murmured, turning into Adrian. ""So, I'm going to hex him."" ""I can do it for you?"" he offered, ""We both know I'm better at it than you are."" ""The head boy can't keep going around hexing people."" Adrian nodded, looking past me to meet Blaise's eyes. ""Keep picking on my sister Zabini and I'll land you in the hospital wing."" Boys! Honestly. As instructed, we reported for our next detention to Sprout who requested our presence in greenhouse 1. Merlin, if Blaise did something to make us get another detention then I was going to kill him. Maybe it was a better idea for us to start serving out detentions separately. Sprout had told us to water all the plants in the numerous greenhouses and then we could leave. She saw no need to take our wands from us and I was thankful that it meant I could hex Blaise if he began to get too close to me again. Before she had left us alone in the greenhouse, she had said firmly that there was to be no inappropriate behaviour. I promised her that there wouldn't be and noticed that Blaise hadn't done such a thing. ""I'll be back in half an hour,"" Sprout said over her shoulder as she exited the greenhouse, leaving us alone. I got to work immediately; the quicker we started, the sooner we could leave. Grabbing a watering can, I noticed that Blaise hadn't made a single move from where he was standing. Rolling my eyes, I approached the hose that was mounted on the wall. Bending over slightly, I turned the hose on and filled up the watering can. ""Are you going to make me do everything?"" I demanded. ""Don't mind me Pucey,"" he said from behind me. Salazar, I could hear the smirk in his words. ""I'm just enjoying the view."" I scoffed, straightening up quickly. Turning the hose off, I muttered, ""You really don't act like a boy who's got a crush."" ""Do you expect every boy to act the same way?"" he asked, stealing the full watering can from me and handing me an empty one to fill. I made a face but filled the can without a fuss, watching as he started to water the plants one by one. We worked in silence again and I walked towards the new seedlings of the Chinese Chomping Cabbage. Looking over the instructions Sprout had left us, I read that these plants needed more water than usual and reached out to pull one of the small potted tubs towards me. Blaise was at my side in an instant, pulling my hand away from the plant just as the Cabbage awoke to snap at the air where my hand had previously been. Merlin. That thing would have chomped right through my hand. My eyes were still wide with shock when I turned to meet Blaise's unimpressed eyes. ""While I'm flattered to be able to distract you so much, I'd rather you pay attention to your safety,"" he muttered dryly and I gave him a look. Releasing my hand, he set his watering can on the counter and said without faltering, ""Now that everything's out in the open, how about I take you to Hogsmeade to make up for all the embarrassment I've caused you this week?"" ""What gives?"" I asked suspiciously, putting my own watering can down. Crossing my arms, I turned towards him, ""Why suddenly change tactic?"" ""Because my other tactic clearly wasn't working,"" he said honestly, surprising me. ""So?"" ""I don't know,"" my words were quiet as I asked quietly, ""if I agree, then you're not going to keep getting us detentions? The getting us into trouble ends here?"" He nodded but added, ""I can't any promises about not kissing you though."" Watching him for a moment, I nodded slowly and said in as casual a voice as I could muster. ""Fine."" Then, picking up my watering can, I turned away from him and continued to water the plants. I pretended that I couldn't feel his heavy gaze on me and made sure that he didn't see that way I was flushing at the turn of events. He'd never let me live it down."
34,0,26,0-everlovingdeer-26.txt,harry-potter,everlovingdeer,"for me, ""Or something."" ""Or something."" He cleared his throat, ""Since I'm not tutoring you anymore, maybe we should meet up sometime?"" My eyes widened a little as I reminded myself that we'd agreed to be friends. Smiling slightly, I rolled my eyes, ""Of course Louis, that's what being friends entails."" ""That's not what I meant,"" he explained, ""I don't really date my tutees and well, you're not one anymore. Are you?"" I cleared my throat, looking away from him as I asked quietly, ""Why?"" He grinned when I brought my eyes back to him, ""Because I like you."" ""I – you what?"" He laughed at just how incredulous I sounded and I took the opportunity to look around the hallway, realising we were walking towards the common room. ""I like you,"" he repeated confidently, making me falter in my step. ""So, Hogsmeade then?"" Avoiding his eyes, I nodded absentmindedly, as I did my best not the react to the way he was grinning at me. I jumped a little, growing startled when he reached down to take my hand in his as we continued our way to the common room. When the morning of the next Hogsmeade trip came, I found myself drawing into myself a little. Since Louis had mentioned going to Hogsmeade together, he hadn't brought it up again and I wondered whether he had decided against going together? And if he wasn't, was I supposed to meet him somewhere? Or wait for him to come to me? Merlin, this was confusing. ""What's the matter?"" Emily asked as she settled down beside me and helped herself to some toast. She shared a look with Eloise and Alice as if to ask what was wrong with me. ""Nothing,"" I insisted when the three girls stared at me as if trying to peer into my mind, ""I just didn't get a lot of sleep last night."" She frowned, eyes showing her concern as she looked over me from head to toe, ""Maybe you should stay in instead of going to Hogsmeade? It might be better to get some rest?"" ""Maybe the fresh air will do me some good,"" I insisted, eyes drifting to the Ravenclaw table which was still surprisingly empty. ""Maybe,"" she agreed unwillingly, ""I'll have to keep a close eye on you."" Eyeing her uncertainly, I bit my cheek and wondered how to progress. Seeing my eyes on her, she raised an eyebrow and I shook my head to dismiss her concerns. ""Didn't you have plans?"" I asked instead as I picked up my glass of pumpkin juice, ""I heard that Mason asked you to go with him to Hogsmeade?"" ""Well I told him I'm not interested,"" she began flatly, ""He and his STDs can keep themselves away from me."" I choked on my drink, staring at her with wide eyes. Looking across the table at the other two girls I saw that I wasn't the only one who was taken by surprise. Putting my cup down, I wiped my lips with a napkin, ""I'm sorry – what? Did you say that to his face?"" ""Of course I did."" She looked up from her plate to give me a look, ""I'd never say something about someone that I wouldn't say to their face."" ""I take it that was the reason why Mason spent all of yesterday complaining?"" Louis asked from behind us. Emily met my eyes briefly before we both turned to look over our shoulders, taking in the seventh-year boy stood behind us. I felt Eloise gently kick my shin, asking me what was going on and I met her eyes briefly. Looking back to Louis, I found him watching me expectantly. ""Have you had breakfast yet?"" I found myself questioning, trying to avoid the inevitable for a little while longer. ""I got an early breakfast,"" he assured me, smiling down at me. ""Should we get going then?"" ""You've got a tutoring session during Hogsmeade?"" Eloise asked incredulously, looking between the two of us. ""That some dedication, Louis,"" Alice praised and I wanted to curl up into a ball. How could I forget? She was a member of his fan club! ""But I thought you were going into Hogsmeade?"" Emily asked, confusion written in her features when I met her eyes. Looking back to Louis, I rolled my eyes. He had no business looking so amused by this situation. After silently giving me a probing look, he looked back to my friends and cleared his throat. ""We're going to Hogsmeade together,"" he announced as he leaned down to take my hand and helped me to my feet. Biting down on my bottom lip I looked back to my friends who had fallen silent. Emily not so secretly gave me a wink and Eloise was hiding her grin behind her mug of tea. Helga, I couldn't even look at Alice who looked a little stricken. ""Should we go?"" Louis asked again, looking down at me and I nodded uncertainly before allowing him to lead me out of the great hall. The moment we were out of the great hall, I pushed him in annoyance. He let out a laugh. ""Rowena, you should see your face."" ""Do you have any idea what you've done?"" I complained, ""You announce it in the great hall and the gossip is going to travel throughout the entire school by the time we come back from Hogsmeade. And Merlin, your fan club – they're going to kill me."" Even the thought of it had me wanted to hide in a corner. Growing up in this school had taught me just how wicked some of the girls could be, especially when it came to matters regarding a boy. Burrowing my head into my hands, I let out a sigh when I felt him take me in his arms. ""Don't worry,"" he said, still chuckling, ""I'll protect you from them."" Pulling back to look at him, I frowned up at him, ""You're not helping matters."""
35,0,13,0-everlovingdeer-13.txt,harry-potter,everlovingdeer,"How the hell am I going to tell them apart?"" ""Well I guess you'll have to find a way to tell them apart then won't you?"" ""I guess I'll just go ask them then,"" I said before excusing myself. Walking over to the twins I introduced myself. The twin on the left raised my hand to his lips and I raised an eyebrow. He glanced over my shoulder in the direction that I had just walked from. ""I'm Fred,"" he said, introducing himself as I pulled my hand back. ""And I'm George,"" his brother said, pushing Fred out of the slightly. I turned over my shoulder to throw Charlie a smug look; it was easy to find out which twin was which. But my expression froze when I saw his facial expression. ""What's his problem?"" I muttered quietly. ""Would you look at that?"" George said quietly as he wrapped an arm around my shoulder. ""He really did get jealous."" ""Would you boys leave the poor girl alone,"" Mrs Weasley said as she walked briefly out of the kitchen and spotted me. Swatting George's hand off of me, she took my hand and led me into the kitchen. When we were in the kitchen, I leaned against the counter slightly, ""Is there anything I can help you with?"" ""Actually there is,"" She said with a smile as she picked up a tray of warmed pumpkin juice. ""Can you give these out?"" ""Of course,"" I said taking the tray from her. Mrs Weasley called my name quietly, making me look up at her. ""You must mean a lot to Charlie; you're the first girl he's brought home."" ""Ever?"" "" Ever ."" I glanced down at the tray in my hands, ""You know I was worried; he's so far away from home and he's on his own. I was worried about if he'd ever settle down and if I'd ever get another daughter-in-law. But I'm not so worried anymore."" I cleared my throat slightly, ""I'm not sure about that – I, I should go and hand these out."" Handing out the glasses of pumpkin juice I talked to some of the people in the burrow. I tried not to give Mrs Weasley's words another thought but it was hard to do. When I reached Charlie, he took the tray out of my hands and put it on the table. Taking the last two glasses, he handed me one and took a sip of the other. ""You seemed to be getting along with the twins."" He said suggestively. ""They're too young for me,"" I muttered from behind the glass. At my words his expression changed and he returned to his normal self. Once all of the food had been brought out I found myself sitting beside Charlie at the table. My eyes widened at the sight of all of the food; I'd never seen so much food on one table. By the time we had all finished eating and we had been sitting down for about an hour, I rose to my feet. Merlin, I felt full and I had another Christmas dinner to eat today. Well, I guess I would be having a food coma tomorrow. ""I should go now,"" I said to Mrs Weasley as I headed to the door. ""Do you have to?"" Mrs Weasley asked, setting a hand on my arm, ""Can't you stay a bit longer? We've hardly spoken."" ""She can't Mum,"" Charlie said, appearing at my side with my coat in his hand. He held the coat out and helped me put it on, ""She's supposed to be having dinner with her family later as well."" ""Charlie's right Mum,"" Bill said, coming up behind Molly as he held a sleeping Victoire in his arms. ""Besides, she'll be family soon enough."" Ignoring his brothers words Charlie opened the door to. When I stepped out of the burrow, Charlie followed me out and looked back at his mum. ""I'll make sure she gets home safe,"" he assured her. ""Goodbye Mrs Weasley, Bill."" I stepped back into the house for a second to brush my fingertips affectionately across Victoire's cheek. ""Hurry and close the door Bill, Victoire will get cold."" When the door had closed, Charlie walked alongside me as I walked further away from the house and towards the apparition point. ""You were keen to get me out of there weren't you?"" I asked teasingly, looking at a silent Charlie. ""Only because Mum would try to use you to get a lot of dirt on me,"" he assured me, wrapping an arm around my waist in preparation for apparition. ""You've been living with me for 4 months now, you'll be a gold mine."" I nodded when something above me caught my eyes. ""What's that?"" Following my gaze, he let out a curse. ""It's one of my brother's inventions; magical mistletoe. It's not going to leave us alone until we –"" ""Until we kiss?"" ""Yeah that. "" ""Really,"" I muttered, turning to look at him, ""You're making this a bigger deal than it is."" I reached onto my toes to press a chaste kiss to his lips. Pulling away from him I felt his arm tighten around my waist, pulling me against him. He dipped his head towards mine and pressed his lips against mine again. A sudden wolf whistle rang out and we shot apart. Glancing back towards the burrow I saw that the front door was open and Bill stood grinning at us, Victorie no longer in his arms. Percy was standing beside him, his arms crossed across his chest. Percy seemed to grumble something under his breath before pulling out some coins from his pocket and setting them into Bill's open palm. ""Unbelievable,"" Charlie muttered, his words cut off when I leaned up to press my lips to his again, ignoring the bystanders. There was a sudden shout of joy, one that was distinctly Mrs Weasley's. I felt Charlie smile against my lips as he apparated us away."

That way we can properly talk about this."" ""I'm being serious here, George,"" I insisted, ""Tell your mother I broke up with you and that you're not ready to date – that'll stop her trying to set you up with anyone for a while."" ""Listen to me."" His was firm as he shifted all the parcels into one arm, the other coming out to grab a hold of my arm and halt my progress. With mild trepidation, I forced myself to raise my eyes to his, taken aback by the fire blazing in them. ""If you're going to end everything so callously, then you better be prepared to explain it all to me."" ""Anyone would think that we really were dating,"" I said lightly, trying to inflict some humour into the situation. He didn't buy it, ""An explanation is the least I deserve, don't you think?"" ""Come on George."" Laughing away his seriousness, I stepped away from him making his arm drop back to his side. ""You of all people know that I want to be an author – it's time I focused more on that."" ""I understand that, but I don't believe for one second that that's the only reason. So you'd better tell me the truth."" Backing away from him slightly, I adjusted my hold on the parcels in my hand, ""We don't have time for this. If we don't get these sent off them you'll end up losing customers – and we can't have that."" ""Fine,"" he nodded briskly, gesturing for me to lead the way, ""I'll help you and you can explain it all to me whilst we work."" Leading him out of the room, I screwed my eyes shut and steeled myself. Really, what would be the worst thing that happened if I told him the truth? He didn't strike me as the sort of person to abandon his friendship with someone just because of a one-sided love. And it wasn't like I was going to be working here for much longer so there was no need for me to be around him every day. ""Fine,"" I said with finality as I put the parcels down on the workbench, my heart hammering even as I said the word. ""You want the truth? Here it is – pretending to be your girlfriend is complete and utter torture –"" He looked aghast, ""What –"" ""It's too bloody painful George to sit there and let you hold my hand and, and kiss me because you'd never do those things otherwise."" I turned away from him, absentmindedly wrapping the products in parcel paper. ""Merlin's beard George, I'm so fucking stupid because I'm hopelessly in love with you and it's bad enough that I'm masochistic enough to spend most of my week around you but to let myself keep pretending to be your girlfriend? That's too much for me."" He was silent and I was determined not to say anything. There it all was, he knew the truth now and there was no coming back from it. Ignoring his presence in the room, I continued to wrap each of the products and tie the delivery address to each of the parcels. Once I was finished, I magicked the parcels into a bag and headed off to drop them off at the owl delivery station. As I slung the bag over my shoulder, I headed to leave the back room and enter the shop floor, without a single look at the still frozen figure. ""You're absolutely mad,"" George finally said, coming to his senses when I stepped away from the work desk. ""I have no idea what you mean,"" I denied, letting out an exasperated sigh when he took my arm yet again. Looking back to him, I raised an eyebrow and waited for what he was going to say. The grin blooming on his face took me by surprise. He repeated himself, laughing a little as he spoke, ""You're absolutely mad."" "" I'm the one that's beginning to question your sanity."" ""No believe me Church, you're the mad one if you think I'm going to let you just walk away from me after what you've just told me."" He stared down at me, eyes alight. ""I don't understand,"" I admitted carefully. ""Neither do I,"" he confessed, ""But I'm getting there. From what I understand, you like me back and have done for a while."" ""Wait, like you back, implying that you like me too?"" He chuckled slightly, ""Do catch up, love."" Using the arm he still had a hold on, he pulled me towards him, ""You never did realise that the first time you had dinner in my apartment was a date, did you? I'd even announced it when we were in the burrow but you never realised."" ""That was a date?"" ""Godric you madden woman,"" he dropped his hand from my arm, bringing it up to my face to frame my jaw, ""Of course it was."" ""Are you two finally getting together then?"" a bored voice called from the doorway and we both turned to find Verity standing, watching the two of us with annoyance, ""It's been a long time coming, and I'm happy for you and all that crap but I'm going to strangle one of you if you don't get back out onto the shop floor and help me."" ""Yes, of course."" Stepping away from George, I felt heat creep up my neck. ""Let me just drop these parcels off and I'll be right with you."" ""You better be."" She narrowed her eyes at George as I tried to leave the room without drawing a lot of attention to myself, ""There better be no sneaking away during work to find a dark corner."" ""I can't make any promises,"" he said cheekily and I lowered my head in mortification, hurrying out into the main shop floor."
37,0,3,0-everlovingdeer-3.txt,harry-potter,everlovingdeer,"way, managing to avoid the swing. But he didn't manage to miss the second one. He reached out for me, trying to pry the cushion out of my hand as I continued to hit him with it. ""James Potter,"" I hissed, when he had the audacity to begin laughing at me. Merlin, I was beginning to laugh too, ""You are the biggest pain in the ass."" ""I'll kiss it better,"" he offered. I gasped incredulously, struggling not to giggle as I pushed him away. ""You have a filthy mind."" ""You understood what I meant,"" he retorted through his chuckles, falling to the sofa beneath him and pulling me down with him. His laughter faded slowly and I grew quiet under his eyes. ""Listen carefully Ward, I'm dying to kiss you so I'm just going to do it. Is that ok?"" I swallowed thickly, nodding slowly. He grinned, arms coming around my waist to cradle me against his chest. He didn't give me a chance to regret my decision. SIXTH YEAR James was a clingier boyfriend than I thought he would be and that was surprising. Godric, I had seen just how clingy he could be towards his friends so I sort of knew what to expect. But Merlin – the boy couldn't keep his hands to himself. If we happened to be together, one of his hands would casually reach out to run through my hair, to rest against the base of my neck, to hold my hand and so much more. I had thought that because we were back in Hogwarts, maybe the amount of physical contact he appeared to need would be reduced. Clearly, I hadn't been thinking straight. Throughout the welcoming feast alone, he had reached out to put his hand on top of my thigh at least a dozen times. I'd brought it up to him before – his need for physical contact – and he'd simply informed me that up until we had begun officially dating, it had taken a lot of restraint for him to stop himself from reaching out to me. The boys had left the table before we had and I had watched Sirius force James from his seat so they could get to the common room. I had rolled my eyes and turned back to my meal. I knew why he was hanging around; on the train to Hogwarts, Sirius had mentioned that girls talk to their friends about their boyfriends, and so chances were by the end of the week the girls would know every detail of our relationship. James wanted to hang around and make sure that I wasn't telling them something that they didn't need to know. And so, when we eventually left the Gryffindor table and made our way into the common room, we walked in to find the sixth-year boys lounging in front of the fireplace. James looked up at the sound of the portrait swinging open and gestured for me to walk towards him. I heard the girls begin to murmur behind me and decided against it; whatever James was planning to do they were only going to tease me about when we got to into our dorm. I went to walk past him. But of course, James being James, wasn't going to let that happen. He reached out to grab my hand, pulling me back towards him and bringing me down onto his lap. Before I could ask him what he was doing, he leaned in to kiss me soundly as if we weren't in the middle of the common room, as if our friends weren't surrounding us. I remained frozen against him, refusing to respond until there was a sudden round of wolf whistles. Merlin, I was going to kill Sirius. But, if we had the attention of the common room then there was no point in not doing this properly. I began to respond to James, reaching up to thread my fingers through his hair and hold him close to me. Growing breathless, I pulled back from him. ""What on earth are you playing at Potter?"" I asked, licking my lips. ""Giving out a statement,"" he said with a lazy grin, reaching up to push my hair behind my ear. ""Now no one else is going to try anything on you again."" He was smirking up at me and I shook my head in disbelief. ""You're such a child."" ""Maybe, but you love me anyway."" ""Keep telling yourself that,"" I muttered, hitting his shoulder as I hopped off from his lap. When I looked back out to the common room, most of the students pretended to get back to their own business. My friends, well, they didn't even bother to try. They simply marched over to me, pulled me away from James and forced me up the stairs to our dorm. ""I could tell something was different between the two of you during the train ride,"" Lily said before the dorm door had been closed behind us, ""But when did that happen?"" ""Over summer,"" I explained quietly, heading towards my bed. ""Oh no you don't,"" Marlene said firmly, walking towards me, ""the lead up to this has lasted for years, we're not going to let you dismiss this so quickly."" ""Don't you remember how the four of you interrogated me when I got together with Frank?"" Alice threw herself down on my bed, giving me a pointed glance, ""There's no way we're not letting this pass without hearing every detail."" ""Every embarrassing detail,"" Dorcas emphasised, sitting beside Alice. Crossing my arms over my chest, I looked at the four girls who were now sat on my bed, looking expectantly up at me. They waited and I immediately regretted doing the same to them when they began to date someone. If only I had minded my own business back then, they'd have left me alone now. ""Fine,"" I sighed, ""But it's a long story."" ""Perfect."" They shared a grin, ""We've got all night."""
38,0,44,0-everlovingdeer-44.txt,harry-potter,everlovingdeer,"""But what are you doing here?"" ""There's somewhere that I need to take you,"" he explained, putting the car into gear. ""Where is it?"" I couldn't help but be curious, and the curiosity only grew more when Neville didn't answer my question. His only response was to raise my hand to my lips before he drove off. ""Or can't you tell me?"" ""It's not that,"" he denied, ""I can tell you but I guess it'll be self-explanatory once we get there."" ""If you say so."" Eyeing him suspiciously, I turned my eyes back to the road. We made the familiar journey to my apartment and I couldn't help but be a little disappointed. Was this the place where he needed to take me? Seeing the disappointment on my face, Neville smiled reassuringly before exiting the car and motioning for me to do the same. ""I picked you up because I knew you'd head to bed before I would arrive at your apartment and well – I wasn't going to apparate with you on a campus full of muggles."" ""Apparate?"" I repeated curiously as we headed inside the building and up to my apartment to dump my belongings. ""So, the place where we're going is in the magical world?"" He nodded in agreement, ""It's a place called St Mungo's."" ""St Mungo's?"" Returning to his side, I waited for him to do whatever this apparition entitled. ""It's a hospital."" ""A hospital?"" My eyes looked over him from head to toe, ""Are you hurt? Did something happen during –"" ""It's fine,"" he reassured me as he wrapped an arm around my waist, ""I want to introduce you to someone and well, you'll see when we get there. Now, hold on tight."" I allowed Neville to apparate me away, the tugging in the pit of my stomach was an uncomfortable feeling and I came to conclusion that if I never apparated again then it would be too soon. Sticking close to Neville's side, I let him lead me towards a slightly run down department store wondering where exactly this hospital was supposed to be. But I said nothing, even when Neville prompted me to step through a bloody window. Upon arriving to the other side, my eyes widened slightly as I looked around what was clearly the hospital Neville was talking about. He took my hand, smiling reassuringly down at me before leading me to the fourth floor. According to the sign on the wall, this floor was for Spell Damage. Neville didn't wait around for long, he led me through the floor and towards something called the Janus Thickey Ward. Stopping beside the desk in front of the ward, Neville spoke briefly to the witch behind the desk who rose to her feet and started to do something to the door. ""The door's usually locked,"" Neville explained before I could ask anything. ""This ward – it's a long-term residence ward."" ""Long-term?"" I glanced curiously up at Neville who took in a deep breath, gathering himself before giving me a reassuring smile. He squeezed my hand and I wasn't sure whether the action was meant to give me strength or an attempt to gain strength from my presence. Regardless, I squeezed his hand in return and that was it before Neville led me into the ward and we approached two of the beds. My eyes first looked over the greying man who was busy staring vacantly at the wall in front of him before turning to the woman whose hair had gone completely grey – whilst she herself looked too young for such a thing to happen. Her resemblance to Neville was striking. I looked up at Neville, trying to confirm my suspicions when he stepped towards the older couple. ""Mum, dad, I'm back."" He settled down into the chair between the two beds and gestured for me to sit down beside him. The older couple showed no signs of recognising Neville but turned to listen to him as he spoke of what he had been up to since he had last visited then – only a week ago. Taking Neville's hand, I listened to him speak, leaning my head onto his shoulder as I reflected back to what I knew of his parents. Neville had been honest, he had told me about his parent's careers and how he had originally wished to follow in their footsteps by becoming an auror. He had told me how they had been tortured to the point of losing their minds by four death eaters on the very night that Voldemort had stolen Harry Potter's parents from him. His voice gradually trailed off and my voice took its place as I spoke to Neville's parents about what a brave man their son was and always had been. By the time visiting hours came to an end, we rose to our feet and prepared to leave. Mrs Longbottom reached out to take Neville's hand and Neville, as if he knew what she wanted, held out his palm for her. She dropped something into his palm and whatever it was, it made his head snap up to stare into his mother's eyes. Mrs Longbottom met her son's eyes with a smile, blinking away a few tears and before I could say anything, Neville had pressed a kiss to my temple and ushered me out of the ward. ""Are you alright?"" I asked cautiously as we headed towards the lifts. ""I'm fine,"" he assured me, looking down at whatever his mother had handed him. He held it open to my gaze, showing me his mother's engagement ring. ""Actually, I think I'm perfect."" ""Well,"" I said, my throat feeling as if it was clogged by unshed tears, ""There's no flowers or birds, but this is better."" He slipped the ring onto my finger, pressing a kiss to my hand after he did so. ""Really?"" I beamed up at him, rising to my toes to press a gentle kiss to his lips. ""Really."""

It had taken a few months but now, a year after the battle of Hogwarts, the shop was ready for its reopening. George had started by taking up a single shift a week which quickly turned into working 3 or 4 shifts. That soon spiralled into working every single day. His passion for the shop had returned with a vengeance and suddenly, two months ago, he had announced that he would be shutting the shop down for a few months in order to give it a complete fixing over. He had gone to work creating new products and I was by his side the entire time. I had taken the day off from work to help George set up and we were currently stocking the shelves with the new products as well as some old favourites. ""Do you think we're ready for the grand reopening?"" I asked, placing the last of the Skiving Snack boxes onto the shelf. Once I was done, I stood beside him as he scanned the entire shop. ""We should be."" ""Should be?"" I reached over to take the clipboard from his hands to check over the list of supplies. Ticking off the Canary Creams, I scanned over the list. ""I think that's about everything."" ""I just can't help but think that something's missing,"" he admitted quietly, biting down on his bottom lip. Hmm. Looking over the shop once again, my eyes settled onto a plain part of the wall behind the counter. There was nothing on it. ""I think I have an idea,"" I muttered before disappearing into the back room of the shop. When George had started coming back to the shop, I had ordered another portrait of Fred to be made and it had been placed into the back room of the shop. I thought that it made George feel less alone if he could actually talk to Fred as he created his products. Taking the portrait from the back room, I hung it up behind the counter. I peered at George cautiously. ""Is that better?"" I asked carefully. ""Much."" He said with a grin, coming up behind the counter to wrap an arm around my shoulder. He squeezed my shoulder and looked down at me. ""Are you ready to officially reopen?"" At my nod George walked over to the door. Unlocking the door he stepped aside as the first customers walked in. A crowd soon developed and I was pleased to see that many of George's customers had returned. Business picked up quickly as I rushed to make sure that the shelves were never empty. ""Watch out,"" George said as I tried to push through the crowd to restock a shelf. He pushed me behind him slightly to avoid being crushed. ""Is it always this busy?"" I asked him. ""Most of the customers are kids who are getting their prank supplies for when they go back to Hogwarts."" ""They're going to give Filch a heart attack."" I gave a slight smirk when I saw the number of children in the crowd. Seeing the line that was being to build up in front of the counter, I excused myself and headed to the counter. I started to ring up the total, smiling at the customers as I did so. ""How are we doing?"" George asked, appearing behind me after a few minutes to whisper in my ear. ""Is the reopening a success?"" ""I'd definitely say so."" I looked back at him with a smile. ""I don't think business has ever been better. But you might need to start hiring some staff if business continues to be like this. Or at least hire an assistant? ""Want to fill the position?"" He asked once I had dealt with the line of customers. Leaning against the counter, George crossed his arms over his chest. ""You can ditch your boring job in the ministry and help me."" ""I'll think about it."" He grinned down at me, jumping slightly when Fred's portrait let out a long suffering groan. We both looked at the portrait as it began to speak. ""Are you going to stand there all day Georgie, or are you going to kiss her?"" Colour assaulted George's cheeks, turning his ears a brilliant shade of crimson. He muttered something under his breath and walked away, leaving me alone. ""You can't run forever,"" the portrait called out teasingly at George's retreating back. ""Honestly,"" I said rolling my eyes at the portrait, ""Leave him alone Fred."" ""I'm only trying to speed the process along,"" Fred cajoled. ""Merlin knows I spent years trying to convince him to finally tell you how he feels."" A new line of customers had quickly formed in front of the counter, making me turn my attention away from the portrait. But its words kept repeating in my head for hours until it was time to close the shop down. ""Where do you think you're going?"" A voice asked, just as I stepped out of the shop. I jumped slightly at the sound of George's voice. ""Merlin George, you'll give a girl a heart attack."" I turned to face him as he dropped into step beside me. ""I thought you said you were closing up the shop."" ""I was."" Putting his hands into his pockets, he watched me carefully. ""You didn't answer my question; where are you going."" ""Home."" ""No you're not."" I raised an eyebrow. ""I'm not."" ""You're not,"" he repeated, closing the space between us to link an arm through mine. ""You're coming with me."" ""Where?"" I asked, making no move to pull my arm away from his. Instead I followed after him, knowing that there was no point in protesting. ""We're going on a date."" ""We are?"" I stopped in my tracks making him look back at me. ""You heard me."" George smiled patiently down at me as he pulled me into his side, ""I've decided to take Fred up on his advice."""

His inquiry into her neck was soon joined by his lips as she leaned back, embarrassed to answer, ""I … I don't know what … to … do."" She could feel his smile against her collar bone as his tongue traced the swell of her breast, his right hand sliding between her back and the mattress, unlatching her bra in one deft motion. ""Just feel how much I love you and want you."" Loudly gasping at the sensation of her bra being pulled away as his warm mouth encircled her left nipple, she luxuriated in the attention of his tongue as his right hand traced her ribs downward, his fingertips pushing beneath the elastic of her waistband. Fishtailing against the wet-hottest part of her, she began rolling her hips against the motion of his fingers. The sensation of his attentions was unlike anything she'd ever experienced, and the swell of pleasure began to escalate when she felt her panties being dragged down her legs. His lips tempted gooseflesh as his mouth descended lower, his tongue and lips parting the thin patch of hair that already glistened with her excitement, passion billowing on their staggered breaths as he began beckoning her secrets and tasting her fruit. Strokes of intent formed with every push of his tongue as he devoured her slowly at first, his pace increasing when a finger re-joined his tongue in the dance against the neediest part of her, spread wide and shuddering as she screamed into the air, her back arching off of the bed. She came in waves that threatened to drown her in the most delicious depths, star-white light pushing out her vision as she began spinning in euphoria. After many moments of silent, boneless-floating bliss, she felt the sensation of Edward's warm lips encircling one nipple while his fingers gently pinched the other. Her legs spread wider to allow him to fit between them, that part of him resting right where she suddenly needed him to be. She gathered her wits enough to tug at Edward's shorts, shouting, ""Off, please!"" He chuckled against her sensitive skin as he leaned back on his knees, his inked torso towering over her as he brought the waistband over his hips, pulling them under his knees and throwing the shorts into a heap onto the floor. Bella could not get enough of the naked man before her. She sat up to slowly trace the metal studs through his nipples and inked patterns on his chest, an exploration in silence as tension swirled around them. In a move that impressed even her, she took her hand and pushed against his shoulder as she spun along with his movement downward, chest to chest, throwing him off kilter; his back landed on the bed after her surprising show of strength, her legs straddling his waist, a self-satisfied smirk pushing into her right cheek. ""Since the moment I saw your picture, I've wanted you, without understanding what wanting was. And now I know exactly what I want, but I don't know how, so you'll have to … help me with this … "" Edward smiled in pride, welcoming her assertiveness. Despite her inexperience, she was still willing to take the lead – to be the fearless women who seized her own destiny at every chance. Spread wide and resolute, she angled her hips to allow the wettest part of her to lick at the tip of his rock-hard length, sinking slowly onto it as she swayed minutely above him - the press growing deeper as she stretched to the fill, pushed to the nudge, driving down deep until she was sitting on his hips. She stilled and waited for the burn to subside. He sat up and captured her mouth in a searing kiss, before moaning, ""Take me , Bella, everything I have to give."" He jostled his hips a little and she realized her own need to move against the friction building within her, caged and straining to escape. Moving his hands to palm her nipples, he squeezed them as they chased the delicious build, their momentum culling the star-shine together as they both came undone, their moans of completion joining their frenzied release as the most beautiful peace settled around them. They knew, in that perfect moment, that their intense connection was only just beginning. And what a beginning it was. Hours later, they lay sated beneath his sheets, the sunlight lingering with dusk as the cooler sea air carried with it blooming promises, caressing the bliss-laden lovers in Edward's bed. Wings outstretched like never before, Bella felt strong and satisfied in the life she'd begun making for herself. Accompanied by the man who loved her and was holding her now, she relished in the knowledge that so many of her dreams had already come true, her secret longings fed and reciprocated through a sacrament of shared body, respect and of love. She knew that in the years to come, they would face new challenges. Marriage. Altering ambitions. A growing family. Yet Bella also felt certain of the happiest future, of a life spent in Edward's arms and surrounded by a wonderful family who valued and loved her – reflecting how she'd also grown to love herself . With that certainty came a joy-bristling reality, a lesson of empowerment seeded in the soil of deepest truth: The secret to happiness would never be to bloom where she was planted. Fearless and embracing the unequivocal potential of her inner strength, she would, instead, always embrace the most powerful choice of all … She would continue to lean into opportunity and seek out the warm sunlight – to plant herself where she bloomed.

""Well, that I can't help. You obviously don't see yourself clearly."" ""So, there was no motivation other than you wanting to talk to me?"" ""I told you in the bathroom I wanted to fuck you the first time I laid eyes on you."" A shiver runs through me at the memory. ""But Bella, I had no clue how incredible that night would be. Believe me when I say, I was just as affected by it as you were. And for you to just piss on it because of my age the next morning…"" He kicks at a rock on the ground and turns away from me briefly. I use the opportunity to wipe the few tears that have spilled down my cheeks. His back is still facing me, and I can't take it. I have to see his face again, so I speak. ""It wasn't your age. It was the reality of our situation."" This catches his attention, and when he turns around, he takes a few steps closer to me. ""What reality are you talking about?"" ""Come on, Edward. Did you really see this working out? I'm old enough to be your mother. My son will be your frat brother for crying out loud! Not to mention all the gossip we'd create on the island."" ""I don't give a flying fuck about any of that."" He clenches his jaw tightly and glares down at me. ""I don't care how old you are. If I did, I would've asked that night at your house. I grew up having to watch my mother deal with that stupid gossip shit, and I hated it. It's one of the reasons why she left my dad. There's no way I'd let you suffer like that, too. As for your Garrett, he's a great guy, and I'll be proud to be his frat brother. But I know he loves you and wants you to be happy. If I'm the one who can do that, why would he have a problem with it?"" His words breathe life into a heart that's been locked away for far too long. ""What about your dad?"" He scoffs. ""He can think what he wants."" ""He wanted to date me before we met."" ""My dad has great taste; that doesn't surprise me. Did you want to date him, too?"" ""No. I tried… I tried to want to, but I just couldn't. The reason I was standing by the pool was because I was avoiding him."" For some reason, this revelation amuses him, and he laughs. And laughs. And laughs. Eventually, I give in and laugh with him. I'm not exactly sure what's so funny, but it feels good to let go like this. It feels good just being with Edward. The laughter finally fades, and Edward becomes serious again. ""Do you remember what you told me right before I got out of your car?"" ""That you're exactly what I need."" This time, I don't correct myself. ""Do you think it's possible for you to feel that way again?"" My eyes fill with tears again as I admit, ""I never stopped."" Edward closes the distance between us and crushes his mouth to mine. I'm caught completely off guard, but thank goodness my body automatically knows to mold itself to his. I have no idea how long we stand there making out, but I really couldn't care less. I can't believe I've denied myself this kind of joy these last couple of weeks. We have a lot of time to make up. We break away in order to catch our breath, and Edward wipes the remaining moisture from under my eyes. It's been so long since someone has taken care of me… has wanted to take care of me… that his gesture warms me from head to toe. ""So, how are we going to do this?"" I ask. ""Well, for starters, I'm going to take you on a date."" ""A date, huh? That sounds nice."" We link fingers and walk back into Garrett's building. ""What did you have in mind for our first date?"" ""How'd you like to go to a frat party tonight?"" His eyes are alight with mischief, and he just looks so damn happy. I do that for him— me . I can only hope he knows he does the same for me. In fact, I plan on making sure he does. ""No frat parties!"" ""Okay, okay, no frat parties. How about I surprise you?"" ""Yeah, I think I can handle that."" Honestly, I don't care what we do or where we go. I just want to be with him. ""How are we going to tell Garrett?"" ""Don't worry about him. Before I knew he was your son, I'd told him about this hot mom I met at a party a couple of weeks ago. Now, we just have to tell him it was his hot mom I was referring to."" Outside of Garrett's room, Edward wraps me in his arms and holds me close. ""I was afraid I'd never get the chance to hold you like this again."" The words are whispered into my hair, but I hear him loud and clear. ""Me too,"" I tell him before kissing him gently. Remembering the conversation I had with Rose and Alice a few weeks ago, I smile knowing I've achieved a couple of the goals they set for me: I found me some man-meat, got laid, went crazy for a while, and most importantly, put myself out there. As I prepare to face an almost certain scandal in my future, I do what I've needed to do for so long. I let go. Hosts' Reminder: Remember to leave the entry some love by hitting the review button.

42,4,34,4-MaytoDecemberRomanceContest-34.txt,twilight,MaytoDecemberRomanceContest,"He smiled at her reaction. ""Fine,"" she squeaked out. ""You just caught me by surprise."" ""Sorry, that's the last thing I'd want to do. "" He stifled his laughter. He started to move his finger inside of her. ""I just want to check your ovaries. It shouldn't take too long."" He moved his finger further in, taking his time so they could both fully enjoy the action. She was starting to feel dizzy from the heat being created by her own body. She wanted to move, but was cautious to do so. She didn't want him to stop. There was a distinct squelch from his glove as he placed a second finger inside of her. He moved them both in and out, sliding deeper and deeper until her hips bucked against his hand. He had brushed up against something hidden way down inside of her, and he beamed once he realized what he'd found. Knowing he'd hit the jackpot, he began to massage that place buried inside her. ""A woman's body is a very special thing, you know."" He observed, moving one of his hands back up her body and to her hard nipple and lightly pinching it. ""They can be pleasured in the most fascinating of ways. Different places on the body, that you'd never know even resembled an erogenous zone. But today, we don't care about other spots, do we?"" He moved his fingers faster inside of her, and she clenched around them, practically fucking his hand. He smirked, knowing what he had planned for his next move. He stopped his motions, leaving her breathless and disappointed and panting. He removed his fingers from her body and backed away, only to move closer to her head. ""You're awfully flushed, Bella. Maybe I should take your temperature again,"" he suggested, unbuckling his belt with one of his hands. She tried to keep eye contact, but failed when he dipped his hand into his pants and pulled out his impressive cock. She licked her lips, turned her head and opened her mouth, ready to take him. He stepped to her and thrust his hips forward. He placed his hands on the back of her head and guided his hard cock into her wet mouth. She moaned softly around the head of his dick, before sucking and licking it, trying to take all of into her. Realizing there was much more he wanted from her, he shuddered in enjoyment, but pulled away from her face after only a few minutes. ""What…where are you going?"" she inquired once he was free of her. ""Shhh…don't worry, Bella."" He patted her cheek and moved back between her legs. He tapped her knees and she shifted her butt to the edge of the table, before spreading her legs further apart to allow him plenty of room to maneuver. He ducked his head and ran his tongue over her pussy, first lightly over her outer lips, before running it over her clit. He did the same circuit, over and over again until she was completely pliant and wheezing out his name with every touch of his tongue. He pulled her clit into his mouth, sucking on it, until he felt her body close to convulsing. He released it, blew on it for good measure and stood back up. He moved his pants lower down on his body, stepping out of one of the legs. She placed her feet on the exam table, close to the edge and pushed her legs as far apart as they could go. He shot her one last look, as if challenging her to stop him, but she only nodded for him to continue. He ran the head of his dick around her outer lips and clit a few times before gently pushing inside of her. She whimpered when he was seated all the way in. ""Yes…"" he moaned, moving slowly, before gathering more speed. She thrust her hips up to meet him and he picked up his pace. ""Harder…"" she begged. ""Faster…more… I need…."" Her words incoherent, her body at his mercy. ""Please…please…please…"" He moved faster then, as their hips met thrust for thrust. Her orgasm hit her by surprise, and with a final cry, she clenched around him so tightly it caused his strokes to become erratic until he finally came as well. He slumped over her as their breathing went from panting to heavy until finally back to normal. He gave her breasts a few more licks and sucks before he pulled out and wiped his brow. ""You'll be pleased to hear you passed your examination,"" he said before pulling off his gloves and tossing them into the trash. ""Are you sure you didn't hit any bumps when you were in there, Doctor? The ones that shouldn't be there, I mean."" She coyly commented, batting her eyes. ""I can always check you again. Maybe a private consultation sometime? At my house of course. It's a more relaxed atmosphere. Not to mention private."" He nodded towards the exam room door. ""I agree we should be very thorough. After all, this is important."" She hopped off the table and walked to the chair holding her clothes. ""I'll see you later?"" she asked, pulling her satin panties back up her legs. ""I should be home by seven."" He looked at his watch and frowned. ""Shit, I'm running late. I've got to run. Next time, we'll need more time."" He smacked her ass, grabbed his stethoscope and left her to finish getting dressed. Bella discarded the paper from the exam table and checked to make sure she wasn't leaving anything behind that she shouldn't leave there. ""Bye, Shelly,"" she called, waving at her as she exited the clinic. ""Bye, Mrs. Cullen!"" Shelly shouted back. Hosts' Reminder: Remember to leave the entry some love by hitting the review button.

43,4,17,4-MaytoDecemberRomanceContest-17.txt,twilight,MaytoDecemberRomanceContest,"his beautiful face and her heart ached at the sight. ""You're sure Bella. Really, a 'forever' sure?"" he asked. She lifted her hand to run it gently along his cheek. She put that worry there. She wanted to brush his face into the gentle boy who slept next to her in the morning light. She needed to make him see, to help him understand. She grabbed her phone out of her bag and flipped it to her photos, handing it to him. ""This is who I am without you. This is the girl in the box,"" she said as he looked at a stranger with straight hair and conservative monochromatic clothes. Her make-up was a perfect mask that showcased the bored expression plastered on her face. Edward shook his head in denial. His beautiful bird … He could hardly reconcile the two. The colorless person in the photo was a mockery of his Little Bird, so vibrant and alive. This person was a modified version of what he had been running from for twenty years, plastic, vapid, social climbers. It broke his heart. ""Edward, I have lived my whole life as this girl,"" she pointed to the phone in his hand and kissed him sweetly, ""but with you, I can be me, the real me. I want a full, rich life with you . So, yes, I'm 'forever' sure. Please, let me love you back."" He swallowed and nodded, giving her one last squeeze. He stepped back, clearing his throat and ran his hand down his tie, ""It appears we are on the same page, Ms. Swan. I think we have a deal."" ""Deal,"" she stretched up to seal it with a kiss. He gave her the boyish grin she loved, then pulled away holding her hand. He took her luggage handle. ""And delete that damn picture,"" he shot over his shoulder. She smiled and picked up her purse, allowing herself to be towed into her future. ~o0o~ Brady met them in front of the terminal. ""It's good to see you again, Miss,"" he said, opening the car door for her. ""Were you in cahoots with this abduction?"" she scowled at him. ""Ma'am?"" He shot a quick look at his employer, ""Sir?"" ""Bella, stop teasing him,"" Edward smiled, as he handed Brady her luggage. She giggled, ""I'm sorry Brady. I come on my own free will, gladly even,"" she smiled. ""Well, that's good to hear,"" Brady smiled back with relief. ""Sir, the plane is on the tarmac and waiting,"" he said taking the luggage and redirecting his focus. ""Then spirit us away, Brady. I'm ready to be in the air,"" Edward said squeezing her hand. As they drove around the airport to the private flights, Edward held her hand rubbing his thumb across her knuckles and lifting their joined hands to kiss hers. She leaned in close to him and rubbed her hand over his. She couldn't bring herself to look at him. These new emotions were too raw, ran too deep. She felt as though her heart would burst. ""We're really doing this,"" she whispered looking at their joined hands. ""I've waited my whole life for you, Bella Swan, and I feel like it won't be real until we're in the air and I get to keep you. ""We're doing this,"" she smiled, meeting his eyes with confidence. ""Damn straight, we are,"" he said with conviction. He leaned as far as his seatbelt would allow, meeting her in the middle for a sweet kiss of solidarity. ~o0o~ At the airplane, Brady made short work of loading luggage. As Edward began to escort her to the stairs, Bella's phone rang. She froze, bringing the phone to her ear. ""You missed your flight, Isabella. Don't tell ... Seeing the fear on Bella's face, Edward held out his hand and winked. ""Mrs. Swan, Bella has made arrangements for alternate transportation,"" Edward interrupted her mid-rant. ""Who are you?"" she barked. Edward locked eyes with Bella and gave her his heart-stopping grin. ""I'm the guy she's hitching a ride with."" Edward took a deep breath as Bella laughed, smacking his shoulder and taking back the phone. ""I'm here, Mother."" ""Very irresponsible, Isabella, when are we to expect you home?"" Bella locked eyes with Edward again and smiled broadly. ""I am home, Mother."" As she took Edward's hand, she ended the call. ""We're doing this,"" he whispered conspiratorially, as they climbed the steps. Seated, she pushed up the arm between them and kissed her beautiful boy as the door was closed and locked. She felt overwhelmed again as a rush of feelings washed her away. She was so unused to allowing herself to feel or care; this new emotional freedom he inspired was like free falling. He loved her . She buried her face in his collar while he kissed her forehead. As they picked up speed, he brought their joined hands to his mouth, ""I get to keep my Little Bird,"" he whispered mainly to himself. ""And I get to keep my beautiful muse,"" she added with awe. As soon as the seatbelt sign was turned off, he unbuckled her and pulled her to him. ""We're going to be so good together, Baby,"" he whispered against her lips. She pulled back and smiled as she ran her hand down his handsome face. ""Damn straight, we are,"" she sighed. ""And Brady gets a raise,"" she added. They looked over to where Brady was sleeping with a copy of Vogue Italia draped across his chest. ""Brady gets a kidney if he wants,"" Edward said smiling at his friend and then back to his Bella, who he got to keep. Looking at his lovely Bella he knew, only a lifetime would be enough. They would negotiate from there. Hosts' Reminder: Remember to leave the entry some love by hitting the review button.

Her eyes nearly bugged out of her head. ""What things? And you love me? And you tell me that right after you tell me I'm ridi…"" Her words were cut off by a very determined pair of lips. There was silence for a moment, before he pulled away. Grabbing the hem of her t-shirt, he pulled it over her head with a remarkable efficiency of movement. ""Oh nice, no bra,"" he smirked. Before she had time to remark on that or anything else, he had tossed her onto the bed and was hovering over her, with a dangerously sexy look in his eyes. ""I love you, and I am now going to make love to you. Anything you want to say to that?"" She nodded. ""I love you. Now get on with the good stuff, please. My aunt and uncle will be home this evening. We're working on a deadline here."" He sniggered, before pulling off his own t-shirt. He was in remarkably good shape for a man of forty. Plus, the renovations he had been working on over the last four months had added definition to his muscles. Bella reached up to touch his chest. She had seen it once from her window, but being able to touch it, taste it… she was lost in her explorations, pushing him onto his back and randomly nipping, sucking and licking as she made her way over his torso, and down to his navel. Her hand dipped lower, cupping and teasing his hard length through the cotton of his sweatpants. He sat up, pulling her to him so that their bare torsos pressed together. Her nipples hardened into sharp nubs of sensation and she writhed against him, needing more friction. He soothed her, stroking the silken fall of her rich brown hair over her shoulder and down her back. Their lips met once again, in a soft kiss, then again, deeper, and sweeter than ever before. He lay her down and kissed her again, moving his fingers with feather-light touches, over the curves of her breasts, down her sides and back again. She stifled a moan as his fingers brushed against the sensitive skin of her belly. His hands grasped her hips firmly, as his thumbs traced feather light circles on her abdomen that had her squirming with want. ""More?"" he asked softly. ""More,"" she pleaded. The instant his fingers moved off her skin, she almost protested, until she realized that they had merely moved a few inches south, to skim under the waistband of her pajama bottoms. Her eyes closed in anticipation, as he pulled them off, leaving her covered only by her pink cotton bikini briefs. Her eyes shot open. Her pink cotton panties, that had a small hole or two near the waistband. She moaned, this time in mortification, and tried to turn over and hide under the pillows. Why could she not have worn sexy, non-holey lingerie? Why, God, why? A deep chuckle brought her back to the situation she had just been trying to hide from. He was laughing at her! ""Sweetheart, I'm not laughing at you,"" he said, with a wry grin. ""But I think you don't realize it's you that makes everything you wear sexy, not the other way round."" ""Huh? Did I say all that aloud? Oh great! Now you think I'm a crazy slob with torn underclothes. Just ignore me."" And with that, she buried her head back under the pillow, sticking her butt up and waving him away. A sharp sting on her backside had her gasping and facing him again. ""You stick your delectable ass up like that, and expect me to just walk away? Now come here so I can make you feel better,"" he demanded, pulling her over to straddle him, stroking and kneading her ass, and pulling down her hips against his, while dropping kisses across her torso. By the time he nuzzled her breasts, bringing first one and then the other to peaked perfection with his lips and tongue, she was well on her way to forgetting her own name, let alone what she may or may not have been wearing. His lips were kind of magical like that. ""So,"" he murmured from the vicinity of her navel, fingering the waistband of her panties. ""Are you very attached to these?"" ""No,"" she groaned. ""I'm throwing them away. In fact, I might have to clear out half my underwear drawer."" ""Hmmm, in that case..."" He stuck a finger in the tear and ripped the panties right off her. Before she had registered anything other than the slight sting where the material had pressed against her softness before it gave way, Edward was already soothing her with his soft lips. His tongue joined in, and he sampled her eagerly, a hand on her hips holding her down gently. For a while, her world was nothing but sensation, as his tongue traced the route to her own private nirvana. When she finally came down from her high, he licked his lips, picked up the torn scraps of pink cotton and said, ""I'll help you with that clearing out you were talking about. One pair of torn panties at a time."" She grinned at him. "" S'il vous plait , sweetheart.""

I come down to breakfast, pull you away from slaving over the hot stove for me, lift you onto the island, and devour you instead."" Bella attacks my mouth, and I take that as a sign she likes the idea. When I can, I push her backward and lay her out across the cool marble. She's a feast for a starving man. She watches me with barely open eyes as she rests one heel on the edge of the counter, offering herself to me. ""God, you're beautiful."" I take a moment to drink in the sight of her, committing it to memory. Bella reaches up and palms the side of my face. ""So are you. I've never really seen you without your glasses on before. Your eyes are so green. Gorgeous."" I lean over and nibble the flesh just below her belly button. And then my need takes over. I have to taste my goddess. I kiss and suck my way down between her thighs and growl when my tongue finally enters her. She's everything I dreamed about and more. So sweet. So wet. So fucking ready for me that I can't believe this is real. I feast on Bella until she's a writhing mess. She's actually trying to crawl away because I won't let her come again—not yet. I don't want this to end. ""Edward,"" she moans. ""Not yet, baby."" ""But, aahhh!"" She's so close. ""I have a fantasy too."" I lift my head just an inch away and miss her heat immediately. ""Tell me. I'll do whatever you ask."" She moans as my tongue pushes back inside her. ""You, me, ah,"" she tries to speak. I slow down my assault because I'm curious about how she imagined I'd take her. ""I'm standing bending over the oven, ah, ah."" She opens her eyes and looks at me. I stop and wait. ""And you fuck from behind. No warning. You just storm across the kitchen, yank my shorts down, and fuck me hard. Like you can't control your need for me. Please."" ""Fucking hell, woman. Yes!"" I pull her into my arms and whisk her around the other side of the island. Bella has a blissed-out smile plastered on her face. She's high from my tongue, and I feel like fucking Superman. She stumbles when I put her down, but I grab her before she falls. ""My legs are Jell-o thanks to you."" She turns around and steadies herself on the edge of the stove. ""Here."" She bends over, offering me herself again, and if I thought I was hard before, that's nothing to the strain on my zipper now. ""Like this. Just take me. Hard,"" she says over her shoulder. There is no need to ask me twice. I align our hips, unzip my pants, and sink straight in to the fucking hilt in one thrust. Heaven on fucking earth! Bella makes a kind of mewing sound and pushes back against me. Her heels make her hips the perfect height as I pump and grind into her center. She's a fucking dream. She wants this, she wants me, and not only me, but she's fantasized about me fucking her hard in my kitchen. ""Oh yeah, like that,"" she demands. I push harder and deeper, as fast as I can. ""Baby, I'm gonna come."" ""Me too. Fuck—"" And just when I can't hold on a second longer, Bella comes. She pulls me with her, and I let go, touching heaven. I collapse on the floor and drag her down with me in a tangle of arms and legs. She's half on my lap, half leaning against the cupboard. ""Edward Cullen,"" she pants, trying to get air. ""If I knew you could make me feel like that, I would have attacked you months ago."" She starts to giggle, and we both end up laughing on the floor. With what strength I have left, I maneuver her so she sitting on my lap, facing me. I push the tangle of hair over her shoulder and hold her face in my palms. She will forever be my kitchen goddess. She sits, with a healthy flush to her cheeks, grinning back me. What we just shared wasn't dirty, or lewd, or a crime because of our age difference. It was two people who care deeply for each other, sharing their innermost desires. The worry I had for us fades away as the realization hits me. Love doesn't see color or race or age or sex. Love just is, and it's a blessing and a gift. Fighting what I felt for her all those months didn't chase it away. If anything, it only made her all the more precious to me. She runs one finger down my cheek. ""Did that feel like a crime?"" I snort. ""No."" She smiles. ""It's like since you walked through my door, my life has only just begun. As though, I've been in a holding pattern waiting for you arrive."" ""Waiting for me to be a respectable age you mean."" We both laugh. Bella pulls one end of my bow tie, easing the strain around my neck. ""Fantasy turn out the way you wanted?"" I ask, grinning. ""Oh boy, did it ever. But I think it's about time I got to see what's under your gym shorts. Round two is definitely going to be naked. Agreed?"" ""Agreed."" I grab her around the waist and haul us both to our feet. Bending down, I pull her over my shoulder and head for the bedroom with her giggles of delight echoing through the house. What we just shared made my girl happy, and I'll do whatever it takes to make her this happy forever more. Hosts' Reminder: Remember to leave the entry some love by hitting the review button.

""I work two jobs to pay my rent, medical bills, student loans, and to help my mom. She's fine - just flighty and awful with money."" Another sip of wine and she's avoiding my eyes, but I can't tell if it's out of fear or because she's lying. ""You're in school?"" I ask and watch for her reaction. If there's one thing I've learned from gambling, it's how to spot a liar. ""No. I...um...had to drop out for medical reasons, which made my loans due.""

Believe me, I know,"" I say as I go to her and hold her tight. She lays her head on my chest like she did earlier, but I don't hold back now. I pull her body against mine and hold her tight. Feeling her nakedness against my own makes me hard and I'm so torn. I want to show her she could never be less of a woman to me, but she needs to be comforted, not fucked. She looks up at me and I use my already wet hands to wipe the last of the makeup from under her eyes. My touch makes her whimper and I can't help myself. I slowly touch her face, jaw, and neck, before moving my hand under the water to her breasts. She watches my face as I look at her body and I pray she can see how I want her just the same as before, if not more. The smooth curves of her waist and hips have me mesmerized. I feel the small lines that indent her skin where the garter belt was and I want to rub each one away. She kisses my chin and opens her legs like an invitation, asking me to show her. Making me prove that our pasts are behind us and we're moving on. I watch my hand move down her stomach and cup her pussy. She spreads her legs wider, wraps her fingers tightly around my dick, and begins stroking me up and down. I moan for her and push my first three fingers into her tight pussy. Pumping them in and out of her, I make sure to give her clit some friction, and she squeezes me harder. Moving in time with each other is exhilarating. I'm watching her thighs shake and hips thrust as she's watching my dick slide through her fist. Her movements slow and her thighs tense as she comes, breathing heavily against me. Bella moves off of me and tells me to stand up. I look at her in question she smiles at me and says, ""Now."" I stand and with force I didn't expect, she pushes my chest so I sit on the edge of the hot tub. Lips replace fingers and she's sucking as much of me into her mouth as she can. I brace myself and move her wet hair so I can watch. Her eyes are shut tight and she's humming as though she been waiting to do this for years. She sucks the head, strokes me roughly until I come, and licks me clean. I lift her up to me and kiss her lips. The cool night air quickly chills us both, so I pull her back in the water with me and lean back. Bella pours us both another glass of wine and straddles my lap. ""I've been thinking. You defied Aro, so you know he's going to be an unbearable prick to both of us and since your maid quit, maybe we could work something out."" ""When have you had time to think?"" I smirk and grab her ass. I'm freshly fucked, a little drunk, and emotionally worn thin - I'm exhausted. But her suggestion wakes me up. ""You're serious? You know I need a live-in maid, always on hand, and that I'm a picky bastard."" She nods and bites her lip. ""If it helps, my other job was housekeeping for Marcus at the hotel."" I want to tell her she's too young. There is this whole world out there for her, why should she spend it with me? But I can't bring myself to say the words. Instead I explain. ""I'll be here most of the time. I really only left to see you."" ""Good,"" she says with a seductive little grin. ""The Volturis are going to hate me,"" I say and we both smile wider. ""I hope you didn't suck Aro off to get hired."" ""You pig! Of course not. That's not why...' I pull her face to mine and kiss her. ""I'm kidding, but I will need to know what bills you have and how much you send your mom, alright?"" She nods and then holds me against her. ""Thank you, Edward. You won't regret this."" ""I know."" I smile at her and she reaches her palm up to my face as she smiles back. ""Now, back to making you come all night, since I just decided tomorrow is your day off.""

""That was—"" ""Pretty incredible"" Bella finished for him. She rubbed her hand distractedly on his chest. He kissed the top of her head. ""We've had sex twice, and it's been amazing but—"" ""We barely know each other. We can finish each other's sentences, so that must count for something,"" he added teasingly. ""I promise, I'm not some serial killer."" ""I didn't promise any such thing."" Bella tickled his side. He made her feel so young again. ""I'm kind of evil."" He answered by flipping Bella over and showering her face with little kisses. Bella laughingly shrieked, ""Hey now!"" His eyes were bright as he looked down at her with a smile. ""I feel like I'm older than my age. I've been designing and selling apps for years now. I could support you if I wanted."" ""Apps?"" ""Yeah. Applications for devices like iPads. I know back in your day those things didn't exist—"" he began. Bella put her hand over his mouth. ""I know what an app is, smart ass. I wasn't born in the Renaissance!"" Edward pulled away from her hand. ""I'm joking. What I'm trying to say is you look and act young. I act old. We balance each other out."" ""How do you know that for sure? This is me being older and practical. All I know is that you're almost finished with college, and I'm guessing a wizard with computers."" She stroked his face. Life throws a person curve balls, and after Jacob's betrayal, Bella learned to be wary. ""We take the weekend and learn about each other. I don't know why I feel so strongly for you like this, but I want to know everything that makes you Bella. Let's go out on dates and talk. See where this goes."" There is a time in everyone's life that a risk should be taken. Bella knew that nothing in this world was certain, but if she didn't try, it would be a regret that would haunt her forever. ""Let's try,"" she told him, trying to appear to be brave. ""I guess we should get dressed."" He gave a little growl. ""Who said I was going to let you get dressed?"" Bella's face lit up with mirth. This was what happiness felt like. It was definitely worth the risk. XXXXXX Edward chased the children down the beach. Squeals of laughter could be heard floating on the breeze. Jasper was ready to catch them on the other end. They were supposed to be playing football, but the ball had been long forgotten in the sand. It was more fun playing chase. ""You two don't seem so different in age. I mean I know, but others wouldn't notice unless you told them,"" Alice pointed out. The women were lounging on beach chairs and drinking wine coolers. Their annual beach vacation now had a new member in Edward. ""Hasn't been an issue. My dad calls him kiddo. I think it might be a term of affection, but Dad won't own up to it,"" Bella said as Edward waved to her. All the children tackled him to the ground. The whole group started laughing. ""Ouch!"" Alice giggled. Jasper and Edward had grown into close friends. It was nice for all of them after the loss of Jacob. ""Is asshole being nicer?"" ""Jacob will never be nice to Edward. At least, he's being civil now. Claire being knocked up has helped."" ""He wants you back. Jacob has always wanted what he can't have,"" Alice pointed out with a frown. Bella shrugged. ""He can want a lot of things, Al. It isn't going to happen. I'm happier with Edward."" ""I can hear wedding bells!"" Alice held up her wine cooler in the air. ""Edward, you need to make Bell an honest wo—"" ""Shut it, Alice!"" Bella's hand went on her friend's mouth. Untangling himself from children, Edward ran up to the ladies. He got down on his knees in front of Bella. ""I heard you need to settle down. Need a husband. Right, Alice?"" He took her hand, and Bella put her nose against his. ""If you ask me to marry you on the beach when I'm sweaty and gross, I won't say yes, and you'll be cut off."" ""Oh, I'll be asking you when you're sweaty. The difference is you'll be naked and under me,"" he stated and kissed her on the nose. ""I was just confirming with Alice that you need me as a husband."" Alice started fanning herself with her book. ""It's getting hot out here. We need some ice cream."" Edward stood and wiped sand off his knees. ""Great idea, Alice! I already talked with Jasper, and you two are watching all the kids tonight. Bella and I will be getting a carton of ice cream and enjoying it on the beach."" ""Ice cream on the beach?"" Bella asked. ""Sounds fun!"" He leaned down and said sweetly, ""It's going to be even more fun when I eat it from between your legs."" ""You lucky bitch,"" Alice stated in awe as Edward jogged away. ""Yes, I am."" Without a doubt, Bella found love with a younger man. She knew if he decided to ask her tonight to marry him while she was sticky, sweaty, and covered in sand, her answer would be yes. Age was just a number. Love was made of so many more important things. Personality, friendship, and attraction to name a few. As Bella watched Edward round up the kids, she knew she had found all those things and more with him. If life was a series of sketches that created a picture. What she now had with Edward was her masterpiece. Hosts' Reminder: Remember to leave the entry some love by hitting the review button.

""I want you so much, baby. If I hurt you, or you need me to slow down, just say so, okay?"" ""Not slow. I want you hard, fast and deep,"" she moans out. ""Oh, baby, no worries, I got plenty of time to show you more than hard and fast, but it will always be deep with me,"" I say as I thrust forward and sink into her fully. I don't move, but I can feel the spasms of her pussy around my cock. I've never been so thankful of having a release in my pants as I am now. It will help me hold off, so I can make her come around my dick. I want to thrust, but I wait until I know her body is ready. When I feel her relax a little, I reach between us and rub her clit. She moans and wraps her legs around my torso. I know now I can let it go and I do. I push and pull myself from within her body, as she cries out for more. I lean up on my knees and spread her legs more, pushing her knees to her sides. I watch as I thrust and my cock disappears into her. This time when her muscles retract and start to pulsate I continue to thrust hard into her. She calls out my name and is chanting things that are not making sense. I grind against her while fully encased inside her as her orgasm takes over her senses. I have no idea how I've managed to last this long, because my groin aches for its release. ""Give me it, Edward; I want you to give it to me."" ""Baby, seeing you come gives me more satisfaction than you even realize, there's no way I wouldn't share mine with you."" I begin to thrust into her again and her hands move to my hair. Pulling me down she kisses me and within three strokes I'm seeing spots as my body convulses in pleasure. Unsure of how we got there, but I'm on my back and she is now lying on my chest. I play with her hair as her head rests on my chest. We lie here just touching and holding each other. ""What happens now?"" she asks me after a few minutes goes by. ""Now, I take you on dates. After the third, we'll tell each other we're in love. You'll start to sleep over here with me on a regular basis. After six months, I'll ask you to marry me. You'll say it's too soon, but I'll be so romantic you can't say no . Then we'll get married and live happily ever after."" ""You have it all worked out, don't you?"" Bella asks as she chuckles. ""I do."" ""One problem,"" she states. ""Oh, yeah, what's that?"" I ask and she sits up a little looking down at me. ""I'm already in love with you."" I swallow – I knew that she had strong feelings for me, but I never knew she felt the way I did. ""Good, because I'm in love with you, too,"" I say pulling her head down to kiss her. ""Do you think your family will be okay with us?"" Bella asks sounding worried. ""Yes, my brother and dad love you."" ""I know, Dr. Mc-take-my-panties-off-me loves me, but what about Jasper and Emmett?"" ""Jasper and Emmett like you – trust me."" I nod but stop and tilt my head. ""What's the story with that nickname for my father?"" ""I swore I wouldn't tell."" ""Tell me,"" I say tickling her. ""Shit, stop, I'm really ticklish."" I shake my head at her. ""Tell me?"" ""Okay, okay,"" Bella says and I stop, looking at her. ""You can't say anything to him or anyone else for that matter."" ""Come on and tell me,"" I say impatiently. ""Promise?"" ""I promise,"" I say as Bella narrows her eyes at me. ""I was on my way home, and he was saying goodbye to me by the hospital door. Suddenly, this man ran in yelling that his wife was in the cab outside having their baby. Carlisle grabbed gloves and rushed out to the cab. Lifts the lady's dress and begins to take off her panties. Then he suddenly noticed that there are a couple of cabs and he was in the wrong one. The nurses were all laughing, and ever since then they've been calling him that."" I just look at Bella in shock and then burst out laughing. I look at Bella pushing her hair out the way. ""Have dinner with me? No – in fact have dinner, spend the night, and let me take you out for breakfast tomorrow."" Bella nods and I move off the bed, and get her the shirt I threw on the floor earlier. I dispose of the now droopy condom, and pull on some boxers and a t-shirt and turn to look at Bella. She's still on my bed, looking sexy in my shirt. I move back to the bed kissing her, as my cock again springs to life. ""Come on, or he's never letting you leave this room."" ""Maybe I don't want to leave. Maybe I've earned a detention, after all I was hot for teacher and I had my wicked way with him."" ""Well, your teacher sure is hot for the cute little library assistant, so maybe she can teach him something."" ""You can count on that,"" she flirts. ""So you think you can teach this old dog a new trick?"" ""Maybe,"" she says dropping to her knees in front of me and pulling down my boxers.

I can't know for sure things would be this relaxed were we to go back home this way, but for now, here, it feels right. After dinner, Angela and Ben disappear. Edward helps me clear the table and load the dishwasher as we trade stories about our day. He's easy to talk to, smart and unassuming. The only thing better than a boy as hot as he is is one who's got the brains and personality to back it up…and he does. He so does. My concerns about us being in different life stages might not have been inaccurate, but it's definitely beginning to seem irrelevant. Edward follows me to my room and sits on my bed, watching as I shed my layers, draw my curtains shut, turn a lamp on. He grabs me as I pass by, pulling me to stand between his legs. ""You're so pretty,"" he says quietly, watching his hand as he combs it through my hair. It's funny: he's such a stud with other girls but with me, he wavers between confidence and shyness. It's appealing, and it reminds me to be careful with him. His feelings might run deeper than I realize. ""Thanks,"" I say, leaning forward to plant a little kiss on his lips. He tries to deepen it, but I pull back playfully. ""So are you. I always knew you'd be a knockout."" He smiles crookedly. ""Yeah?"" I nod, touching his hair. There's no going back now, I don't think. I don't want to. ""I like this,"" he whispers, settling his hands on my hips. I'm in a dress today, one of the last few before the rapidly cooling days of fall will render it impossible to wear again. There is a chill, though, hence my grey leggings. Gazing into my eyes, Edward runs his hands up my thighs and falters. A smile breaks out as he realizes my leggings are actually thigh highs. ""So hot,"" he whispers, yanking me close to kiss. I lick his lips and he lets me in, kissing me deeper as his hands drift higher, widening my stance so his fingers can play where he wants them to. ""This okay?"" ""Mhm."" Grasping his shoulders, I exhale quietly, shaking as he touches me, gently and then with authority. Now I'm the one moaning into his mouth, my knees weak as he fingers me into an orgasm. I close my eyes as I recover, letting him kiss my neck. ""You look so good, Bella,"" he says, eyes on my chest as he lifts my dress off. I help him with my bra and then with his shirt, appreciating the muscled plane of his chest. Kneeling, I unbuckle his pants and pull them down, boxers too, finally doing what I've been thinking about for days. ""Oh…oh…yeah…I…I…"" He can't even formulate a sentence. I fit as much of him into my mouth as I can, using my hand for everything else. He rests his hand on my head, his mouth half open, eyes half closed. His pleasure actually, literally, makes me wet, so without further adieu I rise and take the rest of my clothing off. ""Hey,"" he says, reaching for me. ""If we…do this, it's not a quick fuck for me. You need to know it's…"" He shakes his head, swallowing. ""I want you, yeah, but I want to be with you."" ""I know."" I nod, wrapping my arms around him, kissing his ear. Our bodies are warm, pressed together without clothes for the first time. It gives me goosebumps. ""I want to be with you, too."" He rests his hands hesitantly on my behind. ""I mean - "" ""I know what you mean."" I smile at his earnestness and back up a bit so I can see his face. ""And I'm on the same page."" Distracted by my breasts, he leans forward, kissing each one. ""Good. Because…"" He draws a nipple into my mouth. It feels so good I sigh, my head falling back. Edward stops, fumbling for his wallet. ""You have to tell me what you like,"" he says, cheeks flushed with want. ""I will,"" I promise, but I might not have to. He rolls a condom on and starts to gentle me on to my back, but I push him off and straddle him instead, rubbing myself back and forth over his erection. Eventually he grits his teeth and holds me still, our gazes locked as he enters me. It's hard to believe this is happening, but I want it; I want him. I more than want him; I might even be a little in with love him. After taking a moment to adjust, I start to move, rolling my hips over him. It's slow at first, feeling every inch of him inside of me, enjoying his expressions as he enjoys the view. He squeezes my breasts, rolling my nipples between his fingers, feeding my arousal as I ride him. Resting my hands on his thighs behind me, I move faster, chasing completion until it crashes over me, ripping out of me with a sharp cry. Before I can come down, Edward sits up, flipping me over, and starts to drive into me with a force that bruises. I hold on tight, grabbing his face so that I can kiss him. I swear I can feel him get harder, more rigid, and he comes with a grunt and several quick, sharp thrusts. Sweat dampens his hair, his brow, as he gazes down with something like wonder and supreme satisfaction. Using both my arms and my legs, I pull him down, craving his weight. ""You were my first wet dream,"" he whispers, mouth at my ear. ""But that…that was so much better."" Hosts' Reminder: Remember to leave the entry some love by hitting the review button.

50,4,9,4-MaytoDecemberRomanceContest-9.txt,twilight,MaytoDecemberRomanceContest,"Bella wasn't into the idea of having servants, she knew where everything was kept. Bella figured he wouldn't miss the antiques she'd collected over time or the vases that she adored. As she walked away, she'd peeked over her shoulder one last time at the house that only held ghostly memories of the two people she once knew. She had to remind herself that the place wasn't solely filled with unpleasant experiences. It was where she'd met the man who saved her from falling into an eternal state of despair. She often wondered where he was. Maybe, he was in a relationship. A sad smile tugged at her lips as she felt a bittersweet emotion overwhelm her. She thought about Edward's words, remembering the clarity of his thoughts as if their love affair had only begun yesterday. "" But you don't know if something's a mistake until you see the consequences later. By then, it might be too late. You could have stopped something terrific."" She wondered if she was too late. After paying the driver and hopping out of the vehicle, Bella walked into the building of the independent auction house. Bella didn't always sell her paintings in this manner. Many artists preferred not to show numerous pieces of their work at one time; fearing the value would be lowered due to the abundance. Instead, she earned money through private commissions. Bella opened the glass door, walking into the exhibition but also getting a side-peek of the main hall where rows of seats were situated. On the stage, different paintings that were to be sold would be displayed next to the auctioneer. ""Miss. Swan,"" a voice called. Bella turned around to see James Napre walking towards her. His white hair was gelled back as his blue eyes sparkled underneath the ceiling lights. ""We've just finished the exhibition for the guests,"" he said excitedly. ""It'll be starting soon."" Bella smiled as he led her to the main hall, motioning for her to sit in the front row with several people she already knew. She talked to a few who corresponded with her from the gallery as they told her just how stunning her art was. Bella blushed as she accepted their compliments. She wished she could thank the inspiration himself. In a matter of minutes, the auction was underway, with many of the paintings being sold for a couple of thousands. She felt her nerves spike when her artwork was brought to the stand. It was a piece that had been extensively shown in the gallery and had garnered a lot of attention through the competition Bella had won. ""Painted in oil on canvas, Bella Swan's painting depicts fragments of a human body in its surrealist context. Standing at thirty by forty inches, this phenomenal artwork will be sure to make bothart lovers and dealers happy. Half the sum will be donated to the International Child Art Foundation . Starting price at one thousand."" Bella looked around the room where people held paddles, ready to bid. ""The woman in front, fifteen hundred. On my left, two thousand. Two thousand, five hundred to the gentleman at the back. Three thousand, going at three thousand."" The auctioneer pointed the tip of his hand at someone in the back. ""Four thousand ... Five thousand. Six. Seven. We are looking at seven thousand for the lady on the right. Gentleman on my left, eight thousand."" Quiet chattering echoed as people discussed among themselves. ""Eight thousand, five hundred. Nine thousand, to the gentleman at the back. Going at nine thousand."" Bella held her breath as the murmurs buzzed in her ears. ""To the gentleman in the far corner. Going once. Twice."" She arched her head to see who the potential buyer was. Through the sea of people who were sitting down and conversing with each other, she couldn't see that far back. ""Sold to number eighty-nine, the gentleman at the back."" Applause was given for the successful sale as Bella was kissed on the cheek by beaming women. After the auctioneer had thanked the participants for joining him today, there was a commotion of people starting to make their way to the exit, and others staying behind to discuss the events of the day. ""Kate, isn't this simply superb? Miss. Swan's techniques are astonishing,"" James said as they walked onto the stage, towards the painting. ""Did you see who bought it, Bella?"" Kate asked her as they faced the surrealist work. ""No, I didn't-"" ""Ah, eighty-nine! Hello, Mr. Cullen,"" James said, turning around to greet the purchaser. She felt time move a little slower. She felt the world tilt a little further. She felt a kaleidoscope of butterflies flutter into her stomach. ""Hello Edward, I'm Kate Parker. Oh, and this is the artist herself, Bella Swan."" She turned around slowly, until she saw the shade of green she knew she could never forget. Every time she saw the friendly, little Cuban Emerald, she thought of him. And every time she worked on that painting, she felt a little closer to a presence that was never there. The corners of his lips curled, into a shy, boyish smile. One that made her heart beat like a wild hummingbird, soaring through the grassy wilderness. From their two weeks together, to their two years apart, she knew Inspiration would always be with her. So she smiled, not listening to the gentle voices around her. ""What do you think of the painting, Mr. Cullen? It's rather-"" As he stared into her eyes with a tender look that reignited all the hope in her body, she felt a tremble in her bones. Not because she was afraid. But because she was brave .

""Meet me somewhere. Tonight."" It's not a question. Bella exhales deeply, her chin drops and she chews at her bottom lip. The blood that was violently swooshing through my veins slows. I see something in her eyes, and the hope I had a few seconds ago wanes. My arms fall from her waist, and I start to back away. My hand grips the doorknob and I'm about to turn it when she finally nods and my fucking heart beats once again. ""The park? Text me when you can get away, and I'll meet you there."" I bend down, capturing her lips once more with mine. ""Vinyl."" I tip her chin up so she's looking directly into my eyes. ""See you soon."" . . . Hours pass slowly, and I start losing hope in the anticipated text message. I mull over the kiss, the touches and the way Bella looked in my arms. The energy of the moment has me gasping to catch a breath. ""Fuck."" I rip my t-shirt off and grab for my headphones, so I can go for a run. I need to clear my head, pound the pavement and push the fact that Bella probably isn't going to contact me, out of my mind. When I leave the house, I contemplate taking the same route as Emmett and I jog in the morning, but I think better of it since it will take me by the Whitlock's. I don't trust myself not to stop and throw pebbles at her bedroom window or knock at her door, beg her to meet me and to give me, us, a chance. Not even when Tanya and I split did I feel the desperation I'm feeling right now. The longing to touch Bella is too much, and I ball my fists and pump my arms faster, sprinting, pushing myself harder than I ever have. I end up at the park. I pull the headphones off my ears, letting them rest around my neck and walk in the dark over the freshly cut grass, circling the park until my heart rate returns to normal. I'm acting emo and shit, so I need to go home and forget about what could have been. I'm about to leave when I notice Bella's convertible in the parking lot. I quickly grab for my phone and check for missed calls or texts, but there aren't any. The glow of Bella's phone illuminates her face, and I wonder if she's debating whether or not to contact me? I take a seat on a bench in a darkly-shadowed area of the park. My view is perfect, but unless Bella's looking for me, she won't notice I'm here. I grip my phone in my hand, willing it to ping or ring and let me know she wants to meet. But the phone does neither, and after five minutes the little shred of hope seeing her here gave me is snuffed out. I sigh, resigned to the fact that Bella can't or won't take the chance on us becoming something wonderful. I stand and start to pull my headphones back on my ears when my phone starts playing the song ' Wonderful Tonight' , and the photo I secretly snapped of Bella laughing lights up the screen. ""Hey."" ""Hi."" Her voice is soft and sweet. ""About time, Vinyl."" I tease, but neither of us laughs. I watch as she drags her fingers through the front of her hair. ""I um. I didn't know if I should call."" ""You had me worried."" My legs feel weak, and I decide to sit back down. ""You letting me down easy? Or …"" I rub my hand over my face before continuing. ""You gonna meet me tonight?"" ""I don't know."" ""Tell me something."" The sound of her taking a deep breath doesn't ease my mind. It puts more doubt out there and my chest tightens. ""Why'd you drive to the park if you don't wanna see me?"" Her breath hitches, and she looks around, scanning the desolate grounds. ""How'd you know?"" ""I went for a run."" I stand. ""Look straight ahead."" Her head quickly snaps forward, and I lift my hand, unsure if she can see me because she doesn't wave back. Silence lingers, and for a minute, I think she ended our call. Finally, I hear her suck in a breath and she speaks. ""I see you."" ""Do you really wanna see me? Or should I go on home?"" I can't go toward her car until she answers my question. ""God, yes, I want to see you. I fucking always want to see you. That's the problem."" ""That doesn't seem like a problem. It actually sounds pretty fucking good."" ""Edward, I'm afraid."" ""Afraid of me?"" I see her shake her head, and this time I start walking. ""Yes. I mean, no. I'm afraid of you leaving."" ""I won't."" ""You will. You're young."" I pick up my pace, jogging until I'm standing just a few feet in front of her car. I deliberately raise my phone and hit end on the call, all without removing my eyes from hers. The moonlight captures Bella's beauty, holding her in the softness of its illumination. Her eyes sparkle like stars when she tips her head up to greet me, and I see tears making them glisten. I toss my phone in the car and open her door. I squat down next to her, and she swivels in her seat. ""You have dreams,"" she says sadly. My hands cup her face, and I bring her lips close to mine.

A flicker of relief crosses his face but also realization. ""Eighteen?"" ""Yep."" ""I don't care. It doesn't matter to me."" ""I can't stay. James will be looking for me. He knows I was with you last night."" ""I knew who you were. Even before you approached me."" I should be shocked, but I'm not. Something told me that he knew. ""How did you know?"" ""My sister, Rose."" ""The woman you were standing next to most of the night?"" ""Yes. She has a friend who knows James."" The way he chooses his words tells me that whoever Rose's friend is, it's someone James has been with before. ""Rose warned me. She saw the two of you together right before you approached me."" ""Why did you dance with me?"" ""I told you. I wanted more of your company."" ""But you knew what I was there for! Why would you welcome trouble?"" He laughs, and unlike mine from earlier, his is full of humor and bewilderment. ""Oh, Isabella. We don't always want what's easy… or good. And who's truly to say what's good for us?"" The mischief in his eyes makes me want to do ungodly things to him. ""I stole seven hundred and thirty-four dollars from you,"" I blurt out, trying to get everything out in the open, make him realize he doesn't want me so that I can be on my way. ""I know."" We sit there for a moment, each of us absorbing the last five minutes worth of conversation. ""I don't want to let you go."" Edward's voice is low, for only me to hear. ""I just found you."" ""I'm not good for you. You don't want me. I'll only bring you trouble."" ""Maybe a little trouble is what I need."" ""I'm scared."" ""Of what? Who? James?"" His tone rises, and I see the fury behind his words. Mr. Cullen is used to getting what he wants. ""You have no idea what he's capable of. I don't fully understand what he's capable of, which makes him even more frightening. And what if he uses all of the tapes he has against me? I could go to jail! I think I'm most scared of that."" The last sentence comes out in a whisper, because it is one of my biggest fears… turning out like my father. I never wanted a life of crime. ""Let me help you. Please."" ""I don't know what to do."" My eyes begin to sting with tears, and my throat hurts from holding back my emotions. ""Let me handle James. Then, when the coast is clear, you can come back and stay with me."" ""Why do you want to do this? This isn't your problem. If anything, you should be furious at me for stealing from you."" I wipe my nose on the sleeve of Edward's coat, unable to stop myself from crying. ""I want you. I can't explain it, but I've felt drawn to you from the second I laid eyes on you."" I don't know in what capacity he's speaking of, but the fact that he would want me at all breaks my heart even further. Nobody has ever wanted me. ""What time does your bus leave?"" ""At six o'clock."" ""Where are you going?"" ""Phoenix."" ""Why Phoenix?"" ""I don't know."" I shrug. ""I've been there before. It wasn't so bad."" Edward stands up and pulls me up with him. His hands gather the belt of his coat and he ties it tightly around my waist. ""How much money do you have?"" ""Five hundred seventy-nine dollars. Well, seventy-two. I bought a sandwich."" His smile is sad but still stunning. Reaching into his back pocket, he pulls out a cell phone and a credit card. ""Use this for emergencies,"" he says, handing me the card. ""And answer this when it rings."" He passes me the phone. ""I'll change the number on it, and I'll be the only one who knows it. Call me when you get to Phoenix. I'll book you a hotel and have a car meet you at the bus station."" I don't know what to say. Once again, he's rendered me speechless, except this time it's because of his generosity and kindness. The tears are consistently flowing down my cheeks now, and he reaches up and wipes them away. ""Everything's going to be OK. You'll see."" ""I don't think I can accept this… How would I…"" I stutter and stumble over my words and thoughts. ""Don't overthink this, Isabella. I'm a firm believer in taking chances, and you're a chance worth taking. If I let you leave with no way of knowing whether you're safe or not… or if I'll ever see you again… it would kill me. So, think of it as doing a favor for me."" I laugh through my tears, because his reasoning is ridiculous… and beautiful, just like him. I reach up, claiming his lips with mine and putting all of the gratitude and promise I can into it. It feels so strange. Twenty-four hours ago, he was a stranger who only existed on paper, and now, he suddenly means more to me than anyone else in the world. When I climb onto the bus, I hurry to the seat farthest in the back and move over to the window. Placing my hand on the glass, I tell him goodbye, hoping that this won't be the last time I see him, but if it is, knowing I'll never be the same because of him.

""I just realized that my mom's boyfriend is younger than you."" ""Really?"" ""Yeah, she's been dating this guy Phil; he's barely thirty."" ""Wow, hmm, okay then,"" I said. ""Is that one of the reasons you wanted to move away?"" ""Partly. My mom hasn't been the most involved parent since my dad died ten years ago. She's very selfish and rarely cared what I was up to. So I busted my ass in school so I could get a scholarship and it paid off. I'm here on a full ride, another reason I got a single room. I don't care if I ever go back to Phoenix."" ""Seattle can be your new home."" I kissed her lips softly. ""I can be your new home."" ""That sounds nice,"" she stated. ""I've never felt like I had real home."" ""Well, you do now,"" I told her. She nestled in closer to me and then sighed. I could tell there was something on her mind. ""What is it?"" I asked. She didn't respond. ""Come on Bella, you can tell me anything. I think we've established that."" ""I guess, I was just wondering if you were satisfied with me?"" I felt her face heating up as she spoke. I turned us so she was again on her back and I was hovering over her. I leaned down and kissed her forehead, then her nose, then her lips. ""I can't even begin to tell you how good that was; how amazing you felt. You did more than satisfy me. I don't think I ever came so hard in my life, it was perfect."" ""Really?"" she questioned. ""I didn't really know what I was doing."" ""You were perfect, and yes really,"" I whispered against her lips. ""This was so unexpected, but it was the best unexpected thing to ever happen to me. I can't tell how long I've waited for you."" One Month Later. My alarm woke me up at six a.m. and when I opened my eyes, I smiled at the familiar sight that was next to me. Bella was sound asleep and breathing evenly. I loved watching her sleep, especially when she was naked. She was lying on her side, facing me, the sheet was draped over her hip and her arms mostly covered her breasts, but I could see the outline of them. She'd become such a big part of my life over the past month. She spent more and more time at my condo; it seemed the only time she was at her dorm was if she had a project due or an exam to study for. However, for the most part she was here. I'd even given her a couple drawers my dresser and space in my closet. I never wanted to be without her; she was in my life and that was where I wanted her to stay. I lightly kissed her forehead and quietly got out of bed. I used the bathroom and then went to the kitchen in search of coffee. Sitting at the table, sipping my coffee, I sighed when I heard my phone vibrating. ""Good morning, little sister,"" I said. ""Morning, Edward,"" she replied. ""How's it going?"" ""It's going well, thanks. How are Jasper and the kids?"" ""Everyone is well,"" she answered. ""So Edward, it's been a while since I harassed you... and I'm just going to say that Jasper has this girl that works in his..."" ""No, Alice."" I cut her off. ""Edward, come the hell on, you're never going to meet anyone with that attitude,"" she barked. ""Alice, I'm saying no because it just so happens, that I did meet someone, all on my own, thank you very much."" ""You did?"" ""I did, and I couldn't be happier."" ""Well color me happy,"" Alice cheered. ""What's her name?"" ""Her name is Bella."" ""When do I get to meet her?"" ""Soon Alice."" ""Oh, come on Edward,"" she argued. ""You have to give me something here."" Just then, I looked up and saw Bella come into the kitchen. She was wearing the white button down shirt that I had worn the previous night. Last I saw it, it was lying on the bedroom floor, and now it covered her naked body. My mouth ran dry. ""Uh Alice, I've gotta go."" ""Edward..."" ""Bye, Alice."" I hung up the phone, raked my eyes over Bella's body, then cleared my throat. ""I didn't mean to wake you, but fuck me, I'm glad I did. You look hot in my shirt, babe."" ""I woke up and you were gone,"" she pouted. She walked over toward me and straddled my lap. I gasped when I realized she wasn't wearing any panties, and she was wet. I could feel her through the cotton of my boxers and it instantly made me hard. ""I was cold, care to warm me up?"" I ran my hands up her bare thighs and rested them on her hips. I then moved my hands up under the shirt, and cupped her breasts. ""I'd love to warm you up."" I felt her pulling at the waistband of my boxers, so I moved my hands from her breasts and helped her free my cock. ""What about work?"" she asked. ""Aren't you going to be late?"" ""My first appointment isn't until ten."" ""What a coincidence, my first class isn't until ten."" ""See? We're made for each other,"" I said, kissing her hard on her mouth. She then rose up and lowered herself down onto my cock, taking me all the way inside her. ""We... ah, God, fit well together too,"" she grunted and closed her eyes. ""Never better,"" I groaned. ""I love you so much, Bella."" ""I love you, too."" Hosts' Reminder: Remember to leave the entry some love by hitting the review button.

He leaned his mouth over and whispered in my ear, ""How long has it been?"" ""Five years."" I admitted. He flashed me a sexy smile. ""Well then, my beautiful librarian, don't you think it's about time?"" Lust overcame me and I nodded my head. I wanted him so badly. He pulled me closer to the edge of the couch and kneeled on the floor in front of me. His fingers slid under my sweater, pushed my bra strap down and lifted my breast out of the cup of my bra. His fingertips teased my nipple which immediately hardened. My eyes closed and I leaned my head back, breathing deep. I felt his hands tug on the bottom of my sweater, before he lifted it off over my head, then he released the hooks on my bra, freeing my breasts from their confinement. I shivered from the chill in the room and he covered me with both of his hands, massaging, gently squeezing and pushing my breasts together. I looked up at his face; seeing his eyes full of lust and focused directly on my stiff peaks. He leaned forward and gave me a sensual, wet kiss on the lips before dipping his head lower. His lips lightly grazed the tips of my nipples, and then planted gentle kisses around the fullness of my breasts, bringing me to heightened desire. His hot mouth surrounded first one nipple and then the next; gently sucking with his lips while swirling his tongue around each hardened peak. The heat between my legs increased and one hand slid down to stroke my panties underneath my skirt. I heard him groan as his fingers felt the moistness there. I reached my hand out to unzip his pants and began stoking his hardness. Our breathing quickened as we caressed each other. I watched him through hazy eyes as his soft hands moved against my skin. Edward stood up and kneeled onto the couch in front of me. I made eye contact with him briefly before taking him into my mouth and swirling my tongue around his swollen tip. I hollowed my cheeks, applying steady pressure as my head bobbed up and down. His breathing was ragged and I was even more aroused at the raspy sounds he was making. I moved hungrily against him, loving the way he felt in my mouth; so long, thick, hard and smooth. Suddenly I felt a sense of urgency sparking around us. Seconds later Edward slipped himself out of my mouth and pulled his pants all the way down. He smirked sexily at me, guiding me onto my back against the couch cushions. Moving swiftly, he slid his hands under my skirt, and slipped my panties off, flinging them across the room. I smiled up at him in anticipation, noticing intense desire in his eyes as he gazed down at me. He leaned closer, teasing between my moist lips with the tip of his eager erection. My hips writhed anxiously under him. The anticipation of feeling a man, especially this incredibly sexy, twenty five year old, inside me for the first time made my breath hitch in my throat. He entered me slowly and my tightness melted around his hardness. I could feel my lips stretching, the deeper he pushed. He started pumping, gently at first, giving me time to get acclimated to his size. My wetness increased and I rotated my hips in sync with his thrusting. He stroked my hair away from my shoulder, and leaned over, kissing my neck. ""You feel so good,"" I whispered. ""Do I feel good to you too?"" He nodded, eyes closed in concentration. ""Too good,"" he gasped. ""Hold still just a little. I want to savor this feeling as long as possible."" He set a slower, steady pace; gliding in and out and driving me closer to orgasm. There was a hot, pulsating feeling building from the pit of my stomach, radiating down to my toes. My core was on fire. I spread my legs a bit further to allow him more room to move. My inner walls began to spasm. I felt like a tightly coiled spring, ready to release any second. He thrusted into me faster, deeper; pumping hard into my sensitive channel. I heard his voice become hoarse, his breathing ragged. All at once my climax hit me in rippling shockwaves as he throbbed into me, leaving me dripping with his hot juices. We sat side by side on the bench outside of the library. The sun was shining through the clouds as we said our goodbyes. The memories of this unbelievable affair would be with me forever. This man had made me feel things I had never felt and for that I would always be grateful. I stood up and gave Edward a tight hug, then pressed my lips to his. ""I'm so thankful for the time we had together."" ""I am too. I'm sorry it ended so quickly…Or maybe I'm sorry it didn't start sooner."" Edward said sincerely. He gave me a chaste kiss and opened his car door before climbing in and starting the ignition. He waved through the car window as he pulled away. I waved back and once he was out of sight, I took out the box he had given me again. The shiny metal glistened in the sunlight and as I opened the locket and admired the tiny picture of Edward and I smiling. Beside it, the words were printed in tiny script ""To my Naughty Librarian: Although love and lust often don't keep the same company, for us they did.""

She teases as I start sucking on her neck. ""Oh really. You in a hurry little girl?"" Rubbing my cock in her warm heat, I teasingly bite her bottom lip. My mouth captures her lips and our tongues fight for dominance. I push into her hard and we both groan enjoying the feeling of being connected. Her legs open wider as I practically pull all the way out and then thrust back into her. Hard. Pulling one of her legs over my hip, I start fucking her fast enjoying every push and pull. My head burrows into her neck taking in her intoxicating scent. ""You feel so fucking good, Baby. So tight."" I breathe into her neck. ""Don't you fucking stop. Don't ever fucking stop!"" She yells out. I sit up taking both of her legs in each of my arms and ramming into her as I stand on my knees. ""Never! You belong to me now, Bella."" ""Yes! Yours!"" She yells as I start rubbing her clit needing her to fucking come before me. ""Damn, right! Mine. All fucking mine!"" I scream as I bend down and lift her entire body up slamming her against the headboard of the bed. The sounds of the headboard knocking against the wall fill the room as Bella claws at my back. ""So fucking good!"" She screams as I grind into her. Bella's pussy clenches around my cock like a vise grip as she comes. ""Come on my cock, Baby,"" I scream as I come inside of her. We hold onto each for what seems like forever, kissing and touching. Doing shit I've never dreamed of doing with any other woman. Just basking in her. I lay us down on the bed and dispose of the condom before taking her in my arms and kissing her. I laugh as I think about the first time we met. ""What's so funny?"" She looks at me as if I've lost my damn mind. ""I told you…"" I say to her pecking her lips gently. ""You told me what?"" She asks staring at me bewildered. ""That I would have you beneath me."" She smacks my shoulder hard as hell. ""Asshole."" ""Brat."" I kiss her hard on those pretty fucking lips, rolling her on top of me ready to go for round two. ~~TFYR~~ One-Year Later: Bella We stand barefoot on the hot sand. The setting sun glistens in the backdrop giving the entire wedding ceremony a beautiful glow. Edward is wearing a dark blue suit with a gray tie and matching vest. Family and friends smile happily at us, but not one smile is as big as the one I'm looking at right now. Sexy old dude. Edward. His smile is bright and radiant while Reverend Webber speaks about God's love. ""Edward and Bella have written their own vows to express their love."" He looks over at Edward, who is too busy staring at me to notice. I give him a pointed look and a giggle as our family and friends start chuckling at him. ""Edward…"" The priest says a little louder causing him to come out of his Bella induce haze. ""Oh! Sorry Rev."" Edward clears his throat a few times giving me a hard stare. It's not my fault, I'm a beautiful bride, if I do say so myself. ""Bella, from the moment I laid eyes on you, I knew I had to have you. I just had no idea I needed you for the rest of my life."" He pauses staring into my eyes. Tears pool in my eyes and I couldn't will them away if I wanted to. ""My days were empty and shallow until you sat next to me on the shuttle van. That day was the day my world was set straight. I love you Bella Marie Swan, and I will love you until the day I die, baby. You own me— mind, body, and soul."" One of his hands gently wipes the tears from my cheek. ""Bella."" Reverend Banner nods at me. I kiss Edward's hand softly lying on my cheek. ""We found each other when neither of us was looking, and although we fought it with everything we had, our love won the war. That love gives me strength, and courage, it fills me with so much joy that I'm afraid that I will burst. I love you Edward Cullen and I thank God every day for sitting me next to an arrogant, conceded hot old guy."" I pause allowing the crowd to laugh and Edward to smirk at me. ""You're my heart and soul. I would die every day waiting for you because you are the love of my life, forever."" Edward pulls me into him, capturing my lips with his own. My body melts into his and my arms wrap around him trying to pull him closer to me. ""Ummm, by the power invested in me I now pronounce you husband and wife. You may continue kissing your bride."" Reverend Webber says awkwardly. I'm too busy enjoying my husband to care about the crowd around us. Edwards's hands find their way to my ass and he takes a handful bunching up my silk gown. I can vaguely hear my father clear his throat over and over, but I can't find it in me to care. I am Mrs. Edward Cullen. Edward and I press our foreheads together catching our breaths. His green eyes meet mine, and he smiles. ""I love you, Brat."" ""I love you, too. Asshole."" ""Introducing Mr. and Mrs. Edward Cullen.""

In my hurry to touch him, I hadn't registered that he'd managed to unzip my skirt and unbutton my blouse. His lips skimmed down my neck and met his right hand at my right nipple. They worked in harmonious tandem as his left hand moved lower and he slipped a finger intomy wet channel. ""Oh, God!"" I gasped as he added a second finger. His mouth popped off my hard nipple. ""God isn't here,"" he breathed over my aching breast, ""it's just you and me."" To prove his point, he pumped the fingers in my core while flicking my clit with his thumb. ""Edward…"" ""That's better,"" he crooned before taking my lips in another crushing kiss. His ass flexed under my hands. I could feel my wetness leaking out of my pussy, through his fingers. I should be embarrassed at my lack of control. I wasn't. ""Bella, I need, I need more of you. Please."" My heart soared while my body clenched at the pleading in this beautiful man's voice. ""Bedroom,"" I panted. I groaned loudly when he pulled his beautiful fingers from my center. ""Don't worry I'll take care of you."" He promised with a quick kiss. I leaned heavily on the wall while Edward unceremoniously pulled my skirt and blouse off. He leaned down to finish removing his jeans and shoes. Unabashedly, I allowed my eyes to soak in the view. I knew he was beautiful, but an unclothed Edward took my breath away. ""I feel the same way."" His eyes found mine as he stood up. How did he know what I was thinking? I took his hand and walked us down the hallway to my bedroom. I couldn't explain where the strength came from but for the first time I acted like the strong, confident and passionate woman, Edward said he saw in me. ""On the bed. Now!"" I ordered. ""Yes ma'am."" Seeing his long, lean body laid out on my lavender, Calvin Klein comforter had every cell in my body screaming, ' mine! ' Remembering every porn movie I'd seen, I crawled up onto the bed on all fours and made my way up his body to straddle his waist. His hands encircled my waist as I leaned over him to turn on my bedside lamp. I'd never had a twenty-two-year-old man before. I wasn't going to pass up watching every toned muscle move as he took me. ""God, you're beautiful,"" he moaned as my weight settled on his hard cock. ""God isn't here,"" I smirked, throwing his words back at him while rubbing my pussy on his shaft. ""Oh, someone thinks she has the upper hand."" I squealed as Edward flipped us so that he was the one doing the rubbing. My legs clenched around his waist as my hands tightened on his shoulders. Edward's beautiful green eyes were darkened with lust. ""As you've probably guessed, I like strong women. And we'll explore that part of your character later. But first, there's a part of you I want to explore more."" The sound of my expensive panties being ripped from my body should have pissed me off. It didn't. ""Fuck! Look at you. You're dripping."" Edward held up two fingers. My arousal was evident on his long digits. In a flurry, my bra was removed, as were his briefs. ""I can't wait. I'm sorry, but I need you now."" I nodded and watched as he magically produced a condom. Sensing my confusion, Edward explained his trick. ""Um, I grabbed it out of my jeans. I figured you'd want me to wear one."" ""Thank you."" I was grateful that he'd remembered to act sensibly. After Jake, I'd decided to give my body a break from the hormones. I wasn't on birth control. I watched as he rolled the condom onto this considerable length and positioned himself at my waiting entrance. ""Look at me,"" he ordered. I tore my eyes from where we were almost connected to look into his eyes. ""I want you with everything I have, but I will walk away right now if you can't tell me you've put our age difference behind us. From now on, I want us to be just Bella and Edward. Two people exploring this world together in an equal partnership. Please tell me it's okay. Please."" Despite the intimate position our bodies were entangled in, I felt that his words had stripped him more naked than the loss of his clothes had. ""Edward,"" I cupped his jaw in my hands, drawing him in for a long kiss. His cock pushed at my swollen labia as his tongue pushed into my mouth. He drew back from the kiss, his eyes searching mine, ""you're the smartest, funniest, sexiest and most capable man I've ever met. You constantly amaze me with the kindness you show everyone around you. For the last year, I'd denied myself the chance to be with the most amazing man I've ever met. I'm not going to let a paltry ten years get in the way of our chance at finding something real. If you want me, I'm yours."" I was amazed at how easily the truth fell from my lips. Edward smiled sweetly for a moment and then his eyes darkened with lust. I barely had a moment to hold onto his broad shoulders before he filled me completely. He caught my gasps with his mouth before pulling away and setting a delicious rhythm inside me. ""Then I hope you can keep up because I plan to keep you for a very long time."" ""Oh, I think I can keep up just fine."" Hosts' Reminder: Remember to leave the entry some love by hitting the review button.

His eyes darted from my hard nipple to my face. ""Do you understand now, Bella? Do you think I'm a gentleman now that you know I've been jerking off to fantasies of you exposed to me like this?"" ""I think so,"" I stuttered. Edward smirked and brought his head down to my breast, sucking gently on my nipple. ""God, yes,"" I moaned, my head falling backward as the coil inside me started to build. ""That's not my name, baby girl,"" Edward admonished, pinching my nipple between his thumb and forefinger. ""Tell me who you've been thinking of in your lonely bed,"" he urged. ""Have you been aching for my, Bella?"" ""Yes, Edward, yes."" ""Do you ever touch yourself, love?"" he asked, still holding me against the wall of the empty room. My breaths were beginning to echo into the empty space. I nodded. ""Mmmmm…"" Edward hummed as if considering the molding, while his hand moved from my breast to slide under my skirt, gently tickling my inner thighs as they moved higher. ""I've imagined that, but no matter how tempting the thought of you touching yourself may be, I bet it's nothing compared to how wet you are for me right now."" As his fingers reached my quivering pussy, I knew he found proof of his words. My panties were soaked, and I could feel my walls flutter as he cupped my sex. I expected another smirk, but his jaw clenched tight, as he growled. ""So wet…"" He pushed the fabric of my panties aside and pressed his thumb against my clit. I reached out to grab his shoulders, unable to stand without his support any longer. ""Hold on tight, Baby Girl,"" he said pulling his head back to take in my face. I could only imagine what I looked like, my mouth hanging open and my eyes glazed as he masterfully worked my body with his magic fingers. ""So good,"" was the best I could manage. Perhaps dirty talk was a skill one earned through experience. ""Mine,"" he called as I clung to him. ""Yes,"" I whimpered. ""I'm yours, Edward."" ""That's it Baby Girl, say my name,"" he encouraged while he moved his hands over my body in ways I could no longer understand or describe. It felt like his touch was everywhere, and I could feel the tingles building in my stomach. ""Oh Edward,"" I called, ""I've wanted you so much."" With that admission, the last strings holding me to the earth snapped. I could feel my body arch off the wall, spurned on by his hardness against mine rubbing into me in all the right places as his long fingers circled my hardened nipples. Even as the sensation was no longer trapped within my body, I still saw spots of light as Edward bent down to take my breast in his mouthas his own release came. His bronze head moved slowly up my body, kissing me lightly as he made his way from my breast up my chest. With a groan, he continued kissing up my throat and neck as he smoothed out my skirt. I was still a quivering mess, but dressed again when his lips met my ear. ""That's one way a man can show a woman how much he desires her, Bella. However, there are many others. And I intend to show you all of them."" ""I think you'll find me eager to learn,"" I whispered in his ear in return. ""But just because I'm younger, I hope you don't think I have nothing to show you."" Edward pulled back and gave me his best smirk. He took both my hands in his and guided me out of the room. ""I'm counting on it,"" Edward said smiling. When Phil walked me down the aisle toward his handsome son, I couldn't help but remember the day we had both met him. All three of us – my stepfather, my husband-to-be, and me – had been lost in our own grief and doubts. They say you can never truly love someone without opening yourself to the risk of pain. As I kissed Phil's cheek, both of us with tears streaming down our faces, I knew I could still only imagine the pain he had experienced from my mother's death. But, I also knew in the core of my very being, that truly loving someone was worth the risk, even the inevitability, of that hurt. Phil's hand trembled slightly as he took mine and placed it over Edward's, which made me glance anxiously into my stepfather – soon to be father-in-law's face. The green eyes I met had deeper lines around them, but they were no longer dull and full of pain. The grief was still there, of course, but it was mixed with strength. Phil glanced from me to Edward and his mouth pulled up into a crooked smile so similar to the man I was about to marry that it made laugh. My mother and Phil's love story would be remembered, not just by us, but also by the world. So many had read about it the papers and responded to our personal tragedy with generosity that made her memorial foundation a leader in breast cancer research. But, I knew it was more than the charity that brought on Phil's change. Though it would never be the same without my mother, we were a family once again. The three of us, as well as Gran and Carlisle and Esme, who were all looking on with tears of their own. It didn't matter who was related by blood – We were all bound together by love.

58,4,15,4-MaytoDecemberRomanceContest-15.txt,twilight,MaytoDecemberRomanceContest,"across the back seat and I'd never been happier in my life. Early morning sunlight woke us and my heart soared as I stared into fathomless, seaweed green. The lines around his eyes made them beautiful to me and I wanted him again, even though I knew I had to get home. I stroked his hair with shaking fingers as we communicated without words, our eyes saying it all. There was no regret in us and yet I suspected that Edward would try and avoid a repeat performance due to his sense of morality. His hands raked through my hair, combing the tangles out with sensuous fingers. I pulled his face to mine and I kissed him with very ounce of the love I had thundering through my heart and entire being. He returned the kiss, it was bittersweet and so filled with despair I felt my heart ache and tears prick my eyelids. Edward drove me home slowly, our fingers intertwined on his thigh. When we got there, I said goodbye with one last kiss and a brief hug before sneaking into the house via a side door. I reached my room safely, my heart still sore and achy. My body was filled with elation as much as my heart was filled with dread. However, deep down inside my heart I can't shake the feeling that some things are simply meant to be. E~D~W~A~R~D I had done it. I'd taken Bella's innocence and betrayed my best friend and yet I couldn't find the necessary guilt or shame. Some part of me refused to believe that she wasn't already mine to begin with. After leaving Bella at home, I'd gone to my house showered, dressed and left for the office; my mind focused on Bella when it should have been on work. Every sigh and moan she'd uttered were branded on my mind in crystal clear, high definition, surround sound. The way her rich, buttercream chocolate eyes looked just before she came or how she said my name, throaty and filled with suppressed emotion. She consumed me. She was nearly twenty-one now, I kept telling myself. Perfectly legal. All I'd done wrong, was take the daughter of a very good friend. I had not intended to let it get that far last night, but the thought of her with anyone else had driven me to claim her and brand her with every inch of myself. I chastised myself for being so rough with my angel … But all control had been gone once I began. I braced myself to face Charlie this morning. He seemed a bit off, but I was so focused on my own worries I chose to ignore it and concentrate on work instead. But every goddamn time I looked at something, it held a memory of Bella. I shook my head in frustration and slammed my laptop shut after an hour of staring at the screen and accomplishing nothing, massaging the bridge between my eyes roughly. ""Hard night?"" Charlie inquired from the doorway, where he leaned, super casual and wonderfully familiar. I jumped visibly and eyed him with a fair amount of irritation. ""Yes, I had a late night last night. My mind just isn't in the game this morning."" I confessed. Charlie chuckled as he entered and went to stand by the wide windows which overlooked the coastline. ""Funny, Bella went out last night too, and she was also out of it this morning. You two are so much alike even after five years apart."" He eyed me with humor. ""Have you gone to see her yet?"" I watched him warily searching for some clue as to whether he knew something or not. ""Actually, I saw her briefly yesterday at your house. Paris did her good, it's seems."" ""Yes it did. However, I think she missed home. She is so much happier since she got back. Dreamy even. I haven't seen her like this before."" I cleared my throat and turned back to my laptop, opening it once again. Agitated. ""I'm glad she is so happy. She deserves nothing but the best."" Charlie went to leave but stopped at the door, his face a curious mixture of harshness and contentment. ""Edward?"" ""Yes, Charlie?"" ""Be good to her."" His words floored me. ""I always knew it would be you. Just don't hide things from me; you know how that fucks me off. I'll tell Bella to invite you over to dinner tonight, first time in your new capacity and all. I'm sure it will thrill her."" I stared at him. Frozen. Shocked. Fucking perplexed. ""You knew?"" Charlie gave me a condescending look as he opened the door and prepared to leave. ""Edward, for Bella there has only ever been you. I knew it from the time she was twelve years old. You're the best man for her, I won't object – now that she's grown up. In life, some things are meant to be, and you two are one of them."" I was fucking speechless, which was a first. All this time and all that worrying had been pointless. He'd known all along. ""Charlie ... I'm sorry. I didn't plan it. You have to know that."" ""Oh, I know that, Edward. You're my best friend and I know that you're a good man - the best. I told you before - I trust you with my shit and - apparently - my daughter."" He laughed. ""Just don't break her heart."" ""I never could. She means everything to me."" I told him. And I meant it. Charlie nodded at me as he left. ""See you tonight."" A genuine smile spread across my face. No shadows or closed doors for us; this love we shared was meant to be.

59,4,11,4-MaytoDecemberRomanceContest-11.txt,twilight,MaytoDecemberRomanceContest,"what the look on my face is like, but he must see something that makes him change the subject, while I'm left trying to picture how that would go. What would it be like for Seth to meet Edward? Would they get along? I shake my head, clearing those thoughts. I can't let myself go there. After Edward pays the bill, ""because it's a date, and I insist"", we venture back out into the night. The faint melody of brass instruments fills the air, and Edward pulls me by my hand down the street until it's closer and louder. When we reach the next intersection, I can see three older gentlemen sitting on the opposite corner, blowing into their trumpets and saxophones. The melody is familiar, and Edward begins to hum along, taking me by the hand and pulling me into his chest. ""Dance with me."" ""Here?"" I ask, looking around at the mostly deserted street. ""Yes."" He holds me close, and we begin moving to the music—my cheek on his chest and one of his hands splayed across the bare skin on my back, the other hand holding mine and tucked under my chin. He rests his head on top of mine, and we sway. ""You're ruining me."" The words leave my lips just as a tear slips out of the corner of my eye. ""How?"" ""No other man will ever live up to this."" I'm only telling the truth, what I'm feeling in my heart. ""That's what I'm hoping for."" Suddenly, the world feels cruel and the what-ifs take over my mind. What if he were older. What if I were younger. What if we lived closer. What if, what if, what if… I take a deep breath, immersing myself in Edward, and push all of that away, if only for a night. Carpe diem and all that jazz. ***H*** The ride to the airport feels entirely too short. I've been near tears since last night. Edward and I haven't discussed my departure outside of the facts—when and where. Even last night, as we lay there in the dark, neither of us said a word. As the taxi pulls up in front of the departures gate, Edward hops out and waits for the driver to get my bags. ""We can say goodbye here if you want."" ""No. You still have three hours before your flight leaves. I'll stay until you have to go through security."" ""OK."" I know the longer we prolong the inevitable, the harder it's going to be. I don't want to say goodbye. I can't. I don't really know what I want, but I do know I want to see Edward again. As many conversations as we've had, we've never talked about what happens when we leave London. Sure, we've talked about what we're doing when we get back, but not what we are doing. I walk up to the ticket counter and wait in line to check my luggage and get my boarding pass. Every minute or so, I look over my shoulder to make sure Edward is still there. Just this little bit of distance has me on edge, and I kick myself for allowing these feelings to creep up on me like this. I knew I'd be going home. I knew this was just a holiday. I knew we would say goodbye and that this would always just be a fond memory. ""How many bags, miss?"" The attendant checks over my passport and begins printing out my documents. ""Just two."" ""Did you have a nice holiday?"" ""The best."" ""We hope you'll be back to see us again soon."" She smiles and slides my tickets over to me, taking my bags and placing them on the belt. This is it. I'm going home. Leaving London and Edward. I force back the tears that are threatening to fall and hurry back to where he's standing. We walk to the security line, and it's long. I know I need to go. The last thing I need is to miss my flight. Actually, that doesn't sound like a bad idea. ""Hey."" His finger tips my chin up. ""What are you thinking about?"" ""I probably should go. This line is really long. It'll probably take me an hour to get through it."" ""Yeah."" ""I guess this is goodbye."" I barely make it into his arms before my face breaks. I don't want him to see me cry. I feel weak and vulnerable. Edward's arms encase me, and he holds me so tight I feel like I can't breathe. ""Don't hold me like you're never going to see me again,"" I tell him, pressed against his chest and wishing he'd never have to let go. ""Then don't talk like this is goodbye,"" he counters. ""This isn't goodbye,"" I retract, taking back what I said. I don't know how I know, but I do. In this moment, staring up into his beautiful green eyes, I know that what we have isn't just a holiday romance. It's real, and there's a chance we can make this work outside of London. It might not be easy or conventional, but nothing worth having is ever easy. And who needs convention? ""Until I see you again,"" he says, smiling down at me, his arms still holding me tightly. ""Until I see you again,"" I agree. He nods, twisting his lips into a smirk. ""It's not going to be the same without you. These next few days are going to be hell, but just know that this has been the best holiday ever."" ""I couldn't have dreamed of a better one."" I smile up at him, trying to memorize everything about him. ""I wish every holiday could be with you."" ""That's what I'm hoping for.""

60,4,13,4-MeetTheMateContest-13.txt,twilight,MeetTheMateContest,"and the tenth one is a liar?"" I smiled, smug. He shrugged again, still smirking. ""I seem to be an exception, then. It's better to be different from the rest of the crowd, don't you think?"" His green eyes smoldered and I struggled to maintain my train of thought. ""You know what, I'll take on the challenge of converting you into a chocolate fan,"" I said decidedly. ""You, mister, are going to be turned into such a fan that you're going to wish that there was a Chocoholics Anonymous."" He laughed and I joined in until our desserts arrived and my mind focused solely on the delicacy in front of me. As I took a bite and the delicious, rich gooey taste exploded in my mouth, I moaned, this time, very softly, and licked my lips. I looked up to see Edward, his hand with the spoon, raised mid-air while his gaze was fixed on my lips, his dessert long forgotten. I cleared my throat, smirking when he looked away quickly and continued with my precious, precious treat. We sat there and chatted for over three hours and it was as if we'd created a little bubble of our own, unaware of the surroundings. It was only when the waitress approached to let us know that it was closing time that we broke apart, shaking our heads and smiling sheepishly. Edward insisted on paying the bill and with one of the other guys I'd dated in the past, the feminist in me would probably have been incensed and would not have rested until I'd paid half. But one look at Edward's earnest face and the protest flew from my mind. I'd insist on paying next time. Next time? Presumptuous much? Hell yeah! I want a next time with Edward Cullen. As we walked out to the elevator, I felt a delightful prickle on my skin and looked down to see Edward's hand brush lightly against mine. Bolstering my confidence, I reached out and took his hand in mine, reveling when he smiled and entwined our fingers together. As we rode down the elevator, the air around us seemed charged with the same sparks that I felt flowing between us where our hands were connected. I gulped and breathed heavily, all the while wondering if he felt the same desire I did. To press my mouth against his and test if those lips of his were as soft as they looked. Neither of us said anything, until Edward offered to walk me to my car once I told him that I'd parked a little further down the road in an alley. By the time we reached there, still in silence, I was nervous. Didn't he have a good time? Didn't he want to see me again? All the breath left my lungs in a whoosh when I suddenly felt myself pinned against the wall, right next to my car. Edward's arms formed an inescapable cage around me and his warm breath washed over me as he leaned in to whisper in my ear. ""I had a great time, Bella. Thank you for spending the evening with me. And for teaching me about the right way to drink Coke."" He chuckled, the rich, deep sound sending shivers down my spine and my heart sped as I raised my arms slowly, wrapping them around his neck. ""You're most welcome. And I had a wonderful time with you, too,"" I replied honestly. ""May I kiss you, Miss Swan?"" It was a hypnotizing, seductive whisper and I couldn't have refused even if I'd wanted to. And of course I didn't want to! ""Yes."" My voice cracked in anticipation. He pulled back to look at me for a second and leaned in quickly. Before I knew it, his warm, soft lips were on mine, his fingers entangling in my hair and pulling me closer, pressing me against his hard, muscular form. As if I was going anywhere. All thoughts left my brain when he tilted his head slightly, opening his mouth and stroking my bottom lip with his sinful tongue. I gasped at the sensations he evoked in me, my lips parting and he took the opportunity to explore my mouth. I moaned when I met my tongue with his, stroking it languidly while his hands roamed over my back. He tasted like the sugary goodness we'd feasted on and I couldn't get enough of him. We broke apart only when breathing became absolutely necessary, gasping and panting as he pressed his forehead to mine. I opened my eyes to find his closed. I watched as his eyes squeezed shut for a few seconds, opened suddenly and gazed deeply into mine until I was lost in their emerald depths. A strange expression overtook his face and he mouthed something to me. I couldn't understand what he'd said or why his demeanor had changed so suddenly. I was about to verbalize my confusion when I felt a sharp sting at the side of my neck. My hand flew up instinctively and I caught his hand there. It held an object. A syringe. My eyes widened in abject terror as I looked up at his face. As a dull, sleepy wave slowly overtook my senses, I couldn't comprehend the emotion that his features held. My head swam as I fought desperately to keep awake, but I knew in my heart that it was a futile effort and seconds later, I felt his arms around me again. This time, though, they were trying to hold me steady as my body swayed, totally out of my control. That same undecipherable expression in his eyes was the last thing I saw before my world dissolved into darkness. What the hell had Emmett gotten me into?

61,4,14,4-MeetTheMateContest-14.txt,twilight,MeetTheMateContest,"if I was just reading a story to a deaf baby so I ask Maggie if the baby is deaf. Maggie just kind of glares at me but doesn't answer and since my mom hasn't arrived, I pick up the baby and ask Maggie to show me her room so we can get this over with. The baby's room is also the mom's room. There is a double mattress on the floor in the corner of the room and a crib in another corner. Maggie gets out the diapers and a blanket and lays the blanket on the bed. ""We change her on the bed,"" she says and then she starts singing a song about the moon to Luna. Changing a poopy diaper is even worse then wiping Red's bum, but I keep telling myself that at least I'm not in the hospital right now, unconscious and bleeding from the head. As I'm walking back to the living room with Luna in my arms and Maggie close beside me, my Mom shows up. ""Oh Edward!"" She says bringing me in for a half hug since I've got a baby in my arms. Mom has this look on her face when she sees me holding the baby and I know exactly what she is thinking, but I ignore it. Right now is not the time to discuss how much she wants grandkids. She sees Maggie beside me and crouches down so they are on the same level. I notice she has a giant bag filled with toys and snacks with her. How the hell she had time to do all that I have no idea. She's probably been stock-piling things in the hopes of being a grandmother some day. ""Hi, I'm Edward's mom. You can call me Esme. What's your name?"" And with that, my Mom has officially taken over. XXXXXXX A little while later I'm sitting in the hospital room and double stroller mom is still unconscious. My Mom went through her things and packed a bag for her (I never would have thought to do that) and even found her wallet. I lied to the nurses and told them I was family, that we were cousins. I almost told them that I was her husband but then I told myself to shut the hell up. Bella (I need to start calling her that, it's much easier to say) lays there pale and still. She's breathing but that's the only movement and it's kind of creepy. In her hospital gown, under the white, flannel sheet I can see just how thin she is and I can't help but wonder what her life is like. She lives in a tiny house with three young daughters, and according to Maggie, no help. According to Red, she asked their Dad to leave after an unwarranted spanking, but who knows what the hell that really means when it isn't filtered through the mind of a three-year old. The nurse told me to talk to her and even though it feels kind of foolish, I do it because I want her to know her kids are okay in case is freaking out inside. ""Hey, double stroller mom."" Ugh. This is hard. ""So, you don't really know me, but I'm one of the guys who works on the construction crew building the new sidewalks on your street."" For something to do, I take her hand. ""I guess you had an accident this morning and now you are in the hospital and my mom is looking after your girls. Don't worry. My mom is pretty much the best mom ever, so your girls will be safe although they would really like you to wake up. Your little mini-me, Maggie, is quite the amazing kid. I think she put me in my place about five times this morning. I can tell you're also one of the best moms ever."" I don't really know what else to say but I like holding her hand. It's tiny and cold and so I feel like I'm doing something productive by holding it and warming it up. ""Emmett, that's my cousin, the one Franny calls Giant Man, is still talking about your cinnamon buns. His wife isn't the best cook, and now he whines like a dog every time he sees you and your girls walking by. He's always hoping you're going to bring him more food. Of course, he's always hoping anyone will bring him food. I bet he would sit on the floor by your table and beg for scraps if given the chance."" ""My name is Edward. I was working in front of your house this morning, which is where your daughter found me. I'm so glad she did."" I feel like I should talk more, but I don't really know what to say. There are things I want to say, like how I watch her every time she walks by pushing that double stroller. How I am in awe of her strength to raise three little girls on her own, and ask their dad to leave even though I don't know the whole story. I can tell she is strong even if she looks like a frail bird lying under the hospital sheet. I want to tell her that sometimes I've dreamed about being invited to the playground with her and her girls or taking her out on a date. I don't want to tell her about another dream I had about her because I already feel like a creepy-stalker-dude and I'm sure she is going to be freaked out enough when she wakes up. Instead of talking, I watch her and hold her hand and hope, and maybe even pray a little, that she will wake up soon and be okay. Please remember to leave the author some love.

""Consider this my two weeks notice."" I ignore his disapproving plea and press on, disappearing into the crowd. For all I know, he doesn't follow, which is for the best. At least for him, anyway. I just recently purchased a new pepper spray. ... It's weird not seeing Sue in her office or Seth at the other end of the counter. They say they'll still stay in touch, but it won't be the same. The Upper East side might as well be a million miles away. ""Tell me you're not still angry with me."" Chin in my hand, I refuse to look up. ""Who said I was angry?"" ""Nobody had to say it, Isabella."" ""I'm not angry."" ""Then why not allow me to drive you home?"" He's been asking me that every day for the past two weeks, and every day I give him a different answer. I'm not going home. I have a ride. I don't want you to know where I live, stalker. You name it, I've used it as an excuse. ""I don't like that suit."" ""This suit?"" he asks, and I look up high enough to see him pat the front of his jacket. ""Yeah. It's too business. And I'm more of a casual kind of girl."" Obviously. Just look at my shirt. I'm surprised when he walks away without another word. It's the easiest I've gotten rid of him the past two weeks. The rest of my night goes a little too fast for my liking since I've stuck to my guns and start the new job on Monday at the bakery across the street from me. It has insurance, great hours and, best of all, no more five-day-a-week subway rides. Who knows, maybe I'll be able to start making my rent on time. Wiping off the last table, I look over my shoulder when the doorbell jingles. ""We're closed, ya know?"" I say, pointing to the CLOSED sign. ""I know the owner."" I huff a laugh. ""Yeah, me too. Real douchenozzle, isn't he?"" ""The worst."" Straightening, I turn over a chair then stare at him for a moment before crossing the room. I start at the Converse on his feet, working my way up the pair of dark jeans to settle on his shirt. ""Is that …?"" Grabbing the flaps of his blazer, I rip them open to reveal a corporate dick. ""Is this penis wearing a tie? And lookit, he's even got a cell phone stuck to the side of his head. Aww ..."" Admiring the busy phallus, I don't realize I've taken a step closer to him until I smell his cologne. ""So, is this casual enough for you?"" he asks in that accent of his. Internally sighing, I pat down the flaps of his blazer, flattered by how hard he's trying. ""It's a start. But we've still got a long way to go."" ""Does that mean you're finally going to let me drive you home?"" he asks, and I look up at him for the first time in two weeks. It's hard not to feel responsible for the dark circles under his eyes. ""Only if you feed me first."" Flipping the lights off, I interlock our arms to lead him out the doors. ""You know, I just realized I never told you my name,"" he says as we walk in synchronized steps down West Broadway. ""Oh, no. I know your name. Called it from the very first moment we met, Douchenozzle. Don't you remember?"" ""Ah, how could I forget?"" His smile warms me quicker than the breeze blowing against our backs.

63,4,3,4-MeetTheMateContest-3.txt,twilight,MeetTheMateContest,"this lifestyle will be a better choice?"" He took a sip from the gold-rimmed white cup in his hand and seemed to deliberate over his reply. ""Miss Swan, as your aunt has probably informed you, I am a man of simple tastes. I want a wife who would be content with the kind of life I prefer. A few friends to converse with, my basic needs met with, and working for the welfare of my people—these things are enough to make me happy. Now, such girls may exist in titled families too, but I have not met one yet. Most of them are raised to be social butterflies, interested only in new gowns, new jewels and more balls than I care for. That is not to say,"" he added hurriedly, misinterpreting my look of incredulity, ""that we will not have any social life. Of course there will be visiting and dancing and such—just not all the time. Is that all right with you?"" I relaxed at his words. Of course it was fine by me. Even though I liked spending time with friends and dancing, I liked my books and gardening more. I assured him with utmost sincerity that I had always dreamt of such a life—quiet, useful, and with my loved ones around me. That made him relax visibly, his shoulders losing the tension they had held until then. We drank our tea and exchanged more information about our interests and our families. He was an only child, but had a cousin he was close to. His father, Lord James Masen, lived a fair distance away. His mother had passed away when he was only three, and his father had never remarried. The fact seemed to make him sad. I changed the topic, hating the pain in his eyes. He loved horses and had many of them in his stable. When I stammered that I had never learnt riding, he promised he would teach me. Too soon Esme was knocking at the door, and Anthony seemed to think it would be awkward to meet her right then. He requested me to convey his regards to her and left quickly through the same glass door that he had entered from, after bestowing a brief kiss on the back of my hand. It made me smile like a lovesick fool. I happily gave my consent to my aunt, who in turn conveyed it to my parents. The wedding was fixed to take place just after a month, which seemed to my mother too short a time to make all the proper arrangements. But a message from Anthony stated that they were not to worry and everything would be organised at the estate. Esme—and Elizabeth Masen, his aunt—would be involved, and they would also consult my mother wherever required. Mamma was a little disappointed I think, but my father asked her to be more practical. There was no way we could have arranged a wedding fit enough for a lord, not to mention his extended family, friends and acquaintances. He might have simple tastes, but they would expect something grand. Still, there were numerous things to be done, and time passed in a flurry of dress fittings and choosing wedding favours for our guests, among other things. Esme kept us informed on the preparations going on at the estate, ""ooh""-ing and ""aah""-ing over the decorations for the reception and the menu for the wedding dinner. It all sounded very impressive and rather overwhelming. Soon my wedding day was upon us, and we were gathered in the little church where every wedding in the town took place. It was dimly lit by the light filtering in through the small, stained-glass windows, but I knew Anthony was waiting for me at the end of the aisle. I focussed on my shoes while walking towards him so as to not stumble, though my father had assured me that he wouldn't let me fall. Once he placed my hand in Anthony's, I relaxed and glanced at him through my veil, but his face was turned to the minister. Well, that was the right thing to do, wasn't it? I too turned to face the minister and waited for him to say the words I had been dreaming of since I had met Anthony. ""Dearly beloved, we are gathered here to celebrate the union of…"" ""Please repeat after me…"" As Anthony and I said our vows, I felt as if my heart would burst with happiness. ""I do."" ""I do."" ""You may now kiss the bride."" Finally the moment had come. Since the day he had kissed my hand, I had been thinking about his full lips on my own. But right then I had a fit of shyness and closed my eyes. Anthony lifted my veil and kissed my…cheek. I opened my eyes, confused, and looked into his—and my confusion turned to shock. These were not the jade-green eyes I remembered from that day, a month ago. These were grey-blue, and although the face they were set in had some resemblance to the other, it was not the same face. Had it been a practical joke—sending someone else to meet me? But why would he do that? I felt dizzy as we turned towards the guests and were introduced as Lord Anthony Masen and Lady Isabella Masen. After having accepted the congratulations from our families, I was suddenly roused by my husband's voice. ""Isabella, I would like you meet my best man—also my cousin—Edward Masen. Edward, this is my wife—Lady Isabella Masen."" Long lashes swept his cheeks as his lips burnt the skin of my hand. He lifted his head to reveal familiar green eyes, and they were full of pain. ""Lady Isabella, it is an honour to meet you."" Please remember to leave the author some love.

'With God all things are possible.'"" She laughed softly. ""This is fun, but I'm not fool enough to get into a scripture quoting contest with someone whose job it is to pull the perfect reference out of his hat at any moment."" ""Hmm, I don't know. I'm guessing that even as a child you knew the answer to any question ever asked during the children's sermon,"" he challenged. ""Well, that's easy,"" she replied. ""Usually the answer was Jesus, forgiveness, or 'because God loves you', you just have to pick best one."" ""See, I knew you had all the answers!"" he laughed. ""Yes, you're right, I'm clearly a scriptural savant,"" she joked. ""Since we've covered religion, should we move on politics?"" ""Oh yes, let's get those two conversational pariahs out of the way so we can move on to more substantial topics!"" Throughout dinner, Edward and Bella learned more about one another. Bella shared her frustration with dating in the past year and her resulting self-reflection. She told how she had gone back to her roots, including re-connecting with her church. Edward seemed intrigued by her journey of self-discovery, asking insightful questions and giving suggestions for how to strengthen her faith. As they enjoyed a cup of coffee sitting alone on the sofa after dinner, Bella admitted to herself the incredibly strong attraction she felt for Edward. She didn't think she had ever felt anything quite like it. Beyond his good looks and easy manner, she found him smart and engaging. He laughed often but then could challenge her opinions without making her feel inferior. There was something between them and she was confident that he felt it too. She was just about to ask him another question when his cell phone buzzed in his pocket. ""I'm sorry about this Bella,"" he said as he pulled it out and glanced at the display. ""I have to take this, please excuse me."" He stood and went into the kitchen for some privacy, only to return a few moments later. ""Bella, one of my parishioners has had a heart attack. He's going in for surgery tonight and the family has asked me to come to the hospital. I'm sorry, but I have to go."" ""Of course you do!"" she said, standing to join him. ""Listen, before I head out, I'd like to ask you something. Would you like to have coffee with me sometime soon? Maybe this weekend? We could continue to get to know one another."" ""I'd really like that."" He smiled brightly at her. ""Wonderful. If you give me your number I'll call you tomorrow to make plans."" She smiled back and reached out her hand. ""Give me your phone and I'll program my number for you."" He passed her his phone and she quickly entered her contact information before handing it back. ""I'm really glad we met tonight,"" he said. ""So am I, Edward,"" she said with a smile. ""Talk to you tomorrow."" Edward quickly said his goodbyes to the others and left for the hospital. As promised, Edward called the next day and that Saturday night Bella was in a local coffee shop waiting to meet him. She'd arrived early and found a table by the window where she was watching the rain. After 10 minutes, she went to the counter and ordered a coffee to sip while she waited. Five minutes later she called his cell phone but it went right to voice mail. She left him a message saying she was at the coffee shop and that she hoped everything was okay. Then she waited some more. She knew he was chronically late…his family took bets on it! She assured herself that he was probably just running late as usual. Another five minutes passed and she was chewing her thumbnail, beginning to wonder if she had imagined the connection she felt toward Edward at Alice's house. Edward is really nice but he should know to at least call when he's this late. Maybe I mis-read him. I thought this had potential, but maybe I'm wrong. A few more minutes passed and Bella's self-doubt grew. He was probably just being nice to me so he wouldn't hurt Alice's feelings. That didn't mean he had to ask me out though. We could have gone our separate ways after dinner. That would have been perfectly fine! Hmph. How long does etiquette demand that I wait for a date to show? If he's just five or ten minutes late and I leave, that makes me a jerk because anything could delay him that long. If I wait too long, that makes me desperate with nothing better to do than wait for some guy to show. What's the magic number between jerk and desperate? If Alice and Jasper weren't at a movie I'd call her right now. Okay, I decree that 20 minutes should be the normal limit, but Edward is time-challenged…. Damn, it's pouring out now. I'll get another coffee and give him 10 more minutes, then I'm out of here, rain or not. After getting a refill, Bella sat back in her seat and stared at her watch. Nine minutes to go. Damn this coffee is hot. Seven minutes. Cool enough to sip without scalding my tongue. Four minutes. I probably should use the restroom before I leave. The ten minutes were up just as Bella exited the restroom and swept her gaze around the coffee shop a final time. Well, over half an hour is more than enough - even for prodigal pastors. After putting on her coat, Bella pushed opened the door of the coffee shop and walked out into the rain. Please remember to leave the author some love.

I don't think he had any intention of telling me your address. However, when I kept saying that I wanted to return it, he made a sarcastic comment about that being unlikely, unless I was planning to be in Chicago."" At this, Bella's grin stretched from one delicate ear to another. I smirked, imagining the scene Bella was describing. Despite her obvious shyness, she clearly had no trouble standing up for herself. ""You should have seen the look on his face when I told him I did plan on being in Chicago,"" she gleefully continued. ""I said I'd let Mr. and Mrs. Cullen know how helpful he had been in making sure their ring was returned. I swear I knew by the look on his face I made the right choice in not turning it over. And, it wasn't that hard to find an Edward Cullen in Chicago. You were the only one listed, and even if there had been a dozen of you, I would have tried every address."" ""Thank you, Bella,"" I said, fervently. ""That's truly an incredible story, and you are obviously a rare soul to have gone through all that just to perform a good deed."" ""You make it sound like I was turning in a briefcase full of cash or something,"" Bella replied, shaking her head. ""You don't have to be any special type of person to know that a wedding ring means a lot more to its proper owner than any amount of money."" My chest tightened at her words. She didn't think she was special. She thought anyone would see the value in this tiny band beyond what an insurance company might pay to have it replaced. Bella was incredibly kind, and perhaps a bit naïve. I hoped she would be able to handle herself in Chicago. But, then I remembered the pepper spray and her distrust of the Waldorf's concierge. Neither of us said anything for several minutes. I couldn't stop staring into Bella's eyes, and she held my gaze. Slowly, her expression transformed from sympathy and indignation to surprise at what she saw in my eyes as I drank her in. The air around us crackled with an energy I had never experienced before. ""Do you think Tanya will be home soon?"" Bella's voice trembled and cracked at the question. I shook my head and looked up at the clock. My heart began hammering as I saw the time. Bella and I had been talking for hours. Out of the corner of my eye, I could see her stifle a small yawn. ""Actually, I'm surprised she's not here, yet,"" I said, grabbing my phone to send her a text. Tanya's reply came back quickly, telling me to not wait up for her. ""Umm…"" I looked up at Bella, trying to come up with an appropriate thing to say. She was yawning more widely now. ""Bella,"" I started, ""I'm sorry, but I don't think Tanya will be home soon, and you're obviously exhausted. Why don't I show you the guest room, and we can all have breakfast in the morning. That way you can have a break before having to tell the story again."" I tried to form half a smile at this small joke. ""Are you sure?""she started, but I held up a hand, cutting her off. ""Not another word,"" I said. ""I promised an officer of the law that you'll be safe and sound in our home and Tanya will be here in the morning to thank you."" It was evident just how worn out the sweet girl was because she didn't put up too much more of a fight. After retrieving her small overnight bag from the metal monster, I carried it up to the guest room. I promised that the three of us – myself, Tanya, and Bella would have a good talk in the morning before we helped her move into the dorms. ""It's the least we could do,"" I insisted for the tenth time before wishing her a good night and returning downstairs to wait for the woman I was planning to marry. I sat in the living room, turning the ring over in my fingers as the minutes, then hours ticked by. ~One year later~ The house is full of friends, as well as friends of other friends, and I can hear my wife's laughter drifting from the patio over the music of steel drums. I smirked at the irony of a beach party in a Chicago suburb, but everyone seemed to be having a wonderful time. ""Edward,"" my friend Emmett called from the front door. He made his way to me, followed by a statuesque blond and the gaze of nearly every male in the room. As they made their way over, his arm slinked around her slender waist. ""You must be Rosalie,"" I said, holding out my hand. She smiled quickly at me before looking adoringly at my best friend. ""It's nice to finally meet you, Edward,"" she said. ""Emmett's been teasing me about this great story of how you met your wife, but he said I'd have to hear it from you."" Though we may not be honeymooners anymore, I still get a thrill from hearing the words 'your wife.' I also never got tired of telling our story – I imagined I'd end up repeating it every day to the staff at our nursing home when we were old and senile. But, I gave Rosalie an off-handed shrug. ""It's not that much of a story,"" I said. ""She just showed up on my doorstep with an engagement ring one evening."" Please remember to leave the author some love.

He nodded, trying to rearrange his legs to hide the effect she was having on him. Was it the fresh country air? The craziness with the goats? The roundness of this woman, from her apple cheeks, strawberry lip and the ripe melons hidden in her shirt. Everything about her was lush and made him hungry for more than food. Stop it , he chastised himself. You're here temporarily, and getting into it with your boss's cousin was a bad idea. He needed to stick to the facts. ""So my boss is your cousin?"" ""He's my cousin, but not Rose's. We have the same father but different mothers."" He chewed on his toast, eyebrows raised, not sure if he wanted to step into that cow pie. She twirled a piece of her long, brown hair. ""Aren't you going to ask? Most people want to know how that worked out."" He cleared his throat, trying not to appear too anxious. ""I do, but I don't…want to ask if it bothers you."" ""Doesn't bother me."" She sat back, her tea to her lips. ""Our fertile father managed to impregnate the stripper at his bachelor party and his new bride on the same weekend."" Edward swallowed his tea. ""So who's who?"" ""I'd like to tease you some more, but it's only a matter of time before you find out. I was three when the cops showed up with Rose. Her momma was killed in a car crash. My momma was pregnant with Alice, but she couldn't turn Rose away. From what I'm told Daddy spent a few years in the dog house."" ""I bet."" Edward imagined what his father would look like if someone showed up with a love child. His mom played college softball and still kept her bat around. ""So they had a DNA test done?"" ""Momma said no. Daddy's name was on the birth certificate, and Rose didn't have any other family. She would have gone to the state."" Edward nodded, thinking how forgiving Bella's mother must be. ""That was…nice of her."" ""Family takes care of family round here."" They ate, watching the baby goats rambling and but into each other. Edward didn't want to destroy this bucolic scene, but there was some vital information he needed to know, and he couldn't exactly ask his boss. ""Emmett is married to someone else?"" Bella shook her head. ""Emmett and Rose were together forever, then they had one of their fights. He took off with a jug of shine, came back three days later with a wife. He claims the marriage was never consummated, his…"" Bella cleared her throat and raised her eyebrows, ""wife disagrees. She wants to hang onto his sorry ass, and all he wants is Rose."" Curiosity satisfied, Edward felt he needed to swing this conversation out of the hillbilly history channel. He pointed to the pasture. ""How'd did you get started with all this?"" ""A 125-gal KleenFlo vat, a stainless steel four lever press/drain table, two-curd harps & stir tools; forty forms of various sizes, stainless steel sinks, scales, a vacuum packer, UV light water purifier…"" He stared. She laughed. ""Oh that's not what you meant? Gramps left me the farm. Rose created the web site and does all the accounting, Alice designed the packaging, makes the soaps and helps with shipping and corporate accounts."" ""And what's your position?"" He took a big bite of toast. He couldn't get enough of the tangy cheese. ""I expanded the herd, hired staff, try new recipes."" She leaned even closer, until their knees were touching and her hands were braced on his thigh. ""But my favorite job is taste tester. And you've got some right here."" Her tongue was on his lips before he could comprehend what she was doing. Her firm touch traced all along his lips then swept inside. He gave no resistance, and started to kiss her back as her hands worked through his hair. His hands were drawn to the curve of her hips, pulling her further onto his lap. He tried to resist, but he had to see if her breast felt as good as it looked. He slid his hand up under her shirt, the warm weight of her overfilling his fingers. He squeezed, then kneaded around to toy with her nipple, rolling it under his palm. She moved away from his lips, allowing him a deep breath, but she didn't resume the kiss. He panted, ""What's the matter?"" ""There's something hard sticking into my hip."" ""I'm sorry, I don't usually react so quick, you're just so—"" Laughing. She's laughing, he thought, never a good sign. ""Your holster is sticking into my hip, not your…"" She laughed some more as she stood up, looking down into his lap. Edward took his hands off her body and started to get up. ""I should go back on patrol."" ""You should."" Bella reached over for the dishes. ""Why don't you come back for dinner? Out of uniform. You could help me milking. You surely have the hands for it."" He tried to keep his eyes from her breasts when she mentioned milking. He just nodded and swallowed, hoping his voice wouldn't squeak like a teenager. ""What time do you milk the goats?"" ""Second thing in the morning."" He was about to ask her what the first thing was when the radio squawked, something about a missing cow. He thumbed at his vehicle. ""I gotta go."" ""Hurry back."" He stumbled to the Explorer, licking his lips for the last vestige of taste. Her taste, the cheese, it didn't much matter. He'd be back for more tonight. Who said small towns were boring?

And now that he thought of it, it occurred to him that it was that same contradictory, inexplicable need that'd pushed him to follow Tanya into her room and share something of his with her. It was that same need that'd made him pack his suitcase and travel across the ocean without a second thought. Now it was clear to him that though caution was a virtue, fear was not. ""Today's bread does not eliminate yesterday's hunger, much less that of tomorrow,"" he muttered, speaking the words from memory. The woman looked up suddenly, and Edward's breath stalled in his lungs, his mind taken off the swirl of gathering reflections and realizations that'd surrounded his head. She was, he could say with certainty, unusually and… breathtakingly beautiful— not like Tanya, who was also lovely in her own way, but like something out of one of his reveries, with hair the color of fallen chestnuts and a pale face that seemed to have been shaped into a heart. A face that bore a confused expression and just the lightest, most endearing blush. ""Excuse me?"" ""It's a quote,"" he said, trying only slightly to tear his gaze away from the dark depths of her wide brown eyes, ""from the book you're reading."" The woman— or the girl, whom he reckoned to be around his age or just a tad older— glanced down at the hardback in her hands as if she'd suddenly remembered that it was there, and he was struck by a tickling curiosity, a need to know if there was any chance at all that she had also seen something beyond the usual pattern of her daily life. ""Oh,"" she breathed out, her eyes travelling down quickly and landing on her chest. Edward followed her gaze, allowing it to wander across the expanse of white skin below her collarbones towards the soft, minute lint on her shoulder, glinting golden in the mid-morning sunshine. ""It's a lovely book."" There was just the barest hint of sarcasm dripping through her voice, like a glimpse of what she was like beneath her coy demeanor, and he felt a pressing desire to see another dozen glimpses, to lean closer and lay his fingertips on the swell of her cheekbone, and as his gaze strayed to the gentle bow of her upper lip, to— Touch his mouth to hers. Taste her. ""It is... a bit disgusting, admittedly, in some parts."" She snickered, and a dimple appeared just below the side of her mouth as her eyes crinkled at the corners. A slow, beguiled smile tugged at the edge of Edward's lips, and he thought that in some way that was a glimpse of himself, too, a window into his gratitude for the unsought genuineness of her manner. ""I've read cruder things,"" she said, leaning closer to him over the railing of her balcony, and Edward moved towards her, too, his stomach clenching in the face of this sudden proximity, this strange magnetism that was quite possibly not real outside his head and which, all at once, scared him and reached out for the space in his chest that he thought couldn't be filled again. ""Besides, Baltasar Seven-Suns and Blimunda Seven-Moons are just lovely, so bare of any reservations when they're together, so…"" ""Simple,"" he finished. So simple and yet so complex , he added in his head, wondering about the contradictory nature of her allure. So shy and yet so open with a voice that was all at once sweet and tinged with subtle traces of sardonic humor. Edward moved closer still, watching her vibrant gaze flicker up to his and dance between the angles of his face. ""Moon, where are you?"" he quoted, and her eyes widened, dark brown orbs flashing under the long sweep of her lashes. ""Sun, where are you going?"" A smile crept slowly onto their faces where the growing sunlight shone softly, mellowing out the edges of their features. She held out her hand after a moment, and he took it in his, feeling the warmth of her touch melt onto his skin. ""I'm Bella,"" she said, and the name echoed in his head like a mantra. ""And you?"" Suddenly, he invoked the previous night. The almost natural fear that whatever followed his introduction to Tanya would wind up in tatters, shred by a mistake on his or her part or by a rushed decision to get too close, too attached, and eventually too badly burnt or too deeply marked by the guilt of having burnt her instead. He invoked all of this and more— the two-second-long bond between him and a child on the street when he lowered his head for her to hit it with a hammer and then hit hers in return; Heidi's slight narcissism showing through her words as he listened to her speak; the acrid burn in his throat as he took a sip of the vodka; the tolerable regret over having sex with Tanya as he lay in bed with her minutes afterwards… The world was so flawed and so beautiful, and he wasn't afraid anymore. ""Edward. My name is Edward."" Because there was always a chance that he would disappoint this girl, this beautiful woman whom he never wanted to hurt, just like there was a chance she would disappoint him as well, but in the end he thought— no, he was sure that he could work with that, because… He could work with that, because even if they let each other down a little, he knew neither of them would let the other fall. Bella smiled again, a radiant smile that made him feel his heartbeat on the side of his neck. ""It's lovely to meet you, Edward."" ""It's lovely to meet you, too, Bella.""

The wardrobe is almost as big as the entirety of the old London apartment Bella left behind not so long ago. Mr. Jefferson could open a store, Bella thinks, with a collection this size. But it feels like charity, and it feels like pity. ""I cannot,"" Bella says firmly, trying to slip her hands from Mr. Jefferson's hold. James reaches out with one of his shovel-like hands and seizes a handful of the back of Bella's frock. She whimpers as she is wrenched backwards into him. ""Strip,"" he says lowly, and then pushes her into the wardrobe. Mr. Jefferson shuts the door behind her. There is a velvet dress laid out on an ottoman in the centre of the room. It is green like emeralds, with a slimming bodice, and sensuously figure-hugging. Outside, James pounds on the door, ""Quickly!"" Bella bites her lip, uncertain. She touches the sleeve of the dress and feels the fabric slipping through her fingers. It will be the most glamorous thing she will ever wear in her life, she is sure of that. Bella hesitates for a moment, torn between temptation and good sense. She gives in. The dress looks scandalous on her. The bodice is tight, too small for her breasts. She couldn't tie the lacings in the back. Mr. Jefferson's ex-wife must have been unhealthily thin. Bella cups her hands over her breasts, threatening to spill over the top of the bodice lace. Her braided hair has slipped from their pins earlier, and two long strands rest upon her shoulder. The emerald brings out a hue of deep sensual chestnut in Bella's usually boring brown hair that she didn't know she had. She skims her fingers down the side of her hip, stroking the soft velvet, and feeling her stomach tighten. She's never felt like this before. She feels beautiful. What if she had walked into the dining room in this dress tonight? Dr. Masen would glance over as he did, and his eyes would stay, like fish that have found the hook at the end of the worm, and would he smile at her, as he had smiled at Mme. Poussard? If Bella could curl her hair, or if she had necklaces with pendants of gold, like the Mme, resting between her breasts, or if she had eyelashes like feathers and a laugh like clinking glass… ""Lovely."" Bella jumps, spinning around. She feels her face reddening, imagining how long Mr. Jefferson must have stood there for, watching her wrapping her arms around herself, running her hands up and down her sides… ""I'm sorry, Mr. Jefferson,"" Bella says hastily, trying to tie the laces in her back, ""forgive my indecency. I am too fat for such a dress."" ""No,"" Mr. Jefferson says softly, his eyes are warm, and his smile is kind, ""you are perfect. My wife was sick much of her life, and thin as a twig. You have a real woman's body. Do you know how many noble ladies would be envious of your figure and your darling face?"" Bella could not help but smile a little to herself, looking down at the carpet. Mr. Jefferson lifts Bella's fallen strands of hair and meets her eye. His dark eyes have a look in them that Bella cannot comprehend, and his moustache curls up as he smiles widely. ""Keep this dress,"" he says quietly and clearly, as if he isn't drunk at all, ""it is truly gorgeous, befitting you."" It might have been his gloves, his manner, and that courteousness – Bella starts to think that she has met a true gentleman. Then he kisses her. Bella freezes. Mr. Jefferson tastes like strong liquor and shaky breaths. He embraces Bella, whiskers pricking her lips, and sticks his tongue in her mouth, lapping at her like a dog. Bella stands there rigidly, shocked. Her mind is blank with shock. Mr. Jefferson breaks away, strings of saliva dripping from his moustache, and trails kisses down Bella's neck. At the bulge of her breasts, he plants a loud, wet kiss. Bella squeals and snaps out of her trance, pushing Mr. Jefferson away with all her might. The old gentleman stumbles backwards two steps and reaches for her again. ""Do not fret, my dear, your husband is out cold. Your indiscretions are safe with me."" Bella looks at Mr. Jefferson, aghast. ""My indiscretions? What about yours?"" Mr. Jefferson grins. ""You are a married woman, Mrs. James. You are the temptress, and I am your bewitched victim."" ""I am no temptress! You assaulted me!"" Bella cries. ""You sighed with pleasure when I kissed your breasts,"" Mr. Jefferson counters. ""Come, my dear, cast away your mask of virtuousness, for I know what you truly are."" She swats at his hand. ""Away from me, Mr. Jefferson!"" Bella side steps him as he tries to block her way. She rushes out the wardrobe, almost tripping over James, who is splayed on the ground, passed out. As she pushes open the heavy oak doors of Mr. Jefferson's office, she comes face to face with the very last person she wants to see. Edward Masen stands with one hand raised, like he is about to knock. His green eyes flicker down to her. He seems confused for a moment as he sees the look on her face. Then his gaze lower, following the line of her neck to the swell of her cleavage and the shimmering dress. His countenance is suddenly closed and unreadable. Bella pushes past him roughly. She feels tears welling in her eyes and wipes them quickly with one hand, picking up her hem with the other. Without a backward glance, she runs out of the office, down the staircase, and out into the moors. Please remember to leave the author some love.

""So you're saying that if I don't want to have a fake relationship with you, then I should have a fake relationship with one of your girlfriends."" ""Err, yeah?"" ""The whole thing is disturbing.

Emmett shouts as I walk down the steps of the campus fitness center. I turn around to grab the tossed object, but Emmett's aim is slightly off so I have to reach back to get them. As I'm reaching, I feel my elbow hit something soft. ""Oof"" is all I hear as I swear, ""Oh shit."" I turn around and I see the most gorgeous brunette scowling at me. Rubbing her chest. ""Dude. You whacked me in the boob,"" she says. I blink as I stare longingly at said boob being caressed by her slender, pale fingers. I'm speechless, which doesn't happen to me often. I also may be sporting a semi. Which may be slightly inappropriate considering the circumstances, but it's been a long time and she's really hot. ""This is what I get for actually attempting to work out. I'm going to kill Alice. I should've stayed home and worked on my new app. Imagine being sore before I even get on a machine,"" she mutters, walking away. It gives me a great view of her ass which is equally spectacular. Thank you, spandex shorts. ""Thanks a lot,"" she adds, making me snap out of my hot girl haze. ""Fuck...I'm so sorry! I hope your boob-er, breast is okay,"" I call out after her. She turns around to glance at me. She snorts and shakes her head. ""Can I pay for your doctor bill?"" I say, hopefully. ""Nothing's damaged, right?"" ""Oh my god, my implant ruptured!"" she cries out, holding her chest. ""What...no...I'll call 911...fuck...should I apply pressure?"" I reach out for her chest, and she grabs ahold of my hands. She starts laughing. ""I'm messing with you. Geez. Like these are implants."" She gestures to her chest. ""But they're really perfect,"" I mumble. ""You're perfect."" She blushes. She looks even better with pink cheeks. ""I'm really sorry I hit you and then stood there like an idiot."" ""No harm done. They'll be lopsided forever, but they weren't seeing much action anyway."" Again I gape at her chest. She laughs and walks off. ""Still messing with you."" I'm standing there watching her walk into the fitness center when my two friends join me. ""Pleases mess with me again,"" I call out, weakly. What the fuck just happened? ""Nice pull, Ed,"" Emmett says. ""There was no pull...I mean not that kind. I just hit her."" ""What the hell?"" exclaims Jasper. ""I didn't mean it that way. I accidentally elbowed her in the chest - when this idiot chucked my keys. And then I just stood there because she was so...well, you could see her. And she was funny and smart too. Fuck."" ""Dude I'm sure you'll get another chance to talk to her, I mean she's our-"" Jasper says before being interrupted by Emmett. ""She's a student here, so I bet we'll see her again,"" he says, nudging Jasper. ""Right?"" ""Yeah,"" Jasper says. ""Maybe sooner than you think."" Please remember to leave the author some love.

70,4,18,4-MeetTheMateContest-18.txt,twilight,MeetTheMateContest,"message from CattleMan620. I don't open it until late that night. I can't bring myself to read what I know it'll say. When I finally do, I see it's an apology from Emmett. He explains all of his reasons to me and asks me to please understand. I know he was just trying to do a nice thing, but I can't let it go. I'm sorry, Emmett. I can't. - CountrySwan I close my FarmersOnly account, delete the app from my phone, and try my hardest to forget about Emmett, Edward, and those loopy swirls in my grade book that say Bella Cullen. -0-0-0-0-0- It's Memorial Day, and I've just come home from being at Alice's all day. Jasper wanted to barbecue and introduce me to his cousin, Liam. He's nice, but I'm not interested in him or moving to Texas. Plus, I'm still hung up on a certain cattle man I'll most likely never meet. I've tried to forget him, but it's not possible. Every time I hear a cheesy pick-up line, I think of Edward. Every time I drive past the cows at the dairy farm on my way to work, I think of Edward. When Alice pulled out that damn jalapeño jelly at the barbecue today, I thought of Edward. He just won't go away, and it's driving me crazy. And he's making me want to drive back to Sheridan, which is ridiculous. Right? I'm only home a few minutes when there's a knock on my door. I'm not expecting anyone, so when I look through the peephole, I about fall over from shock. My heart starts racing, and I have to breathe deeply and count to ten before I'm calm enough to open the door. When I finally do, I find Edward Cullen standing on my doorstep, holding a pint of ice cream in his hands. The look on his face tells me he's just as nervous as I am. We stare at each other for what seems like five minutes. Maybe it's not quite that long, but it is a long time. I know that much. Finally, he clears his throat, and I see his Adam's apple bob when he swallows. ""Hello. I'm Edward Cullen."" ""I know,"" I manage to squeak out. ""You're Bella Swan, right?"" I nod. And yeah, he's a tenor. ""Um, first of all, I'd like to apologize for my brother. He means well, but he's not the brightest bulb in the box, if you know what I mean."" I nod again, because I do know what he means. I press my teeth into my bottom lip to keep my mouth from hanging open as I watch him fidget. The way my hands are gripping onto the door probably makes it clear how nervous I am, but he doesn't say anything. He just nods in response and continues speaking. ""Second, I brought this ice cream as a peace offering. I really hope you'll hear me out before you slam the door in my face."" I look down and wonder how he knew what to get. It's the perfect choice. ""It looks like Ben & Jerry's Chocolate Fudge Brownie, so..."" I can't say no to that. I just shrug my shoulder and look back up into his pretty green eyes. He smiles, and I swear I think the sun just got brighter. ""I got your address from Alice. She called my mom about her jalapeño jelly. My mom begged her for it,"" he says, shaking his head. ""I think she offered up a free case or two of the jelly, so please don't be upset. I'm sorry I didn't come here sooner. I thought you probably wouldn't want to talk to me."" There's a little sadness in his eyes when he says that, and it hurts my heart that he thinks my ending things was about him. ""Emmett's an idiot, but he really did have good intentions."" ""Yeah, I guess."" He half-laughs, and it's the sweetest sound I've ever heard. ""I read through all of your messages with Emmett, and they really are my words. Bella, it's up to you, and if you say no, I'll completely understand, but I'd love to take you out sometime. Maybe now, if you'd like. I wanna get to know you for real. I think maybe this could be something, if I'm not too late."" He's anxious, shifting his weight from one denim-clad leg to the next. Then I notice the brown cowboy boots. Oh, the boots... My heart's thumping so loudly in my chest that I'm shocked Edward can't hear it. It's practically screaming out to him. Honestly, it's belonged to him ever since that first message. I know as I look at Edward that I'll never get it back, and I don't want to. I want whatever might happen between us, and I need to give it a chance to be real, to last. I smile, wondering how I can show him in more than just words that I want exactly what he's asking for. A thought crosses my mind, and I have to hold back a laugh. Reaching for the carton of ice cream, I bat my lashes at him and cock my head to the side. ""Are you from Tennessee? 'Cause you're the only ten I see."" His smile widens, and his fingers touch mine as we hold the little frozen tub between us, neither of us wanting to let go. He laughs a rich, hearty laugh before taking a step toward me and flashing me the most indecent, crooked smile I've ever seen. And when he speaks, his tenor voice is dripping with a sexiness I don't think I've ever heard before. ""Do you believe in love at first sight, or should I walk by again?""

No words are exchanged as their bodies sway from side to side and one of Eduardo's hands slides down her back to her hip. The song's sensual rhythm allows a sinuous tension to create between them, especially when their hips shift at the same time. During the second chorus of the song, Eduardo spins Bella, and stands behind her, wrapping her arms around his neck. Bella leans into Eduardo, and closes her eyes as he once again grips her hips, causing her to move in perfect harmony with him. Prince Royce's ""Te Robare"" begins then, causing Eduardo and Bella to shift and change positions once more. This song is a bit faster, so their bodies aren't as close as before, but the fervor in their movements remains the same. Eduardo's arms extend, spinning Bella and pulling her back into him, forming perfect figures as they undulate their hips. A few more songs play, although it isn't until Romeo Santos croons ""Eres Mía"" that the ambience surrounding Eduardo and Bella intensifies. The song's slow pulse allows both of them to continue the sensuous teasing they've been doing since they began dancing, which could almost be considered foreplay. To someone from a far it may not look like as such, but it's definitely how Bella feels about it. Although, suddenly, Bella begins to panic, causing her to pull away. What if she's getting all the wrong signals? What if she's looking too much into it? Bewildered, Eduardo asks, ""Is something wrong, Isabella?"" ""No."" Bella shakes her head. ""I just need to step outside for a bit. I need some air."" Eduardo isn't convinced, yet he doesn't press the issue. ""Okay,"" he sighs. ""I can go with you if you'd like."" ""I'd prefer to go alone, if that's all right,"" Bella tells him. ""I'll be right back; I promise."" ""Sure."" Eduardo nods, looking torn. ""I'll be at our table waiting for you."" Feeling terrible, Bella gives him a small smile. ""Thanks."" With that, she turns in direction of the bar's exit, walking swiftly until she reaches the sidewalk. "" You're so stupid,"" Bella says under her breath. ""Why did you have to ruin the moment? You were having such a great time! "" ""I'd like to agree, but I'm not okay with your first statement,"" Eduardo says, startling Bella. She turns immediately, facing him. ""Oh, my God, Eduardo, I didn't even hear or notice you behind me!"" Eduardo chuckles. ""That's because I was trying to be stealthy."" ""Well you did a great job,"" Bella says, laughing lightly before she looks down at her hands. ""Although, I don't understand why you followed me."" ""You looked really troubled, and I wasn't going to leave you in that state by yourself, even if you did ask me to give you some privacy,"" Eduardo explains. ""Besides, I have a feeling I had something to do with you being uncomfortable, so…"" ""It's not your fault—"" "" Then why did you leave? "" Eduardo interjects. ""We were having a good time; you said so yourself."" Bella gazes up at Eduardo, twisting her hands by her lap. ""I got scared,"" she confesses. ""About what? Did I do something wrong?"" ""No""—Bella shakes her head—""not at all."" ""Then what was it?"" Bella sighs. ""I felt I was imagining this connection we shared while we danced, and I don't know… it terrified me to think I was wrong."" ""Well, if it's the same connection I felt, then I understand."" Bella raises her brow. "" What are you talking about? "" ""What you felt when we were dancing? I felt it, too."" ""You did?"" ""Yeah—"" Eduardo nods, closing the distance between them ""—and I get it, it's fucking scary, right? Because you're going crazy, trying to explain to yourself that you're imagining things, but the attraction is there. You can't deny it."" Bella licks her lips as she nods. ""So, I'm not crazy, right?"" He shakes his head. ""Not at all,"" Eduardo says before leaning down to kiss Bella. He threads his hand in her hair and pulls her closer, kissing her deeper. Bella snakes her arms around his neck then, allowing herself to enjoy their kiss. And it isn't until after a couple of minutes that they finally pull away from each other. Eduardo briefly closes his eyes and sighs, cupping Bella's face. ""You want to hear something crazier than everything we've said?"" Bella nods. ""I've wanted to do that since yesterday—kiss you, I mean."" A chuckle escapes past her lips. ""I'm pretty sure I'd wanted that, too."" ""Now I'm wondering if we both have the same desires,"" Eduardo whispers, ""because if we do, we could have a lot of fun tonight."" Bella gazes at Eduardo's lips as she bites down on her own. ""What would that entail?"" ""Quédate conmigo esta noche, Isabella, y lo sabrás,"" he taunts, telling her to spend the night with him to find out. Bella thinks about it briefly. She's dying to accept his proposal, yet she doesn't want to come off as easy. It would be cliché to reply that she's never had a one-night stand before, even if it is true, so she refrains from doing so. However, when she gazes into Eduardo's eyes, she knows she's going to do the right thing by accepting. After all, wasn't that what she went to Rosarito for? To have an adventure? How could she do that if she wasn't willing to try new and exciting things? She would take the risk, consequences be damned. If anything else, at least she'd have the newest plot for her next book. Because as far as she was concerned, she already knew who her male protagonist would look like. Please remember to leave the author some love.

She could drink me under the table, and did so frequently, didn't actually date and enjoyed her life to the fullest. She was so much like me; there was no chance for us to ever be anything more. We had sex with no strings attached, and it was great — every time. ""No, Vic, I think we should lay low for the time being. Even though I'm not serious about the whole thing, I still need to look as if I were; otherwise I'll have to pay a contractual fee instead of getting the funds the guys and I need."" She knew what I needed the money for, and we were close enough as friends that she would support me in this, wholeheartedly. Regardless, she showed a playful little pout. ""Then I think we should make the best of tonight. Who knows when will be the next time you'll be getting some."" With a dark chuckle, she scooted down my body until I felt her hot little mouth around my already hard-again cock. Dammit, I'll miss this. ****TtK**** Finally, the big day had arrived. ""You sure you want to go through with this?"" Emmett, my best man, asked as I was fighting to bind my neck tie. Frowning in concentration, I did the last wind and stuck the end through. ""Sure I am. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for us to get the money we need. I'd be stupid to run now."" To be honest, I'd had to talk myself off the ledge a few times over the last several days, convincing myself that everything would work out and a starter marriage wouldn't ruin my life. And I wasn't only doing it for myself. I was sure, being in my shoes, the other two would do the same. Emmett sighed. I knew there was something he wanted to say, but I didn't want to hear it, so I didn't ask and, instead, turned toward the mirror to check my appearance for the last time. ""How do I look?"" I asked, feigning enthusiasm. ""Your clothes are great but your facial expression is that of a dead man walking."" Just then, we were interrupted by a knock on the door. ""Edward, are you ready? We're supposed to start in five,"" a production assistant I'd seen a few times already asked, sticking his head into the room. Taking a deep breath, I answered, ""As ready as I'll ever be."" With Emmett by me side, I entered the room where the wedding ceremony was supposed to take place. About fifty people were sitting in rows of white, cloth-covered chairs. The people on the left side I knew. They were my friends and family, with my parents sitting front and center. The right side of the nicely decorated aisle was occupied by people I'd never before seen in my life. They were all eyeing me speculatively; some with excited surprise, others with skepticism clear on their faces. There were also five cameras placed strategically around the room. That was something I had to get used to and fast. I took my designated spot in front of the altar with Emmett next to me, giving me all the support he could offer. I threw him a tight smile, which he returned, then focused my attention toward the double doors at the other end of the room. All of a sudden, the traditional wedding march started and the doors opened slowly, revealing first a giant Native-American man in his mid-twenties. On his arm was a petite woman. Her dark curls were pinned to the top and from the back of her head a long veil emerged. Only a few curled strands fell freely around her heart-shaped face, whose paleness accentuated her mesmerizing dark eyes, which were framed by long, dark lashes. As my gaze traveled downward, I noticed her shoulders were bare as the bodice of her dress was tight around her torso and down to her hips. From there, it flared out wider and flowed lightly to the floor. Around her waist, there was a twinkling belt that made her look even slimmer than she already was and enhanced her perfect curves. She was a vision. I was sure, had she been at the same bar or club as me, I'd have spotted her in a crowd of hundreds of people, because she would be the most beautiful woman in every room, and not in an artificial or forced way. She looked very natural, with only the smallest amount of makeup, but her beauty was mesmerizing. As my eyes roamed up her delectable body again, I noticed her gaze was fixated to the floor; her full, rosy bottom lip caught between her teeth as she bit down hard on it. The man who was supposed to walk her to me leaned down and whispered something into her ear, which made her look up at me and gasp as her eyes widened in shock for a second. The corners of her mouth began to twitch upward, and they finally started their slow approach toward the altar and … me. My stomach was doing somersaults; my blood racing in my ears. This woman resembled nothing like Frankenstein's Bride. She was gorgeous — and supposed to be mine. They halted in front of me, and Native Guy released her hand, kissed her cheek, then sat down. The music stopped and my blushing bride — blushing indeed — smiled at me nervously as the celebrant started to speak. ""Isabella Swan, meet your husband-to-be, Edward Masen. Edward, this is Isabella, your bride."" Oh. My. God. She's perfect. How in the hell will I ever divorce her? Please remember to leave the author some love.

Digging a book of matches from his back pocket, he displayed it in front of Laurent's black, agony-filled eyes. He rubbed it between his fingers until it burst into flames, and then dropped the little fireball onto James' head. ""You need to remember that Major Jasper Whitlock allowed you to survive this day."" Seeing James' head being eaten away by flames, the redhead renewed her desperate fight to escape Emmett's hold. ""Noooo!"" she screeched when she freed her mouth. ""I'll kill you! I'll kill you all! While your bodies burn, I'll take your little human and drain her right in front of you!"" Jasper stalked toward them, absently dropping Laurent's head next to his body as he passed it. He quickly scanned the others. Carlisle was bent over Edward, having reattached his head, but his face was a picture of appalled bewilderment. Rosalie, standing over them, wasn't faring much better. Beyond them, Alice was sitting on the ground, holding Bella against her chest, and she was stroking the unconscious girl's hair. Esme appeared to be weeping into Alice's shoulder. Jasper returned his gaze to the struggling, snarling female. ""Your name."" ""I'll never tell you! I'll kill—"" In a flash, Jasper was crouched in front of her, his hand spread over the crown of her head. A deep growl rumbled through his chest as he increased the pressure with each deliberately enunciated word. ""Tell me your name."" ""Victoria!"" she shrieked. Her screams continued even after he drew his hand away, silvery venom dripping from his fingertips. Victoria paused to suck in another breath, and Emmett, uncertain and decidedly unsettled, blurted out, ""Are you going to kill her?"" ""You heard her. Let her up."" Without any hesitation, Emmett let go and scrambled away. Lightning split the sky, momentarily causing Victoria's writhing body to stand out in stark relief against the dull scrub grass. She wailed and dug at her cracked skull, her hair darkening as she bled. Jasper took another book of matches from his pocket. He plucked one loose, struck it, and tossed the miniature flaring missile onto the mass of venom-soaked, curling red hair. The resulting shrieks were ear-splitting. Victoria lurched to her feet and stared incredulously at the sputtering flames licking over her hands. The panic in her eyes flipped to depthless hatred, and she charged at Jasper, her grasping hands straining to reach him. In one fluid motion, Jasper's hand snaked out as he side-stepped her. Victoria's furious screams were abruptly silenced when her head tipped over and slowly began to roll down her back. Her decapitated body took two unsteady steps before flopping heavily to the ground. The fiery mass of rapidly disappearing curls bounced once and settled beside it. Purple-tinged flames quickly spread to her clothes. Dazed at the sudden, irrevocable carnage, Emmett shook his head and peered cautiously at Jasper. ""What the fuck was that, man? Do you always carry around matches?"" He shivered at the deadly calm in Jasper's eyes. ""Always."" Jasper pulled off his T-shirt and methodically wiped the foreign venom from his arms and fingers. ""They threatened my woman. They'll never do it again."" He balled up the shirt and lobbed it into the crackling, popping fire. Emmett shook his head again, but kept his eyes lowered. He was afraid to witness what else might be revealed in Jasper's eyes. ""How … the venom on your hands ... How did you keep from catching yourself on fire?"" ""Years of practice."" Scrubbing his palm over his face, Emmett mumbled, ""Holy shit. I've never seen anything like it."" ""Carlisle's kept you ignorant about the reality of this life—all of you. It's time you learned."" Jasper purposely strode toward the others. When he reached Rosalie, Carlisle, and Edward, he halted; hands propped on his belt, and stared down into Edward's terror-stricken face, but addressed the head of the family. ""Carlisle, you can put Laurent back together or not. That's up to you. He won't be a problem."" He sighed. ""Bella's father knows she's with Edward. It's simple, but it should work. Both of them, and Alice and I, dying in a car accident will explain our disappearance."" Carlisle finally found his voice. ""Disappearance? Alice and—?"" ""I'm leaving and I'm taking Bella with me. Alice is going with us."" ""But then Edward wouldn't be able to be seen—"" ""I don't care. You've done it before. You'll figure it out if you want to stay here a while."" Jasper leveled one finger at Edward. ""She's your singer not your love ."" Dismissing them, he continued toward Alice. ""Alice, I think it's time I properly meet Bella."" ""She's still out for the time being. She'll wake up on the way to your place. Unless you want to change her now?"" Alice's face lit up with an encouraging smile and her eyes twinkled. ""Whether you do it now or decide to wait, either way, she'll be a little upset at first, but she's going to love you."" ""She won't be the first newborn wanting to take a bite out of me."" The emotionless, stony face of the war-hardened vampire finally began to soften. The iron set of his jaw relaxed, the frigid black of his irises melted away to warm gold, and the rigid tension drained out of his body. At long last, the young man he once was appeared as he knelt on one knee to take his young mate into his arms. He cradled her tenderly to his chest and tucked her head under his chin. Gradually rising, he slowly breathed in her scent, nuzzled her hair, and closed his eyes with a contented sigh. ""It's so nice to finally meet you."" Please remember to leave the author some love.

With that and him knowing how she felt at all times, it allowed for…matters to progress between them extremely fast."" By the end of his explanation, even the tips of poor Edward's ears were pink. Bella was certain that she must be as red as a tomato by now. ""That strange sensitivity? When we shook hands? Was that…?"" ""Hypersensitivity to each other,"" he interrupted quickly. ""Our gifts probably amplify any small attraction…shit, this is awkward."" He ran his hand through his already messy hair. Bella strove frantically to corral her thoughts. Closing her eyes and taking a couple of deep breaths, she mentally chanted, It's OK, we'll work it out…we'll work it out…it's not a bad thing…we'll work it out… ""Bella, please open your eyes,"" begged the man across the table. His voice was gentle, understanding. When she did, he continued, ""You're right, we'll work it out. We're both highly intelligent adults, and, I think, budding friends?"" Bella had to smile at the hopeful note in his voice. ""Yes, we are. And as your new friend I'm going to tell you to finish that brownie."" Edward laughed. Bella beamed at the sight. Edward's emotions held a perpetual melancholy undercurrent, as if he somehow felt that he couldn't be truly happy. She'd encountered the same emotion in people who had lost someone they loved dearly, or those who somehow felt undeserving of love in the first place. It saddened her to think that Edward fit into either of those categories. They chatted about lighter topics for a few minutes before Edward's cell phone vibrated. Casting Bella an apologetic look, he reached into his pocket and answered. ""Hello? Yes, I'm in a café."" By his increasing anxiety level, something was definitely wrong. Edward raised an index finger, meeting Bella's worried dark eyes as his listened. Then he stood up, grabbed his jacket, turned and walked a few steps away. It would be odd if she didn't know how stressed he was. Bella quickly put on her windbreaker and backpack, gathered the empty cups and plates, and placed them into the used dish tubs. She could just barely make out what he was saying. Fortunately, her hearing was exceptionally good. ""What about the woman with me? Is it after her? Or is she the danger?"" He faced Bella again, subtly gesturing for her to follow him. He walked confidently to the back of the store. ""Good, because there's no way in hell I'm leaving her behind."" Edward's velvet voice was now a growl. ""Thanks, Al."" He closed the phone and stuffed it into his back jeans pocket. He then cast her a pleading glance, as if willing her to read his mind, before casually heading toward the employee exit at the rear. Bella didn't even hesitate. Even if she couldn't detect Edward's urgency laced with fear, she knew they had to get out of there. There was something off…heavy…approaching, and her instinct was to flee. The pair didn't speak as they moved quickly across the rear parking lot in the misty drizzle. We need to get to a busy street , she thought. Dammit, it looks so far away! Edward forced himself to calm down. There was no point in making his new friend panic. Bella had been staring determinedly at the approaching street, willing it to hurry up and get to them. Now she glanced up at the man walking next to her. ""We'll make it,"" he assured her softly, slightly out of breath from the pace they were keeping up. Bella nodded. She could tell he was right. ""Which way?"" she asked when they reached the sidewalk. Edward hesitated. ""I think we evaded whatever that was. I'll take you home. I've probably done enough damage for one day."" ""What?"" What does that mean, wondered Bella . What damage? There's no way he's escaping without an explanation of what just happened. Then her insecurities took over. Stupid, she chastised herself. He had no intention of talking with you in the first place, remember? He's obviously had enough of your company. Bella's stomach twisted painfully at that last thought. ""Whoa! Where are you going in such a hurry?"" Edward hand on her elbow brought her to a halt. ""You keep forgetting that I can read your thoughts, don't you?"" Damn! Yes, I do. Edward's dazzling grin flashed briefly before he became serious again. ""Bella, I'm not trying to get away from you."" He blew out a tense breath. ""That was my friend Alice who called. She had a vague glimpse of me having coffee with a young brunette woman, when suddenly a large dark cloud approached, threatening to engulf us."" Dark cloud? That drew Bella's attention from the pleasant tingling in her arm where he still held her. ""I felt it,"" she confirmed with a small frown. Unconsciously she stepped closer to Edward. ""It was heavy, ominous. Could you hear anyone?"" He shook his head slowly, replaying the scenario in his mind. ""Now that you mention it, it is odd that I didn't hear anyone."" ""Has this happened before?"" ""No, not like this. What about to you?"" ""No."" Edward released her arm and took a small step back. Bella didn't need her gift to interpret the pained expression on his face. ""Bella, this is wrong. I can't get you involved. I don't know what I was thinking…"" He took a couple more steps back. There it was, more pronounced this time. The sense of utter loneliness and melancholy. Usually so careful to think things through, this time Bella made one of the few snap decisions of her life. You were thinking that you could finally be yourself, she thought to him. Let's go to my place, and you'll tell me about the Institute. Please remember to leave the author some love.

Edward's kiss was possessive, consuming, exactly what I'd pictured when I'd allowed myself to imagine what it would be like to give in to my desires. Then the realization of what I was doing seeped in, piercing me with icy slivers of guilt. The hands I had been using to draw him closer turned to push him away, breaking our connection. ""Edward,"" I choked. ""I can't."" ""You can,"" he insisted. "" We can."" ""You're leaving. Jasper wants to marry me. I just..."" ""Bella - "" I was pushing up and off the chaise before he could say more. My sudden departure startled him, and I was nearly to the door before he even was able to call after me. But by then, I was pushing past a confused Rosalie and Granddad, out the front door, and to my car. I watched in my rearview mirror as Edward skidded to a stop on the porch, and even though I couldn't see his face, the slump of his shoulders just drove the knife in my heart that much deeper. o-o-o-o-o-o I holed up in my townhouse for the rest of the weekend, ignoring the ringing phone, wallowing in my confusion. My head was telling me I should agree to marry Jasper. After all, we'd been together a while, and on paper he was perfect: he was well educated, had a steady job with Dad's law firm, and he was very kind. But then my heart got into the mix and reminded me that he was also boring, and uptight, and I had never felt anything with him remotely like what that I'd felt in that kiss from Edward. I pressed the heels of my hands into my eyes until colors bloomed behind my eyelids, then stood up, deciding a glass or three of wine would be the best way to solve my problems. As I crossed my living room, I noticed an envelope sitting on the floor of my foyer. My name was written in elegant script on the front, but there were no other markings to indicate where it was from. Opening the flap carefully, I slipped the single sheet of stationery out of the envelope. My sweet Bella, I thought my life was perfect, that I had exactly what I'd always wanted. And then the most extraordinary thing happened: you whirled into my life, and turned everything upside down. It was the best thing to ever happen to me. I hadn't even realized how lonely and gray my life had become. But now I know, because you have brought warmth and laughter and color and light to me, and I know I can never go back. It's as if I were Dorothy in Kansas, and you hurtled me into Oz. I will be back in two weeks. I'm hoping, selfishly, that I can convince you to wait until I return so I can try to persuade you in person. I know I have no business asking this of you, but please, do not agree to marry Jasper, not until I've had my chance to prove to you how extraordinary we can be together. If I have learned anything from Rosalie, it's that when you find something extraordinary, you need to fight for it. You are extraordinary, and I am fighting for you. Yours, Edward I swiped the tears that had trailed down my cheeks as I read his words, and took a deep breath. I knew what I had to do. o-o-o-o-o-o I hurried through the park, my eyes scanning frantically around me. Where are they? They have to be here. There. On the path ahead of me were Rosalie and Granddad. Behind them, with his hands buried deep in his pockets, looking like a man who'd lost the most important thing in his life, was Edward. I rushed forward, trying not to stumble on the uneven ground. ""Edward!"" He lifted his head and looked around. When his eyes landed on me, his eyebrows shot towards his hairline and he looked like he couldn't decide if he should smile or not. ""Bella?"" I launched myself at him, and his arms automatically lifted to catch me as his eyes widened in shock. ""Wha?"" was all he managed to get out before I tugged his mouth down to mine. At first his lips were stiff with surprise, but as I continued my assault, he softened and then, with a groan, gave in and kissed me back. Suddenly, he pulled away. I whined in protest but he wouldn't be deterred. ""What... I mean... you... Jasper?"" I shook my head at him. ""I got your letter. After that, I knew... I gave Jasper back his ring. I'm willing to try for extraordinary,"" I murmured. The words had just barely passed my lips before his mouth was claiming mine again, hard and insistent. I returned his kiss just as fervently. Slowly, our surroundings seeped into my consciousness, and I could hear Granddad and Rosalie laughing and clapping. I grudgingly pulled away, though I stayed nestled against Edward's chest. ""Told you it would work,"" Granddad chuckled. ""You helped?"" I asked incredulously. Granddad just grinned at me. ""You meddled in my love life, so I figured what was good for the goose was good for the gander. You complaining?"" ""Actually, I think I owe you."" ""I'd say we're even,"" he argued, drawing Rosalie close. ""Thank you, Granddad,"" I murmured, nuzzling against Edward again. His arms tightened around me and he pressed a kiss to the top of my head. As we began walking again, I smiled to myself. Who'd have thought a dress could change the course of my life? Please remember to leave the author some love.

76,4,40,4-MeetTheMateContest-40.txt,twilight,MeetTheMateContest,"out in the clear night and only someone like me can know the pain that this simple question caused. ""I'm sorry, Edward. What did you say?"" ""I didn't say anything. I didn't have to; some girl named Jessica did it for me."" Oh fuck. ""She told your whole, sad, tragic, little story? ""Yep, right down to the last detail."" Edward's brother was born with Spina Bifida. He couldn't talk much and couldn't walk at all. That's why Edward is so strong; he carried Jake everywhere. ' But he wasn't a burden like some people think. He was smart too; he knew a lot about everything; he just couldn't communicate it very well. Jake wasn't supposed to live past his first birthday, but he did, he lived for ten of them. I hated when people called him special. He was special, but not because he had cognitive or physical issues or anything like that; Jake was special because he is/was my brother.' I understood that better than anyone really. Even though Garrett was a pain in the ass, he was my pain in the ass. ""Hey, Bella?"" ""Hmm?"" I glance over at his alabaster face and feel something pass between us. It's a warm, glowy feeling. Like a slow current that is building towards something infinitely greater. ""If we hadn't slammed into each other that day in the funeral home, do you think we still would have met?"" I mull it over for a long minute before I respond. Would we have met? I don't know. Forks is a small town, but we go to different schools, live in different neighborhoods, and travel in different social circles. ""I think we would,"" he says, answering for me. ""Maybe."" He turns to his side and his face is so close to mine that I can smell his breath. It's minty, as if he just brushed his teeth; I long to kiss that mouth. Just for informational purposes, of course. But I can't It's not like that between us . ""Do-do you think if our brother's hadn't died that we'd still be friends? "" He is stammering now and I'm puzzled; what point is he trying to make? Edward never stammers or stutters; he is always relaxed and self-assured. I sit up and look at him. His hair is blowing in the wind and it's sticking up all over the place, covering his eyes. I want to tuck that hair over his ear and then kiss it; he has the prettiest ears; small and pink. ""I hope so,"" I say. My heart is beating fast and that current is so charged now that I suspect my own hair is about to take flight. ""I brought something else to share with you tonight."" ""Another toy?"" ""No."" ""A memory?"" He shakes his head, sits up, and digs something out of the pocket of his faded denim jeans. He hands it to me and I hold it up in the moonlight. It's a pair of concert tickets to see Bare Naked Ladies . ""Will you go out with me? To-to the concert I mean. They're playing in Seattle, it's an outdoor concert. I know they're not that popular anymore, but you like them … I mean … I think you do … you sang that song to me at Berty's and …"" He is stumbling all over his words and I've never seen him look more flustered or sweeter. ""I'd love to,"" I tell him, quickly. He lets out a huge sigh of relief and bites his lip. Lord, do I ever want to bite that lip. That's all I've thought about the last six months; in between thinking about my dead brother, of course. ""I don't want to go with you as members of the DBC,"" he clarifies. ""Okay?"" ""I-I don't know how you feel about me other than I'm the guy you met at our brothers' visitations. I know we can't change the way we met. I know it's weird. But even if I'd met you at the grocery store in the canned beans section, I'd still want to ask you out."" This time I do allow my fingers to brush his coppery curls off his forehead. I trace the plane of his face and for a second he rests his cheek in the palm of my hand and I feel like I am holding something precious, like his heart. He leans into me and presses his mouth against mine and I feel the current explode into a rainbow of color over our heads. It's corny and way over the top, but it's lovely and sort of magical too. I run my fingers through his hair and smile into his mouth. Our teeth scrape together because he is smiling back at me. And that's when I realize that this is the first time I've felt happy, truly happy, in the last six months. I almost didn't recognize it as first, hence the hyperbole. I'm happy. We lay back on the rooftop and he deepens the kiss. His tongue introduces itself to mine and they're pleased to meet each other. Then he lifts his leg over my hip and we lay there for half an hour just kissing and giggling and being, well, happy together. He looks down at me and places a kiss gently on my forehead, grinning from ear to ear. And that's when I realize that maybe; just maybe, there is a heaven after all. And maybe, just maybe, Gar is up there now, swigging a Rainer and playing cars with Jake. And when I look back at the star in the sky and see the twinkle that mirrors the one in Edward's eyes, I think to myself Maybe it is like that between us, after all.

77,4,44,4-MeetTheMateContest-44.txt,twilight,MeetTheMateContest,"his next victim. I glance at Bella, and she's turned those wide brown eyes at me. I might be imagining it, but I think she almost looks disappointed. ""Hey,"" I murmur, leaning closer to her. ""Sorry, that was awkward. I know we're not... there yet."" ""It's not your fault,"" she reassures me. She looks like she's about to say something else, but she stops herself, biting her lower lip instead. If she's trying to convince me I made the right decision not to kiss her, that is not the way to go about it. It's also apparently the perfect way to make me lose my filter. ""I really want to, you know?"" Her eyes widen a little, but she doesn't say anything. ""Kiss you,"" I clarify unnecessarily. ""Edward,"" she breathes, and before I can decipher if her tone means she agrees and wants to kiss me, too, or she's about to shoot me down, Katie shrieks again and the crowd around us breaks out into loud laughter. I glance up at the screen again, and sure enough, that sadistic cameraman has focused back on Bella and me. Apparently my kiss for Katie wasn't good enough. Fine. I mean, I just told Bella I want to kiss her, and she didn't slap me or storm off, so maybe she's warming up to the idea? One way to find out, I guess. I lift a hand to cup Bella's jaw, making my intentions obvious before I lean in and brush my lips against hers. I vaguely hear the crowd cheer and clap, but I'm more interested in this gorgeous woman who is now kissing me back. I groan softly and press my lips harder against hers. It was supposed to be just a quick kiss to appease the crowd, but I'm completely lost in the taste of her, the way her soft, sweet lips feel beneath mine. It's not until Katie tugs on my sleeve that I realize we're still in the middle of the stadium. ""You guys can stop now,"" she scolds. ""The camera's not even on you anymore."" I press one last peck to Bella's lips before I pull back, keeping my hand on her jaw and sweeping my thumb over her lower lip. Her cheeks are flushed and I love that I'm the reason for that blush. I want to be the reason for that reaction over and over again. ""So does this mean you're willing to give me a shot as more than just a friend?"" I whisper. I can see the indecision in her eyes for just a moment before she takes a deep breath and nods gently. So, I do the only thing that makes sense: I press my lips to hers again, kissing her until Katie gets fed up with us and demands our attention. Bella keeps me at arm's length at first, tries to keep things between us casual, but I'm persistent. And I know a lot of her hesitation is because she doesn't want Katie to get hurt if things between us go sour, so I can't fault her for wanting to take things slow. It helps that Katie adores me, and does her part to convince Bella that I should be a part of their lives. So, little by little, I'm able to prove to Bella how much I want this, want her. That I'm not going anywhere. And when she finally invites me into her bed, and I slide into her velvety heat for the first time, I know. It's not my first time, and it's not her first time, but it's our first time, and I know this is where I belong, forever. The last time I meet Bella Swan... I'm pacing. I know I'm probably driving my brother crazy, but I've got too much pent-up energy to stand still. This is such an important day, but there's nothing I can do at this point but wait. I check my watch again, growling when only four minutes have passed since the last time I looked. ""You ok, bro? It's not too late to back out if you're having doubts,"" he offers. I know he's just trying to be helpful, but I glare at him for even suggesting it. He holds his hands up in surrender and I resume my circuit around the room. ""What if she doesn't show up?"" I whisper, voicing my biggest fear. ""Seriously?"" Alec scoffs. ""That's what's got you so wound up? Go take a shot of whiskey and man up."" With those incredibly inspiring words, he claps me on the shoulder and leaves the room. Asshole. Finally, my dad pokes his head through the door and tells me it's time. Oh fuck. This has been such a rollercoaster of a journey, and it's finally time. I follow Dad out, take my place, and wait. Again. But this time, there's a light at the end of the tunnel. She's the light at the end of the tunnel. Finally, finally, she's next to me, and even though we're in a room full of people, she's the only person I can see. Nothing else matters except the way she's smiling at me, the same joy in my soul reflected on her face. Our surroundings finally penetrate my consciousness when I hear the pastor say, ""I now pronounce you husband and wife. Edward, you may kiss your bride."" He doesn't have to tell me twice. I sweep her into my arms and slant my mouth over hers, claiming her as mine forever in front of all of our friends and family. When she pulls away, her face glowing with love and happiness, it completely overwhelms me. I am the luckiest man in the world. And that is the first time I meet Bella Cullen.

The girls at my table gasp, Edward's eyes widen in shock, and I hear a muttered "" bitch "" from somewhere across the room. The MC is the first to regain his composure and stammers if anyone wants to challenge my offer. Apparently, I just raised the stakes from a few hundred dollars into the thousands, and the women gathered aren't willing or able to fork over that large a sum for a date. All the better for me, and with a few words from the MC, the deal is done, and Edward is handed off to me. He descends the stage, moves around a few tables, and then he is standing in front of me, holding out his hand. ""Hey, I'm Edward,"" he says. ""Izzy,"" I reply, taking his hand. His eyes captivate me, but it's this first innocent touch that tethers me to him, making it almost impossible to break the handshake. Being this close to him, I can see his pupils dilate and the slight increase of his breaths. It could be the after-effects of having been in the spotlight before, but dare I hope he feels the same shift in atmosphere as I do? It's like the world around us is muted and slowed down, the only things registering the rapid beating of his heart, the feel of his hand in mine, and his scent of salt and cocoa butter. With it comes a sense of belonging I have never felt before. ""Do I know you?"" he asks. ""I doubt it,"" I say. ""I haven't been here in years."" Blindly, I reach for my glass to take a sip, and his eyes zero in on my lips when I lick them. He swallows, and I am irrationally fascinated by the way his Adam's apple bobs in his throat. A brief thought flickers through my head, wondering how his taste would feel on my tongue, but I am quick to brush it aside, knowing I cannot, and will not, think of him as a meal, or even a snack. The few words we have exchanged have already been enough to confirm at least one detail of the oracle: this man is destined for me. I will just have to figure out to what extent exactly, but I have a feeling it may run deep. Rosalie calls my attention, and I reluctantly pull my eyes away from the man in front of me to meet her concerned ones. She quirks an eyebrow knowingly as she whispers a warning, too low for the humans around us to hear. ""Be careful, child. You are drawing attention to us with the intensity between you."" Edward seems to have taken the momentary distraction to collect his thoughts, and he clears his throat. Unable to ignore him, I snap my gaze back to him. ""Would tomorrow morning at eight work for you?"" he asks. At some point, I must have missed part of the conversation because I have absolutely no idea what he's talking about. My confusion must be written on my face because he elaborates. ""I own a surf shop down the street, and part of your date with me is a private surf lesson. There's a decent swell coming in tomorrow, so we could meet at eight and try to catch a few waves before lunch. Have you surfed before?"" Though I have tried many things, surfing isn't one of them, and I shake my head as I smile. ""I'm sorry. I wasn't paying attention when they said that."" ""You're telling me you paid two thousand dollars for a date with me without knowing any of the fine print?"" He laughs, and I'm glad he seems to feel at ease enough to bring some banter to the table. ""Guilty as charged. I just had this feeling I had to get to know you…"" I trail off, not feeling too comfortable discussing this already, and in this setting. ""Anyway, I haven't surfed before, and I don't have a wetsuit, but I'm sure you're an amazing teacher, and eight is fine. Where do I meet you?"" He asks for a pen and scribbles something on a napkin, handing it to me. ""That's the name and address of my shop. And my number, in case you have trouble finding it."" He grins nervously, and I hurry to answer with a smile of my own. Our fingers brush against the other's as the napkin moves from his hand to mine, reigniting the exciting spark I felt at the first touch. I am itching to prolong the contact, to talk to him some more, but a high-pitched voice angrily calls his name, and his posture stiffens. The girl the voice belongs to calls out to him again, and he motions to her that he's coming. I don't even bother to acknowledge her because whoever she is, she is inconsequential to my mission. He looks back at me apologetically. ""I have to go. See you tomorrow?"" I nod, carefully placing the napkin with his details in my purse. ""I'll get Ben to refill your drinks, on me. Have fun tonight, and I'll see you tomorrow,"" he repeats. I follow his form as it moves across the club to where a short strawberry blonde in high heels is waiting for him impatiently. She looks like the epitome of Hollywood artificiality, and I wonder who she is to him. She catches him looking over his shoulder back at me and casts me a withering glare. The fiery orange glimmer in her eyes as she does so solidifies my intentions for the remainder of the night. The girl is a fellow witch, and she is using a lot of energy to keep a spell in place.

79,4,32,4-MeetTheMateContest-32.txt,twilight,MeetTheMateContest,"I'm free and I don't have to take any of the blame. I'm actually...relieved."" Her eyes go wide and she looks at me questioningly, so I explain to them I haven't been sure about me and James for a while. He's been acting...odd, and it's been tough trying to figure things out—especially after all the years I've spent with James—deciphering wedding jitters from actually questioning whether I'm with the right person till death do us part. But, now I can admit, that maybe I've made a lucky escape. We drink and talk it all through. It's cathartic in ways I didn't know I needed. *S* ""How come they don't make break ups easier?"" I whisper to Jess as I get ready for the onslaught of little faces. ""Because, I think if they did, no one would ever fight to stay together, you know?"" I shake my head and try to concentrate on anything beyond James. I don't want to fight, that's just it. I spent years with him, and even though it's weeks later and I can now acknowledge I'm better off without him in my life, it's still not easy dissolving a long-term relationship like that. The kids are a wonderful distraction from my conflicting emotions, though. We go through our normal routine before it's time for everyone to start going home. I'll admit, I'm going to miss them; I'm not ready for the day to end and to go home alone. ""Bella, do you think you could stay late for me? I already had plans after work, and we have a dad who's going to be a little late picking up his munchkin,"" Jess announces. ""Okay, which one?"" I wonder. ""Heidi. Do you mind?"" I shrug. ""No, not at all. But what happened to her grandmother who always does it?"" ""Esme called to say she's out of town, and her son, Heidi's father, is going to have to get her today, but that he's in class so he might be a little late."" I nod and say fine. That happens to us sometimes. It's part of Sunny Days Preschool; it caters to students at Arizona State University. But, I think about this guy... We've never met him; his mother always drops off and picks up Heidi. Esme has mentioned she helps him because he's sacrificed a lot for his daughter, and to get his college education. I commend him for that, and I'm curious to finally meet the guy. After all the other children have left, I set up Heidi with some paints. ""Who are you painting?"" I wonder, because I can tell it's supposed to be a man. ""My daddy. He's the bestest,"" Heidi states proudly, her blonde curls bouncing. ""Him and Nana take good care of me."" ""That's good, sweetie. I can tell you love your daddy very much."" She nods emphatically. ""Yes! And he says he loves me twice as much 'cause he's both my mommy and my daddy."" I find that interesting information, but don't say anything else. Heidi is just finishing up her painting when there's a knock on the door and I hear the passcode being punched in. ""Hi there."" I turn around to greet who I know has to be Heidi's dad. Only authorized people have the passcode to the preschool's door. ""You're here for this little princess?"" I smile and smooth Heidi's hair. ""Yes, Heidi Masen."" ""Hi, Daddy!"" Heidi yells and jumps on her father's leg. ""Hi, angel."" He bends down and hugs her, kissing her cheek. I grin at them. ""Okay, well, she's all ready."" Then my eyes meet his and I really take him in, and that's when I see it—the look on his face; the one that indicates he recognizes me too. Images from the night of my bachelorette flash through my head. His memorable eyes. His beautiful chest. His tattoo. His defined abs. His tight, leather pants. Where my hand once rested on his perfect body and hard cock as I brushed it through his thong. I feel my face flush as I look at Teddy standing in front of me, but before I can say anything, there's a tug on my leg. ""Yes, sweetie?"" I ask. ""Why you staring at my daddy?"" I let out a nervous chuckle. ""Uh..."" I clear my throat. ""I thought he looked like someone I met before."" She grins adorably, waving at her pretty painting still on the easel. I grab it and give it to her. ""Um, she made that for you,"" I say, as Heidi hands him her painting. He also clears his throat. ""Oh, that's incredible. Thank you, angel."" I melt momentarily as he touches her cheek, then snap back into daycare worker mode. ""I, uh, actually need to see your ID before you leave please. It's part of our security process. Since I...uh…don't know you and you had the passcode."" He nods and takes out his wallet, handing me his license. I confirm he's as handsome in his driver's photo as he is in person. And I may or may not take a good look at his address, smiling to myself that he only lives a few blocks over from me. I hand back his license. ""Thanks...Mr. Masen."" ""Edward, please. And you're welcome."" He grabs his daughter's things and heads for the door with her, but then turns around. ""Oh, and Bella?"" ""Yes,"" I answer, feeling a little stunned I now know his real name, and he remembered mine. ""I'll definitely be seeing you around, sweetheart."" His eyes find my naked ring finger before he gives me a bright smile and knowing wink that sends me into heart failure. With that, he closes the door, taking his gorgeous self and beautiful daughter with him. And I'm left a flustered mess. Please remember to leave the author some love.

80,0,26,0-LunaStellaCat-26.txt,harry-potter,LunaStellaCat,"you? You're married to Minerva, so I hope you do for your sake."" Elphinstone rolled his eyes. ""Yes. Two-thirty."" Malcolm nodded, whistling as he headed down the road. Agnes once described her Uncle Malcolm as a big teddy bear, and Elphinstone thought he understood the reference. Malcolm and Anne had three children, two girls and a boy. Anne was a Muggle matron he'd met in Glasgow, and Malcolm acted as the glue holding the McGonagall family together. Ever since their mother had passed, whenever he wasn't on assignment overseas, Malcolm stayed close to his father. Life filled the small house. When Minerva opened the back door, asking why he'd gone around the other way, Elphinstone took her in his arms and kissed her. The reverend, reading his paper and bouncing Ryan on his knee, pretended not to notice. He sipped his coffee. When Agnes shouted from the sitting room, laughing her head off with Christopher, he smiled for the first time that day. ""Do you want me to tell them to quiet down?"" asked Minerva. The manse was usually a quiet place with one occupant. ""No. I like it. It's nice to have family around."" Reverend McGonagall played with Ryan's hair. Elphinstone hated to bring this up, but he didn't want to leave it for tomorrow when the reverend would be focused on the sermon and the parishioners. ""How much do I owe you for the ceremony, sir?"" ""Nothing,"" Reverend McGonagall said. He chuckled and asked Minerva to show him the coffee containers in the cupboard. Minerva followed his instructions and opened the top cupboards. There were at least thirty or forty containers, some of them with their lids off. Maybe the reverend was a hoarder? Elphinstone did not understand. ""I have been saving for Minerva's wedding since she was five. Since the two of you decided to elope, and thank you for that, by the way, Elphinstone, I decided to focus on the granddaughter."" Elphinstone said nothing, rather touched by this gesture. Agnes shouted again, this time in triumph, and the reverend said, ""She found the key to the liquor cupboard. Agnes?"" ""Yes?"" Agnes called from the other room. She joined them a moment later with her husband and a bottle of unopened scotch. ""Clever girl, going for the aged stuff. Give it here, Aggie, and grab us some glasses."" The reverend took off his spectacles and rubbed his tired eyes. Agnes handed it over and went to the cupboard to grab some shots glasses; the reverend took them and poured with a generous hand, holding the bottle to the light afterwards. ""This is thirty years old, Aggie, it's older than you are. What are you doing with this?"" Minerva handed glasses to both Elphinstone and Christopher. ""Where'd you get it?"" ""Dunno,"" said the reverend carelessly, offering his shot glass to his granddaughter. ""I don't know where half of the stuff in this house comes from. You know, you're mother's been dead for seven years and I haven't cooked a proper meal? Not once. Aggie. Taste this."" ""Okay,"" said Agnes, hesitant. ""Daddy, she's pregnant,"" said Minerva. ""You call your father 'Daddy', Professor?"" Christopher raised an eyebrow, fighting to keep a straight face. ""Yes,"" said Minerva testily, challenging him. ""Ryan's going to call you 'Da' until the day you die."" ""It's just a sip."" The reverend cleared his throat and raised his glass, smiling at them.""To a happy marriage."" ""A happy marriage,"" they said, and drank. After the reverend polished off the rest of Agnes's glass, he downed shot after shot with Minerva. Christopher, impressed, gaped at Minerva when she flipped her glass upside down on the table. ""You are so much cooler now we've left school,"" said Christopher. ""Christopher, Christopher."" Minerva walked over to him and took his face in her hand. Agnes giggled like a schoolgirl. ""Your eyes are really blue. I am so glad you're in the family."" ""Me, too,"" said Christopher awkwardly, for she'd held his face at an odd angle. Minerva patted his cheek and straightened. ""I need fresh air."" Elphinstone fought hard not to crack a smile as he followed her outside. She said it was raining, which was obvious, although Elphinstone got halfway down the street before he realized he'd forgotten the umbrella. Thinking he was a drowned rat, anyway, he decided not to go back, though he had no idea where they were headed. He took her hand, surprised she didn't pull away, and turned to the left. ""You're going to get pneumonia."" Minerva brushed her hair out of her eyes. Her dress, splattered and caked with mud, was ruined. She slipped off her heels, carrying them. ""Yet you're the one who walked out into the rain,"" he said, doubting she could see more than a few paces ahead. Slowly, he reached up, slid off her splattered spectacles, and slid them into the inside pocket of his suit jacket. ""So the coffee containers?"" ""It's sad and embarrassing, which is why I never told you."" Minerva blushed. When he grinned, she rolled her eyes, stepping into the light. ""But you're you, Elphinstone, so you probably think it's sweet and adorable."" ""Absolutely adorable."" He left her in no doubt. ""Are you all right?"" Minerva nodded. Before he asked her why the hell she'd decided on a nighttime stroll in this weather, she stopped underneath a lamppost and pecked him with small kisses, insistent. When he started falling, slipping in the large puddle they stood in, she steadied him, switched her heels to one hand, and wrapped her arms around his neck. She pressed her lips against his again. Elphinstone's shoulders relaxed as a car zoomed past in the street. Giving the scotch credit, he stroked her face, wondering how much she'd remember. ""There's a bed in our cottage,"" he murmured between kisses. If his dysfunction continued, he'd see a Healer about it, but until the rain let up he'd give her pleasure, as she'd mentioned, in other ways. The rain continued until Tuesday afternoon."

It's from your sister; it's a belated birthday gift for Shepherd."" Judging by the smeared makeup on her face, she'd cried over this thing. ""It's a birthday card."" ""Read it."" Anne grinned when he tipped a pair of bifocals into his open hand. She started closing the door as Malcolm fished a lighter and a cigarette out of his pocket. ""Yeah, you try not to cry whilst reading that to your son."" Malcolm sat on the front steps, and started to read, taking a long drag from his cigarette. May, 1975 Malcolm weighed his options for the longest time. The way he saw it, after doing extensive research, there were four options on the table. Maybe five. Two of these he had absolutely no idea what to do with, yet they were still in play. On his eleventh birthday, like every other kid in the magical world, Shepherd had received his letter to attend Hogwarts; his sisters went there. Of course, when the school year ended, this would mean pulling him out of deaf school when he had shown only slight signs of magical talent, and this would leave their son in the dark. Even if they could hire a dedicated interpreter, how exactly were they supposed to cover their story? Shepherd needed his hands. If he held a wand day in and day out, he was crippled in his speech. Malcolm couldn't put this in words, but it reminded him of an equivalent of getting kicked in the mouth plenty and often. What fool in their right mind did this to their child? Shepherd could speak, but he chose not to because children had a difficult time understanding him, and he stayed protected within the walls of the Deaf community. He could attend mainstream school, but there again, he'd be the odd man out because an interpreter would hang onto his every word. ""Why not do both?"" Anne placed a brochure for a mainstream public school on top of one for the deaf school. Shepherd had attended the deaf school since primary school. Malcolm, confused, accepted tea from a waiter and dug into his breakfast. ""How?"" Malcolm didn't like that she made this up on the spot, for it was clearly obvious. ""Well, I don't know. No, listen."" Anne flipped the Hogwarts letter facedown because she'd already taken it out of the running. She rolled her eyes when Malcolm frowned, and whispered, ""You want him to fit in. I want him to survive, Malcolm, he can't hear bangs and explosions, and he doesn't talk like them."" ""But he can,""said Malcolm, not entirely buying his defense. ""How? Is there a Deaf magical society?"" Anne glared at him until he gave a noncommittal shrug. She didn't know much about the wizarding world, yet she knew enough to get by. ""If he gets in a fight, he can't speak. The girls know spells. Shepherd can't talk his way out of anything."" ""There are non-verbal spells,"" Malcolm added. ""I talked to your sister, so don't play stupid with me. What's he supposed to do for six years?"" Anne stabbed a potato moodily. ""She doesn't sign. You want to do that to your son? He's not going to that school."" ""But..."" Malcolm dropped it when Anne considered him politely. ""The first student who ties up my boy and points a wand at him loses a limb,"" Anne hissed, seething. She stacked the remaining remaining brochures and went back to her mainstream and deaf school plan. ""He needs to be both, Malcolm, and I know that scares you ..."" ""Well, yeah,"" he said. ""Shep is smart."" ""I know that,"" said Malcolm, feeling like a child. He had a hand in raising the boy. ""But he can't be isolated. He needs maths and science, and his reading level is down,"" said Anne, setting the brochures aside because she'd already made a decision. Last year, they started letting Shepherd stay in the dormitories at Aberdeen. She reached out and squeezed Malcolm's hand, not touching her breakfast. There was nothing wrong with their son, a fact they'd agreed on since he was a small boy. She grinned. Even within English, sign language took different forms. Language and culture gave Malcolm life. ""You know what he told me the other day?"" ""What?"" Malcolm signed to the old, deaf man who wandered into the Cask and Kilt. This man had given his son, Malcolm's son, his sign ages ago. ""Abe got a dog. An Australian shepherd."" Smiling slightly, Anne helped herself to Malcolm's sausage and tomatoes whilst he kept both conversations in play. ""He wants to learn American."" ""Sign language?"" Malcolm put his conversation with his old Deaf friend on pause, showing him he wasn't being snubbed, and turned back to his wife. He considered his upcoming trip to New York this summer, and he'd insisted Shepherd tag along. ""Okay. I don't... where the hell did he get that idea?"" Anne tossed a bit of sausage at him. ""Jumping at the opportunity to go anywhere and everywhere? Who does that sound like? Oh, I don't know."" ""His father. Yeah, Shepherd's mine. The girls?"" Malcolm made her uncomfortable on purpose. Malcolm shrugged, feigning disappointment and picking up with Abe where the two of them had left off. His mother, caring as she was as the minister's wife, gave Anne a lot of grief early on in their marriage. Every time Malcolm came home, Anne either got pregnant or ran around with the little ones. He gasped when Anne threw a handful of eggs and tomatoes in his face. The Deaf man, two tables over, roared with laughter, and Malcolm enjoyed the split, uneven sound. He sat back, wiping the mess off his face, thinking there was magic in Caithness, too."

They can and probably should charge you as an adult, boy. Your mother's at some Muggle hospital getting treatment ... and I can barely make ends meet, But you know everything, Remus Lupin!"" Remus flinched. ""You wanna be an adult? You're an adult!"" Hippocrates nodded at Remus. He hadn't even cleared anything with Lyall at this point, but Lyall didn't care. ""It's not only you. How many times do I have to tell you that, Remus? It's me. It's your parents, Madam Promfrey, Professor Dumbledore ...what about my study? You want be a grown man? Fine! You are volunteering at St. Mungo's this summer. You'll work six days a week and struggle through every second shift till you drop. Congratulations."" ""Hippocrates,"" said Remus, appealing to the Healer as Hippocrates stormed out. His plea fell to deaf ears. Professor Dumbledore let the other boys go, but Remus sat there, stock still. ""I didn't even do anything, Dad,"" ""Maybe you should have, Remus,"" said Lyall. letting go of his anger. He pointed at the closed door. ""That man has kept us off the streets. We get allotments from this case study, do you get that? There are nights I don't eat."" ""Dad,"" said Remus, calling him out for the over exaggeration. ""You don't know!"" Lyall hid everything from Remus, although it was obvious they lived below the poverty line. He, too, got to his feet. Remus got new school robes every year because Lyall not only worked at the Ministry. He worked as a apparition investigator on the side. He took a deep breath, steadying himself. ""You start at the hospital the day after school gets out. Your days off will be the days when the cycle hits. You will find a way to get to and from London. Are we agreed?"" Remus nodded. He left the headmaster's office after he picked up his bag. He didn't look at either his father or Professor Dumbledore. His seventh year, partially due to the fact that Hippocrates worked him to the bone that summer, passed without incident. Remus left school a changed man.,Hippocrates had taught him the wealth behind a hard day's work. On his thirtieth-sixth birthday, Remus lived with his mother-in-law, something he tried no to dwell on, and worked two dead end jobs at a couple Muggle restaurants. Lyall knew he hated one and tolerated the other. At his age, working as both a dishwasher and a server, Remus had committed himself to hard work. Lyall didn't even recognize the kid anymore. His kid had a kid on the way. He'd had to go through Remus's wife, Dora, to track him down. They were at war, so steady work was hard to come by anyway. As Lyall sat at the bar nursing a drink, he listened to stories of how his son kept things going in the kitchen. Remus had always liked to keep his hannds busy, so this compliment came as no surprise to Lyall. Remus jumped stations; he went where he was needed. Remus, leaning on the swinging kitchen door, listened as someone shouted something at him. After wiping his hands on his apron, he picked up two heavy crates for the barmaid. ""Stout and whatever this is,"" said Remus, sliding into the bar as the barmaid handled the first after work wave of patrons. He stocked inventory for her. When he opened the other box, he said, laughing a little, ""and I see why Joel calls this estrogen surge. I get it now. Funny."" ""Funny, old man,"" said the barmaid, flipping glasses onto her polished surface, ""Oh, but it is."" Remus found his server's booklet in his apron and bowed out of her station after he broke down the crates. ""You'll understand that later on tonight, Laura."" ""Hey! Hey, old man, slow down."" The barmaid cupped her hand over her mouth and Remus weaved through tables. Remus stopped, holding his booklet aloft. The barmaid pointed at Lyall. ""He's yours?"" Remus did a double take, taken by surprise. ""I'm his father,"" said Lyall quietly. The barmaid, puzzled, stole a second glance. Remus had aged faster than Lyall, so the two of them could've easily passed as cousins or something. ""He's awesome. New Year's Eve? I left my tips in the till."" The barmaid slapped Remus on the arm as he took a barstool. ""This bloke? Not only made sure I got home, but he made sure I didn't get there empty handed."" ""It was nothing. This is my father, Lyall. Dad, Laura. Oh, yes, I forgot."" Remus took out a roll of bills, unstuck one of them, for it was pay day, Lyall guessed. Remus uncapped one of his pens and wrote a number, a series of numbers, on the bill before he slid it back towards her. ""This is Michael Gallagher. The young man you met last night? He asked me to pass this along. He likes food."" The barmaid laughed. ""Really? That's your pick up line?"" ""Oh, he owed you that,"" said Remus, smiling when she pocketed the money. He started saying something, got caught up in a laugh, and shared it with her. ""I'm married, so I don't have to worry about that anymore. I've never actually done that before."" ""Picked up a girl? You're cute, old man."" The barmaid shook her head and got back to work. When Remus turned back to his father, he counted out his earnings into two equal piles. After this, he pocketed half of it. The Lexington Noir Project, thanks to the anti-werewolf legislation drafted by Delores Umbridge, lost all its funding. Remus took a folded envelope out of his apron, straightened it out again, and stuffed the money inside. They exchanged small talk for a while until his second shift started. Lyall. curious, flipped the envelope over after draining his glass. There were three words on the envelope: Lexington Noir Project ,"

I mean, I didn't know it was going on, but something felt off."" Kingsley put his foot down about this really quick. ""It wasn't your fault."" Lee nodded, no longer on the defensive. ""I hear my mum was this excellent, decorated Auror, you know? I mean, I met Moody in my sixth year, and I couldn't help but felt honored or something that he was going to be my teacher, too."" Kingsley couldn't help himself and corrected him automatically. ""That wasn't Mad-Eye."" ""Yeah. Why couldn't she stop it?"" Lee helped himself to a bottled beer because he was a longtime family friend. Molly had invited her guests, few in the main, to make themselves at home. Lee took the advice to heart. Kingsley guessed Lee had been here before because he knew where stashes were hidden. ""Jordan wiped her memory, Lee, so she didn't know it was happening."" Kingsley could have gone into great detail about this. On the surface, he understood perfectly well why Lee wanted a simple story. He wanted a neatly wrapped present. Perhaps he wanted his parents to get back together. ""Patti had no reason to believe she wasn't happy."" ""Patti."" Lee said his mother's first name like it was a completely foreign concept. Lee placed his hands in his pickets and eventually picked at the scraps of turkey on the large serving platter. Kingsley had once heard this referred to as filing in the corners. ""You really love her?"" ""I do."" Kingsley smiled at him. Although Lee didn't specifically come out and ask why, he, Kingsley, elaborated a little. Husbands and wives told their significant others they loved each other every day. He might still be in the blissful honeymoon stage, yet he had a list. ""She talks in her sleep whenever she's worried about a charge. She snores and wakes herself up. We're both Catholics who attack the faith with dark humor."" Lee knit his eyebrows together. ""I don't follow the Church."" ""Okay."" Kingsley shrugged this off. He'd questioned his faith at Lee's age, too, and it was Lee's decision on whether or not he wanted to return to the faith. Kingsley fingered the Christian cross around his neck. He'd received it from his godfather, his uncle, on his confirmation. Kingsley unhooked the clasp and felt the chain of the necklace slip through his fingers. He played with it and studied the wedding band on his left hand. ""I have to sell this to get pain relief for your mother."" Lee came up with an easier answer. ""You're wealthy. You buy expensive Muggle suits. I bet you have loads stashed away in a Gringott's vault."" ""Gold can be tracked."" Kingsley rather liked that the kid had a good head on his shoulders. He held the necklace to the candlelight. ""This ought to be enough for decent generic solutions. And the name you wanted. Prudence Edgecombe. She's a good, fair counsellor who will hear you out. I'll pay her legal fees."" ""You'd just give that away?"" Lee shifted as Kingsley conjured a container of jewelry cleaner and erased years of damage. ""I'm not of the flock of the faithful or whatever, but I know that's no mere trinket for you."" ""It's jewelry,"" said Kingsley, taking out his earring and cleaning it, too, though he replaced it in his ear. He wasn't a philosophical man, despite the fact that he was a faithful one. He replaced the lid on the cleaner and tucked it away into a drawer. ""There will be times in your life when you have things, and there will be other times when you literally feel you have nothing."" Lee stopped him there. ""Mum told you that."" ""Yes."" Kingsley smiled at him, pleased he'd picked up on the saying so quickly. He walked over to the kitchen door, stopping Molly before she came in from the dining room. ""Wait a moment, please."" Molly backed out without saying a word. Lee went back to the legal reference; Kingsley dropped a powerful name and offered to foot the bill without hesitation. ""Are you serous? Thank... thank you."" Kingsley shrugged his shoulders. ""You're family. You're my stepson. Consider it a Christmas gift."" Kingsley found Patti's chocolate mousse and light chocolate cake. He pocketed his cross, thinking he'd start with a high bid. He hated that Nott supposedly recorded a record of pureblood families. Kingsley's name was on that list; it might work to his advantage for once and place weight behind his name. When he carried the dessert into the dining room, Lee carried the serving bowls. Kingsley wished to go to the black market alone, although he'd make it back in time for evening Mass. Before he sat down, he heard Arthur Weasley compliment Patti on the cake. Smiling, Kingsley wondered what Fleur would have thought about this take on an authentic French recipe. Molly pursed her lips, apparently thinking along the same lines, although she took a second slice. Patti possessed a handful of talents. She understood food. Kingsley was somewhat of a health nut. He called off all bets when it came to this dessert because it was his favorite. It went well with a cup of coffee. Kingsley realized, a little too late, he'd forgotten the brew. ""I love this thing,"" he said, savoring the last bite. He didn't turn Patti's half-eaten dessert down when she pushed her plate towards him. ""I know."" Patti laughed when he actually licked his fork. When he leaned into her, she smiled, kissing him. She said something in flawless Parisian French that Kingsley didn't understand a word of her nonsense, but Arthur asked Patti to speak with his daughter-in-law. She paused, blushing a little as she got comfortable around the family. Lee snorted into his half-empty wine glass. Patti, unabashed, kissed her husband passionately this time. She landed on a sumple translation. "" I love you, too."""
84,0,13,0-LunaStellaCat-13.txt,harry-potter,LunaStellaCat,"Yes, I'm glad you've finally decided to see the light."" Hippocrates stopped dead. He'd been about to ask if she'd heard from Remus Lupin, and why she had bothered coming back to the hospital at this late hour. Both questions died on his lips as he stared at Fenrir Greyback. He'd never met the man before, though he knew him by reputation. Frightened, scared out of his mind, Hippocrates held Maisie closer. ""What is he doing here?"" ""Don't panic, Hippocrates."" Abbey placed a hand on Greyback's shoulder as she approached him. Greyback nodded, letting her lift his robes and reveal the exposed bone in his leg. ""Remember we help anyone. We are neutral. Switzerland."" Sw itzerland would eradicate a monster , he thought dully. They didn't take sides. Hippocrates himself had warned her of this when she'd joined the hospital staff years ago, and he felt rather insulted having his advice thrown back in his face. He wasn't going to allow this man onto his ward. He patted Maisie's head, not wanting her to make eye contact with the werewolf. ""Do it."" Hippocrates stood up straighter. ""He doesn't like me, this one,"" sneered Greyback, addressing Abbey, who knelt down awkwardly to access the damage. Abbey said nothing. She mended the leg in no time after setting it. Greyback offered her a dirty hand when she'd finished her task. Abbey took it, hesitating. ""It's been a while since we've last met."" ""I remember,"" she said tonelessly. She groaned when he pulled her close and held a blade to her throat. ""What're you doing?"" ""You're a problem, Abigail,"" he said, his tone gravelly and controlled. He smiled at Hippocrates, his sharp teeth showing. He shook his head at Hippocrates. ""Do not raise your wand, sir. Your wife keeps getting in my way, giving werewolves false hope, making them think they don't need to join with their kind, so we're having a chat."" ""A chat? You are harming her!"" Hippocrates gripped his wand in his hand. He chose to rely on an old rule; violence wasn't allowed in this place. No security wizards guarded this place. He backed away, showing his open hand before he placed it on Maisie's back again. He dropped his wand onto the floor. ""Sanctuary. This place is a sanctuary."" Abbey kept her gaze fixed on Greyback. ""Please."" ""Mummy. I want Mummy."" Maisie turned her head, reaching out to Abbey. ""I wanna go home."" ""Hey, Healer Smethwyck, the night wasn't that bad,"" said Jaime, running up to give his report. He took in the scene. ""What the hell is going on here?"" ""Jaime, I want you to take my daughter,"" said Hippocrates, forcing himself to stay calm and collected. He argued with Maisie, who panicked, not understanding what was going on. ""Maisie, I will be right with you. Maisie, please. Jaime, I need you to walk ... do not run ... to the matron station. Tell them we are on High Alert, and this is not a drill. Contact the authorities at the Ministry. You got that?"" ""Yes."" Jaime didn't hesitate. Hippocrates nodded, silently praying for the first time in years and kissing Maisie on the cheek. He didn't know if there was a higher power. ""Jaime, take this child from me. Now!"" ""Yes, sir."" Jaime scooped up Maisie and darted down the corridor. ""She treated you. You ... you may leave."" Hippocrates kept his eyes on the werewolf. He shook with fear, desperate. ""Good God, it's Christmastime!"" Greyback lowered his blade. He held Abbey close, resting a hand on her stomach and whispering in her ear. A moment later, he shoved her toward Hippocrates and escaped through the emergency exit door. Hippocrates was too thankful that his wife lived to think about giving chase. Let the Aurors deal with Greyback. He rushed to Abbey and held her close. Abbey gasped. ""My water just broke!"" He lifted her into his arms and strode from the ward. The maternity ward staff held at bay the Aurors who had wanted to interview them in the labor room. Hippocrates wanted to ask Abbey questions, too, but she was dilating so quickly he decided it was more important to encourage her through the contractions that were coming closer and closer together. Abbey had other ideas. After a particularly hard contraction, she said through gritted teeth, ""Fenrir Greyback will not keep me from helping patients!"" Hippocrates took her hand and gave it a gentle squeeze. ""He'll be officially banned from St. Mungo's."" Her fingers clenched his. ""We'll have to be vigilant. Practice defensive spells, beef up security wards and hire a bodyguard for the children. Mother will pay for it. She'll want to boast to her social set that a monster is stalking her poor grandchildren."" ""What?"" Surely he hadn't heard her right. A monster stalking their children? Abbey saved her breath to get through the next contraction. When the pain eased, she said, ""He told me to stay away from his brethren or he'd add my children to their numbers. My girls. Our girls."" Her eyes blazed with fury. ""He likes kids."" The memory of Greyback pulling Abbey close and whispering in her ear caused Hippocrates to wish he hadn't taken a vow to do no harm. ""The bastard will never touch them."" Abbey's eyes welled with tears. Did she doubt him? His question was answered by her wobbly smile. ""Most men would tell me to think of the children and let the werewolves take care of themselves. I love you, Hippocrates Smethwyck."" ""I love you, Short Stuff."" ""Ahem. I hate to interrupt,"" the OBGYN Healer said as he walked in, followed by the labor and delivery mediwitch. ""But I'm told your baby wants to be born."" Abbey nodded vigorously. ""I feel the urge to push."" Hippocrates watched the miracle of birth, and for some crazed reason found himself humming God Rest Ye Merry Hippogriffs. ""Let nothing you dismay,"" Abbey whispered as she cradled their daughter, tiny and naked, in her loving arms."

Jaime, no, you're not!"" Charlie argued with his man half-heartedly as the Potters and Weasleys turned to enjoy this Charlie as babysitter spectacle. The Brazilians insulted him, and even though he didn't understand, Charlie got the gist of it. Charlie asked for a Butterbeer and thanked Harry. He handed it to Jaime. ""Carry on, mate."" ""Poor Jaime,"" said Luna, snuggling closer to Rolf. ""Poor Jaime? He's drunk. That's all that is."" Rolf patted her arm and sighed when she predicted a Bulgaria win. ""You think so?"" ""Yeah."" Luna snorted when Harry shouted that he had fifty Galleons on Bulgaria and Krum grabbing the Snitch. ""Let's play! One hundred Galleons says Harry's wrong and Silva grabs the Snitch right from underneath Krum's nose!"" roared Charlie. ""I'll take that action!"" Rolf raised his hand and slapped skin with Charlie again. Bill, leaning over his daughter and her eager boyfriend, gave them a double thumbs-up. Luna muttered that they were idiots. Rolf nudged her, saying it was all in good fun. Rolf winced when Viktor Krum got beat with the Beater's bat. He clapped when Krum signaled he was all right to continue playing. He frowned, for he'd not expected the once retired Bulgarian Seeker to be made of stronger stuff. Rolf regretted his choice. ""That's my pocket money gone. Yep. Stupid move, Rolf."" ""You don't say?"" Luna, amused, shook her head when he asked her to front him half as Krum snatched the Snitch. All sides of the stadium rose collectively to their feet and cheered him on. ""No, no, sir."" As people started to leave the match, Rolf and Charlie went to surrender their gold over to Harry. Harry accepted their defeat with a huge grin. Rolf turned out his pockets, for he came up a little short, took his money back, and offered him a capsule of frozen Ashwinder eggs instead. ""Take these and rob Scamander. Rob him blind,"" suggested Charlie. Harry took the Ashwinder eggs and stowed them in his robes. ""Keep them frozen. The Freezing Charm needs to be recast every three months. It's July, so that's October."" Rolf got shooed away by Charlie. Rolf went to go survey the damage the Dukuwaga and the Selma had caused during their bloodbath in the opening ceremony. Charlie said nobody wanted to hear his magi-zoology nonsense. Rolf had been angry that this careless oversight had taken place, but nobody listened. ""They didn't even have a magi-zoologist on site. Nor did they consult anyone, Luna!"" Rolf grumbled as she steered him away, saying consolingly that the damage had been done. ""Yeah, but … that's awful."" ""Write about it, Mr. Scamander,"" she said gently, heading back the stands to grab her forgotten handbag. The Brazilians, defeated and shocked, finally decided to come down out of the box with Charlie Weasley. ""Not that anyone will read it,"" said Rita Skeeter scathingly as she snapped her crocodile bag shut. Jorge and Jaime, slightly sobered now, surveyed her. Rita spoke to them like they were slow. As she'd already suffered for her cheek in the commentator's box already, Rolf waited patiently for her to make another move; it was inevitable because she never knew when to shut up. Luna allowed both of the Brazilians to take her by the arm and walked downstairs with them. ""When are you committing your deranged children into St. Mungo's? Your grandfather was right to implement breeding restrictions at the Ministry of Magic. Funny. I thought you lived by old Newt."" Rita hissed quietly as she made to pass Rolf; she'd gotten insulted and chosen him as a weak link. Ginny, shocked, asked her to say that a bit louder. ""Oh, he heard me."" ""They're three, Rita,"" said Rolf. ""Come on. Pick someone else."" ""Your family should've been silenced by that Death Potion back in 1926."" She giggled, looking for an ally where there was none. ""Especially you and your grandfather. It's quick and painless, I hear. Problem solved."" Rolf stood rooted to the spot. Next moment, Rita's body was lifted off the ground. She crumpled at the foot of the staircases and Rolf looked around, lost, for he'd missed something. Luna, Ginny, Jorge, Jaime and Charlie all had their wands outstretched. Jorge and Jaime both swore violently. Luna, smiling serenely at Rita's paralyzed body, walked on and started humming to herself as she headed down with the boys again. Rolf relaxed, amused by her. Luna was Luna. If this rubbed people the wrong way, that was their problem, and he wasn't going to apologize for his family. Ginny told Rolf's lot they were awesome before she hugged her elder brother and Disapparated. Charlie gave a cry of a Chinese Fireball and broke Rolf's dazed expression. ""You coming or what, Scamander? We're continuing this party in Dorset. I want a word with Newt Scamander."" Anything involving Newt interested Rolf. ""Oh? About what?"" Rolf quickened his step and went to follow his friends. He wanted in on this story. Luna, laughing again, draped her arms around Jaime's and Jorge's necks. Rolf caught up with Charlie. They walked around aimlessly for about an hour reminiscing about Romania and the good olde days. Charlie, unable to help himself, said he wanted Rolf by his side next year. ""Scamander and Weasley back together again."" Charlie pointed out a winged camel in the distance. Luna Disapparated with their houseguests. Charlie hesitated before they Disapparated, though he lost his concentration when Rolf jokingly said he couldn't support a friendship that hadn't been taken officially to the next step. He had two kids with another one on the way and a wife. He had no time for this budding bromance nonsense. Charlie gave a false, girly laugh reminiscent of Rolf's great aunt. ""Oh, Scamander, you slay me."" Rolf conjured Dorset to mind and pictured his grandfather's friendly, wrinkled face. They vanished from the Patagonian Desert."

He got through the first press conference sweating bullets and allowed Penelope to take over after a short statement. ""I froze,"" he said, stepping off to the side. ""You were fine,"" said Patti, straightening his tie. When that failed, she took the thing off, cast a Color Changing Charm, switching to blue, and put it back on him and added a pin to his lapel. ""Cue cards save lives, eh?"" ""Yeah,"" said Kingsley, surrendering the prized index cards written in his wife's hand. ""You know what I always say. You're caught in a tight corner? Get Patti Strauss on it."" ""Or, you know, marry her,"" she said, smiling slightly, shaking when he pulled her back onto the stage. They held hands and raised their linked hands together. The photograph opportunity too more than a minute, and Penelope slipped into character. Patti rubbed his shoulders. ""Downing Street? Round two."" Kingsley nodded, glad he wasn't alone. He needed to clear this up because the press secretary's first mistake ruined everything. ""Patti? The leak? It's not Miss Clearwater's fault."" ""I know."" Patti continued prepping him for Downing Street. Later that afternoon, after their meeting on Downing Street and the funeral, Kingsley spent about an hour in the rain cruising for street food with Patti. Neither of they had eaten all day, so they were running on fumes and starving. A world traveler, she liked for the local food market. The fresh stuff came out in the morning, and they'd clearly missed this with their slammed schedule. She kept offering him food as they jumped from station to station in London. ""Japanese taco,"" she said, careful with the paper wrappings, pouring soy sauce into a lettuce wrap. The vendor handed her some cheap wasabi. Kingsley said he'd never had fresh tuna or wasabi, and Patti, grinning offered him an experience. She liked frequenting sushi bars in New York, although he didn't prefer raw fish. ""Try this."" Kingsley shook his head. ""One bite."" She got one with imitation crabmeat, too, though she kept her hands on this one. As they left the market, Kingsley tried the one with tuna, merely to please her, and devoured the whole thing. She nodded, satisfied she'd won this argument. ""I keep telling you there's food out there whilst you're hiding out on your little island."" ""There are sushi bars here,"" he said, frowning at her. ""That's not authentic Japanese food,"" she said, shaking her head and wiping her mouth with a napkin. Patti took holidays whenever she got the time. With no family and a demanding career, she basically stuck a red pin into a map at random and took off. They split the one with crabmeat, and Kingsley, ignoring Patti's giggles, went back for another. ""It's good, right? Oooh, you want some gelato?"" ""You're going to mess up your stomach,"" he warned her. As it was the weekend, they were off, and the real work didn't start until the following Monday. They'd fled into Muggle London, abandoning Penelope, a woman who tailed them like a faithful dog. Patti was a foodie, and he knew this, so there was no telling her no to eat something. They were running low on pocket money. ""This isn't much of a honeymoon."" ""Are you kidding me? Food. Two of those, please,"" asked Patti, handing over the rest of her change to a vendor. The vendor chuckled when she tossed a few food wrappers out of her handbag. Patti clapped her hands like a little girl when the vendor added a drizzle of Nutella to hers. ""Is that the real stuff?"" Kingsley, allergic to hazelnuts and almonds, declined. He'd never had any. ""There are different types?"" ""Ah, poor London boy,"" sighed Patti, taking a plastic spoon from the vendor and taking a taste. ""That's it. That's like a drug. Thanks. Yes, Kingsley, there are different versions of absolutely everything. Tomatoes and rice. Spaghetti. Cheese grits. Salads."" ""Cheese grits? When did you turn American?"" He looped his arm through hers, enjoying his ice cream. When she looked away, he led her towards the Leaky Cauldron. When she turned back to face him, talking about some senator or official, Kingsley dabbed her nose in the ice cream before tossing it in a nearby bin. Her expression was priceless, for it took a minute to get it. They went right past the pub. ""Yeah, I want the other Patti back, please and thank you."" ""Oh, my God."" Patti dropped her cone in the street. It worked out better than he'd expected, really, for she smeared the stuff all over her face. Kingsley, laughing, took out a handkerchief and wiped the mess away. When he led her into Diagon Alley, Kingsley stopped outside the Magical Menagerie. ""What're you doing?"" ""A long time ago, you asked me for something."" He handed over the umbrella and stepped into the shop. Kingsley worked quickly, for the proprietor, recognizing him as the new Minister, ate up time. He tried to for politeness because he'd left his wife outside in the downpour. When he came back, he showed her the black half -kneazle in the pet carrier and the litter box. ""This is Grits."" He wanted no other grits in his home. ""This is my wedding present?"" asked Patti. Patti laughed so hard she wiped away actual tears from her eyes. She didn't take it out of the pet carrier. It had cost him ten Galleons, so Kingsley walked home broke, too. When they got home, Patti promised to have a private one-on-one with Senator Jackson, who they both guessed leaked the first secret to the papers. About an hour later, Patti went off to grab groceries with the house-elf. The place, thanks to the house-elf, looked and smelled better. Tired, Kingsley dumped the half-kneazle in the sitting room; it immediately darted for the space under the coffee table, and then Kingsley passed out on the couch. This is was the first day."
87,0,40,0-LunaStellaCat-40.txt,harry-potter,LunaStellaCat,"too bright, is he? Nina raised those children. Well, there's your matron up at the school."" Elphinstone placed a finger underneath her chin and slowly turned her head to face him. He spoke slowly and confidently. ""You have nothing to worry about, love, because I'm going nowhere."" And then he kissed her. ""Minerva?"" a deep voice said at the top of the stairs. ""You're early."" ""Daddy."" Minerva practically jumped to her feet as she straightened out her dress. She got to her feet and patted her hair. The reverend stood there with a cardboard box full of contents. He wore a plain dress shirt over ironed slacks. He looked Elphinstone up and down. The Reverend McGonagall resembled his daughter, especially in the face, although his dark hair was sprinkled with grey. Elphinstone, who had never bothered with meeting the parents before, got to his feet. He introduced himself as Minerva's friend. ""Come inside."" The reverend led them inside the church. They stood in the aisle and he drafted his piece, a sermon, Elphinstone thought, at the pulpit. Every once in a while, he'd scratch his chin or say the words out loud, lost in his work. Monday was a dead day at the church. Minerva, nervous, patted Elphinstone's arm. Whenever the reverend looked up, she dashed off. Elphinstone didn't have anything to say, so he stood there with a smile on his face. ""What do you do?"" The reverend flipped through a Bible. ""I'm a lawyer,"" said Elphinstone, shifting his weight, and added, as always for clarification, ""an estates lawyer."" ""They have regular specialities in the wizarding world. Imagine that."" The reverend returned to his work. ""Your name sounds familiar."" Elphinstone nodded, struggling to think of where the Reverend McGonagall might've heard of him. This definitely would not warm the stern man up to him, but he went with the truth. ""I was her boss for three years at the Ministry."" Minerva returned and walked up the steps to the pulpit. He kissed her father on the cheek. ""Daddy. What're you talking about?"" ""Mr. Urquart says he's your friend, an estates lawyer,"" he said, filling her in. He raised his eyebrows and set his work aside. ""It's nice that he cares for you."" ""Yes,"" said Elphinstone, catching the edge in the man's voice. ""Though why he would be kissing my daughter at church, I have not a clue."" He glanced at Minerva, who paled. If anyone else would've challenged her, Minerva would've shut it down. ""You look ill, Minerva."" ""I'm fine,"" she said, wiping her face with a handkerchief. She glanced at Elphinstone and shifted the handbag on her shoulder. ""It's a bug."" ""One of those twenty-four spells?"" The reverend took her by the hand, spotting the sapphires like a target. ""You're getting married?"" Elphinstone nodded. ""To him? Who are you?"" The reverend demanded, leading his daughter down the steps and glaring at Elphinstone. His momentary pride evaporated in an instant. He raised his voice when Minerva started speaking, drowning her out. ""She is my only daughter. She is my joy in life. Why would you want to marry her?"" ""Daddy, this is my decision, and I am not a child."" Minerva took her arm back, her confidence leaked though her tone. ""Quiet! I don't want to hear another word from you,"" he said, turning back to Elphinstone. ""You don't even know her!"" ""I know her."" Elphinstone remained calm, looking into his eyes. He didn't fear many people. ""I know she sleeps on her left side, I know she leaves the cap off the toothpaste, and I know she washes her hair with rosemary and mint shampoo."" Minerva raised her eyebrows in surprise, but she turned back to her father. Smiling to himself, Elphinstone surged with pride that he'd gotten that last one right. ""She's confident, and she's so intelligent it's almost scary. I can go on all day, sir."" Elphinstone argued with people for a living, and he was quite good at his job whenever he got in his element. ""I love her. I'm going to marry her because she's ...she's everything. There aren't many out there like her."" The reverend straightened, mildly interested. Elphinstone had tried not to fall for this woman. ""Trust me, sir, I've looked. Your daughter is special."" ""I like him. You should bring him around more often,"" said the reverend, speaking to his daughter. ""Let's do tea at three, and we'll have dinner, too. I can make Shepard's pie. Keep this one."" ""All right, three o'clock,"" she said, taking Elphinstone out of the church. She tucked her arm in his, returning to her brisk manner. She ran her finger engagement ring, hesitating a little. ""There's no baby."" Elphinstone sighed, taken aback by his disappointment. ""You're sure?"" Minerva slipped a small book, a calendar, book into her handbag. Elphinstone knew what it was because his mother used to carry one of those. Relieved, she added, ""Positive. I'm feeling a little under the weather. That's all."" ""But you're sure?"" She offered him the ring back. ""Not altogether, no. Wait and see."" ""I wasn't marrying you for a child,"" he said, slipping it back on her hand and kissing it. ""I know you're not ready, but that will change one day, so you keep it. It's yours. I'm yours."" ""But..."" Her voice trailed off. ""Are you suddenly not going to be engaged over dinner?"" Elphinstone squeezed her hand. ""I don't know about you, but I'd rather not anger the reverend right after. I stole his daughter."" ""What do you want?"" ""I want you."" He wanted to sit at table and enjoy Shepard's pie. He placed a hand on her waist as they walked off, for he'd never seen Caithness properly. Today she'd show him around like a local. ""I left the Three Broomsticks for Shepard's pie?"" ""A dry Shepard's pie, most likely."" Minerva pecked him on the cheek as she steered him towards the town square. ""You know my shampoo? Impressive."" Elphinstone grinned. He loved her shampoo."
88,0,37,0-LunaStellaCat-37.txt,harry-potter,LunaStellaCat,"slipping away from him. He wanted death. It had been the longest two weeks of his life, which certainly said something because he used to work eight hours at the Ministry of Magic regularly. As he laid in bed thinking about his life, he wondered why much of it really mattered. Amelia Bones. He'd handcrafted that woman out of nothing, literally nothing, for the Ministry of Magic. Benjamin Fenwick had been his, too, his right hand man (or his lefthand man, for this was Elphinstone's dominant hand), though he was dead now. The two of them, Amelia and Benji, had married. In his life, his personal life, things dwindled down to his best mate and his family and Elphinstone's life and her family. No regrets. Other than the part where he and Mitchel Burke had lost seven years over some woman, Mitchel's first wife, he held no regrets here. When it came to Minerva? Elphinstone chose not to dwell on this. In the end, he'd gotten what he wanted. He slept at least half his life away nowadays because he got to escape the pain, and it make life easier. He woke up laughing in the middle of the night. Surprised he wasn't sleeping alone in the single bed, Elphinstone pulled his wife closer and breathed in her rosemary and lemon scented shampoo. Minerva's hair fell damp, though she'd changed into robes after taking a shower. ""What is it?"" she asked, her eyes still closed. ""Oh, nothing. Thinking about Mitchel, I suppose. "" He glanced at the lantern on the bedside table, wondering why she always kept the lights on. Thinking there was no time better than the present, he leaned on his good side, running his fingers through her hair. ""I'm pretty sure this is against hospital policy. You're breaking the rules, Professor."" ""I don't care,"" she said, turning to face him. ""The chair is uncomfortable. And I couldn't sleep."" ""Why not?"" Elphinstone knew why. If they didn't knock him out with three different sleeping potions, including the Lotus Leaf, he'd probably never fall asleep. They force-fed him everything, and he refused to eat unless he was hungry. He'd lost thirty pounds in a short period of time. On the plus side, the Healers had thrown most of the rules out of window, so he could eat whatever he wished when he got a hankering. He'd barely touched food today. ""Maisie came up an idea to get you to eat,"" she said, lighting the lantern on the other bedside table. ""Calling her Maisie now, are we?"" He smiled. ""I knew you liked her. No. I'm not smoking again. I can't believe you'd agree to that."" ""I don't care. If it eases your pain, I don't care anymore. It's not a cigarette."" ""Minerva."" He chuckled, brushing her hair out of her face and kissing her. ""I grew up much less sheltered than you. I grew up with Mitchel, all right? Give a man some credit, okay? I know."" ""Oh. You never told me that."" Elphinstone relaxed a little, trying to make this as comfortable as possible for her, though he'd never thought of her as the pious reverend's daughter. He knew, he simply knew where this conversation was headed. The substance was an illegal one. Mitchel would go through lengths to not see his friend, his brother, in pain. They'd known each other since they were small boys. Elphinstone knew this was why Mitchel hadn't visited him in hospital; he couldn't watch Elphinstone die. Minerva had visited the Three Broomsticks last night, and as the barman, Mitchel got his hands on this stuff. ""He gave you some?"" Elphinstone shook his head, laughing before she even answered him. He would've paid money, good money, to see that awkward exchange. He held out his hand. ""Give it here."" ""Are you sure?"" she asked. ""You want me to have an appetite?"" Minerva found a bag in her handbag and handed it over before she went to open the window. She handed him a lighter. ""I can't believe a matron suggested this."" ""I can."" He lit up, took a drag, and closed his eyes. What did it truly matter at this point? He hadn't smoked anything in nearly twenty years, and he'd missed it without knowing it because it stayed dormant in the back of his mind. She wouldn't want to discuss this, especially not in the middle of the night, but Elphinstone needed her to hear he had set his affairs in order. ""Minerva."" ""No."" She recognized his businesslike tone. But he was running out of time. As an estate lawyer, the last thing he was his possessions contested in probate court. Not that he'd care, really, because he'd be in the ground. He worried about her. ""My lawyer is Jonathan Harkin."" She knew this already. But Minerva nodded. ""Everything's yours."" ""Except whatever you've gifted,"" she said. ""You're leaving Rosmerta your shares to the Three Broomsticks? She's Mitchel's granddaughter."" ""And one hundred and fifty-thousand Galleons to cover expenses."" ""Elphinstone, she's nineteen."" Minerva raised her eyebrows, surprised. She chose not to argue with him when he shrugged it off like it was nothing. She moved onto her nieces and nephews. ""Do I even want to know what you've left the kids?"" ""Not really."" He smiled, wrapping the contraband and handing it back to her. ""Amelia gets a fourth of the estate. Though her children can't touch anything until they're thirty."" ""That's generous of you,"" she said fairly, climbing back in the bed. Elphinstone understood this was the end of the estate discussion. When he started kissing her neck, she closed her eyes and enjoyed his touch. ""You're tired, Elphinstone, I can tell by your voice."" ""I'm exhausted,"" he admitted, exhaling deeply and resting his head on her shoulder. He nodded off for the first time without slipping into an induced coma in days, and she stayed by his side for the next few nights. On the seventeenth day, Elphinstone simply drifted off to sleep."
89,0,32,0-LunaStellaCat-32.txt,harry-potter,LunaStellaCat,"Dumbledore actually bothered with saying farewell. They walked off together. Frank and Alice, not long for this world, for they were both dead on their feet, followed in their wake. Playing a married couple was actually difficult when you were already married to your significant other. Frank found this out really quickly. They didn't have to shed their closeness, but Frank and Alice could no longer be Frank and Alice. He lived for the small things. If the Death Eaters knew all of their quirks, they would basically be themselves masquerading in finer clothes. This would kill them. Alice, left-handed, had trained herself to be ambidextrous, for in her mind, Maggie's dominant hand was the right one. She'd used a Color Changing Charm to change her hair to rich, brunette locks. After work, they changed into these people and left their true selves behind. They changed house, which was a headache in itself, yet they weren't strapped with two mortgage payments. The Ministry paid for everything. In late May, Frank returned to this house to find the second bedroom transformed into a nursery. Alice, who came home early more because Mad-Eye insisted the neighbors needed to see her out and about, showed him the lacy bassinet. The walls were pink. When he got home, she whispered seductively in his ear, and before he knew his next move, they made love on the nursery floor. Alice laughed when Frank asked what was for dinner. ""Was that Maggie or you?"" Frank zipped his trousers and buttoned his shirt. They masqueraded as Muggles. ""I'm good either way. No complaints."" Alice rolled her eyes and laid on the thick comforter. ""So, are you shooting for subtlety here, or does this mean we're having a girl?"" Frank nodded when Alice said she had nothing to do with decorating this place. She didn't want to know the gender. ""Ah, well, that's a potential problem."" ""Why?"" Alice searched for her clothes and got dressed. As she got bigger, it was more comfortable to don Muggle clothes. ""What happens if Maggie's and Zeek's daughter comes out sporting an extra appendage?"" Frank raised his eyebrows when Alice's round face fell in a comical expression. He helped her to her feet. ""Uh huh. Suddenly Betsy's not Betsy."" ""Betsy? That's awful."" Alice frowned at him and watched him make pre-packaged macaroni cheese. Frank showed her the two wrapped parcels and admitted he was lost. He understood the pasta part, though the other white parcel threw him for a loop. ""It's powdered cheese. You mix it in."" Frank shrugged and handed her the stuff. ""You read the box, Zeek,"" she said, adding the powdered processed cheese in with a touch of milk. She served up pork chops, canned corn, and macaroni cheese. After Lily had explained the mystery of the can opener, Alice had become rather adept with using the Muggle contraption. They sat at the small dining room table. ""You think they're watching us?"" ""What? In the nursery?"" Frank frowned, for it hadn't crossed his mind. Bugging was a Muggle tactic, not a magical one. He sounded unsure. ""No? I hope not."" Alice tucked a loose strand of hair behind her ear. ""Someone needs to stop spending time with Alastor Moody."" Since she'd planted the idea in his head, Frank got stuck, and the previous scene played through his mind. Alice, amused, watched the shock wash over his face. He lost his appetite. ""Wait. When did this occur to you?"" ""Wouldn't you like to know?"" Alice waited for him to pick up his fork again. ""Don't tease me, Maggie, I don't like it."" Frank got to invent Zeek from scratch, which he liked, and Alice got to do the same with her cover. He started eating again. It was nice of the Auror Office to give them complete freedom. He thought of another puzzle. ""Does this mean we have to come up with two names?"" ""For?"" Alice got the point when Frank waved at her with his fork. She rested her hand briefly on her belly. ""Oh, I didn't think of that. You think so?"" ""I don't see this lifting before the end of summer, do you?"" The process moved slowly as they tracked the movements of Augustus Rookwood. Alice shook her head. If they sped things up, they risked exposing themselves and blowing the entire operation. ""So, what're we calling her? The crazy cat lady across the street wants to throw you a baby shower."" ""No. That's mental."" Alice asked for seconds. Frank got up to get her some, and they went back to discussing names. ""Charlotte."" ""Lottie Longbottom?"" Frank played Devil's advocate and tossed this back in her face. Alice scratched this out on a nearby notepad. Frank gave it a go. ""Regina."" ""I'm not even going to dignify that with a response. Besides the crazy cat knows us as Todd. Charlotte Todd works."" Alice jotted it down and promptly crossed it out. ""I'm still thinking. You go."" Frank racked his brains and snapped his fingers. ""Joshua."" ""Joshua,"" said Alice approvingly, saying the name aloud and consulting their long list. This thing had been drafted over days. The way this went, if he mentioned a boy's name, she matched him with another one. She said nothing for minutes. Frank, thinking they were done with the game for the day, started doing the dishes by hand. He didn't catch it the first time. ""Neville Joshua."" ""What? No."" Frank dipped his hands into the soapy water. When she said nothing, he turned and saw pure content on her face. ""Alice! Alice, no. Neville? A kid called Neville gets beat up and picked on."" ""Shut up, Francis,"" she said, still smiling. ""Yeah! You know my name? Francis Dominic? I learned to run fast. So many jokes. Not funny jokes."" Frank finished cleaning the kitchen and cursed his mother for branding him with this atrocity. ""Seriously? Alice."" It wasn't happening. There was no way in hell Frank was calling his child Neville Longbottom."
90,0,35,0-LunaStellaCat-35.txt,harry-potter,LunaStellaCat,"Patti stopped. ""Just tell me,"" he said, seeing the fear etched on her face. He expected to hear about a boyfriend or a one night stand. They'd been engaged the first time round for a few months. ""It's fine."" ""I met a senator. This man."" She tapped on the newspaper. ""And he asked me to help him over to the hotel. He was drunk, I expect ..."" Kingsley held up his hand, finished his apple, and tossed the core into the wastebasket. He didn't like where this was headed, and he didn't want to know. Patti, a wealthy woman, fit in well with the high class society, which is why the United States government, MACUSA, probably picked her for this assignment. ""I don't want to know,"" he said, checking the fruit bowl. ""No, Kingsley, if I don't tell you ... "" Patti caught her breath, casting a terrified look at the door. She held his face in her hands, and they were trembling. In her excitement, she knocked the bagel onto the tiled floor. ""You'll marry me no matter what?"" ""No."" He gave her an honest answer; Kingsley turned his head and tapped the newspaper. The man sought re-election in MACUSA. He read off the name in the caption. ""Barney Grimsditch."" ""I'm only going to say this once."" Her skin turned green. ""Okay,"" said Kingsley, getting bored, and frankly, wondering if she'd admit anything at all at this point. He checked his watch. People stood outside waiting to grab a quick bite to eat during the last minutes of lunch. ""Patricia."" Patti picked her bagel off the floor and tossed it in the wastebasket. ""That man ... he raped me."" Kingsley stared at her, speechless. He sank into a chair at the island in the middle of the kitchen. Patti left, opening the kitchen door, apologizing to the waiting queue outside, and disappeared into a bustling crowd as someone shouted about some story concerning the Royal Family. Nausea washed over him. When someone offered him a glass of water and some pills, he took them in one swallow, not even caring what they were. They took effect some fifteen minutes later. Kingsley didn't know what to do. Later that evening, he'd arrived home alone. Technically, she didn't live here; he lived as a bachelor in his expensive flat. Patricia had a toothbrush in his toothbrush holder and her makeup bag was under the sink. He'd planned on buying her a dressing gown, yet it kept slipping his mind for some reason. He searched the entire place, although she definitely wasn't there. Hours later, he woke to the sound of running water and walked into the bathroom. After closing the lid, he sat on the toilet. ""Patti?"" ""Yeah?"" Her silhouette was clouded by the frosted door. She raised her voice so he could hear her over the rushing water. Steam filled the room. She opened the door a little and stuck out her hand; the engagement ring glittered there. ""I need the shampoo from the linen cupboard, please."" Kingsley grabbed the lavender scented stuff for her. As she had moved her stuff into his linen cupboard, he read this as a good sign. He gave her the shampoo. When she stepped out of the shower, Patti pulled on Kingsley's dressing gown over his Puddlemere United t-shirt she'd ""borrowed"" as a nightshirt. As she brushed her teeth, Kingsley watched her. ""What?"" She cleaned out the sink. ""Patti, you know what."" Kingsley walked into the bedroom and left the bedroom door open. When she joined him, he was climbing into bed. When she laid down and rolled on her side, not facing him, Kingsley ran his fingers through her damp hair. He lowered his voice, although they were quite alone. ""What do you want me to do?"" ""Nothing. Go to sleep."" Patti didn't move. He sat up in bed, thinking hard, for he'd been running this revelation through his mind all day; he couldn't help himself. Kingsley shook her, not letting her nod off. When she insisted Kingsley drop it, he grew angry and relit a candle. ""Why tell me?"" He shot at her. ""You're going to be my husband,"" she said, agitated now, giving up sleep for the time being. She might doze off later, but this wasn't going to be a good eight hours' rest. She took his hand, intertwining their fingers. They said nothing for a while. ""I wanted to tell you. We don't keep secrets. It happened, I got through it, and I'd rather not relive it. It's too late to do anything, anyway, and he'll get reelected."" ""Is that why you left?"" Kingsley rubbed her shoulder. ""Yes and no."" She gave a cryptic answer on purpose, sounding too tired to elaborate. Before he pressed her, she reminded him of the law. ""The statue of limitations has expired. Senators get reelected all the time, Kingsley. It's the system. They asked me to protect Mr. Grimsditch during the election, and I declined. I quit. He's one of what they call the Originals. One of the Twelve, a good old boy, as they say in the States."" ""The Originals."" Kingsley jarred his memory. Kingsley had heard of the Original Twelve Aurors in the United States of America. He knew the name, although he knew next to nothing about them. He had been only concerned with Mr. Grimsditch. He was vaguely aware that he painstakingly pieced this together. He draped his hand over her shoulder, she cuddled next to him. Again, they fell into a comfortable silence. ""Patti. Patti?"" Kingsley lifted their linked hands. Patti's grip broke apart because she finally drifted off to sleep. Her other hand rested on his chest. Kingsley raised his head a little and blew out the candle, calling it a night. He whispered, for he had no idea if she heard him or not as he listened to her soft breathing. He shifted, pressing his lips to her forehead. ""I love you still. No matter what."""
91,0,22,0-LunaStellaCat-22.txt,harry-potter,LunaStellaCat,"between the grilles. He hesitated, but he went there cautiously. ""So … this isn't weird?"" Andromeda rolled her eyes at the ceiling, swearing left, right, and centre they'd been through this. Yes, they wouldn't have dreamed of breaching this subject had either of their children been alive. In a sense, and Lyall hoped this wouldn't be a pregnant pause of awkwardness when Teddy got older and heard the story of how the grandparents met, Remus and Nymphadora had brought them together. Because half of all marriages failed, would it be strange if they signed divorce papers five years from now? Definitely. ""It's weird it you make it weird, I suppose. Don't make it weird.""But it happened. Lyall couldn't think of another way to break this down for him. ""We're not Remus and Nymphadora. And you're running late, son."" Harry had apparently decided work could wait because this was worth it. He stepped outside the lift, apologizing to the crowd. The lift moved on. ""Yeah, I know."" ""See! We needed him for that part where the justice says, 'Speak now or forever hold your peace.' And those witnesses? Who the hell were those people?"" Andromeda strode back towards the register office, insisting they could fix this. ""Nobody says that anymore,"" said Lyall dismissively, choosing not to point out the justice, or the official, or whoever didn't say this as part of his spiel minutes ago. It was an overused plot device used in cheap Sickle novels and Muggle movies. Plus, witnesses were witnesses. ""You need more coffee or tea before you agree to marry someone!"" ""Where are you going, Grams?"" asked Teddy. Andromeda strode back over to them and ignored Harry's commentary about how old people were fun. She smacked him playfully with her handbag. ""Do you seriously not want to be married to me?"" Lyall shooed Harry away when he said he was really running late. He didn't get a yes or no right away, and this gave him pause. Andromeda answered him and Teddy made the icky face again. Lyall took that as good enough, but he fought to get this out. They broke apart. ""Because I don't care either way. But if you don't know you know, we shouldn't have done this. I'm fine."" ""I know."" She sounded like she wanted to put a screeching halt to this conversation. It was an answer a teenager would give. Lyall, frustrated, and admittedly a little disappointed, started back the way she'd gone. His other wedding ring was in his pocket. ""Please stop."" Lyall ignored her and continued on his way. He wondered how long an annulment would take to push through the system. ""Lyall."" All in all, it really didn't matter whether he'd tied the knot with Andromeda or not, but she'd asked him. That was a weird move; Lyalll had never expected a woman to ask for his hand in marriage. She'd asked him before the adoption got finalized. There had been a lot of paperwork to go through at the Ministry after the war, so this got pushed onto the back burner. At sixty-nine, the last thing he expected was to become a father again. Never mind a husband! Harry was right, though, because other than the paperwork, nothing had changed. ""Stay here. Do not move."" Andromeda spoke to Teddy. Eric, the security wizard, who had been rather entertained by this soap opera, said he had the boy. Andromeda, saying this arrangement was pointless, grabbed Lyall by the arm and kissed him like never before. ""I asked you."" ""Great. Are you done scaring me to death over this? I've got things to do."" Lyall ignored Eric's snickering, or he imagined he heard the man say something; the man pretended to read the Daily Prophet . ""Yes."" Andromeda took one of Teddy's hands. ""What're we doing today?"" Teddy walked in between his grandparents. Andromeda would be heading to work soon, which is why they and planned this first thing in the morning. ""Breakfast. I'm starving."" Lyall made the call. They went back through the visitors' entrance. As it turned out, Teddy had not inherited his father's lycanthropy. In hindsight, Lyall wished he had passed that information onto Remus before Teddy was born because it would've saved Remus a world of worry. Although Lyall was no expert, he'd become quite the unofficial authority on all things werewolf. ""Where are you doing today?"" Andromeda nodded at a Muggle couple as they stepped awkwardly out of the red telephone box. After stopping by St. Mungo's to sign off on Remus's patient histories for a clinical study that had lasted for thirty years of Remus's life, he was off to see Newt Scamander. ""Oh. It's one of those days. All right."" Lyall draped his arm over her shoulder. ""Don't act like that."" ""I'm kidding. Tell Mr. Scamander I said hello."" ""Of course. See you later."" Lyall scooped up Teddy, asking him if he wanted to met an old man, an author, before he kicked the bucket. Teddy had no idea what bucket he was talking about. Andromeda made a strange tutting noise and reminded Lyall he spoke to a small boy. She Disapparated after kissing them goodbye. Newt really was ready to move on, but he wished to cross things off his actual bucket list. Today, they'd be headed to Arizona to say goodbye to old Frank. ""You get to travel to Arizona. International Side-Along Apparition. Lucky you."" Lyall set the alarm on this his watch for half past four, promising Teddy they'd be back before Harry arrived. Hopefully. They'd have to swing by Dorset by to get Mr. Scamander first, but Lyall had a plan. He lifted Teddy and smiled when the boy wrapped his arms around his neck. ""Are you ready?"" ""Grandpa, what about breakfast?"" Teddy made a good point. ""Wait until meet Tina Scamander. You'll be best buddies. Ready?"" Teddy said yes. Lyall filled his head with thoughts of Dorset and Disapparated. It was going to be a good day."

He wasn't changing his mind and kept things casual, no strings attached. ""It's just an observation."" She traced the Dark Mark on his arm. ""Tell about this, and we'll discuss the ring."" ""Why?"" Severus rolled his eyes. Why would she want to hear about his past? As she was Muggle-born, this could only lead to a talk and end in a row. (He had indeed found out she was Muggle-born.) He chuckled darkly, saying this without thinking about it. He really needed to filter. ""Your fiancé's not going to suddenly come out of hiding, is he?"" Charity rolled her eyes and got up, tying the strap of her dressing gown. He thought she was going to kick him out, for he'd earned it with this comment, but Charity let it started pacing her bedroom. ""What did you do, Severus? It can't be that bad."" ""It is,"" he said darkly, glaring at her. He sat up in the bed as she tended the fire. Charity argued with him all the time, though she rarely kicked him out of her quarters. She might lose it if she learned the truth. He spoke to her plainly, throwing out a guess. ""Is this about the Chamber of Secrets?"" ""What if it is? It all boils down to the same thing."" Charity stepped back from the fire. She didn't fear being taken, but there was no mistaking her frightened demeanor. She shrugged. ""Students want to drop my course, and who am I to stop them? How do I educate them about Muggles when they are being targeted?"" ""This will pass."" Severus angered her by merely rolling his eyes. This was ridiculous. The heir of Slytherin wouldn't target people for taking on a school subject. When she asked how he knew this, Severus lost his patience, too. The moment she mentioned Lockhart, he said, ""You actually think Albus Dumbledore puts his trust in that pretty idiot? No."" Charity halted in front of the bed. ""How do you know?"" ""Because I know. It is common sense. Do you trust Lockhart?"" Severus sighed when she shook her head vehemently. ""There you are. You don't need to know, so please don't ask me."" ""Why?"" Severus hissed through gritted teeth. ""It doesn't concern you. Why are you worried?"" ""Because I fear it. I fear everything!"" ""Oh, you're a Seer now, are you?"" Severus got out of bed and got dressed. He tired of dealing with a hysterical woman. If he knew the next step in the plan, if there was a plan, he wouldn't share it with her. He needed to remind her, although Severus seriously doubted she'd forgotten the unwritten terms of their agreement. ""What is this we're doing, Charity?"" ""We're lovers, nothing more,"" she said, slumping her shoulders. She sat on the bed and braided her hair with quick fingers. ""The ring? I don't what to forget what it cost me, so I wear it. You were one of them, Severus, you have no idea what it was like living as a Muggle under You-Know-Who."" ""Don't I?"" Severus asked evenly as he slipped on his shoes. He ought to tell her about Mr. Dearborn right now. What was the worst she could do? Charity had never raged at him before. Sure, he would end this, and she'd never speak to him again, but it was nothing more than love. This, too, would pass. ""Listen to me."" ""Jasper Montague."" She threw out a name wildly. Severus stopped, forgetting his damned confession once again. He stared at her, dumbfounded. ""What?"" ""If whatever monster on the Chamber took Jasper, you'd be furious, and you'd stop at nothing of that boy got Petrified. I know you. There hasn't been another Montague."" ""He has a half-brother, the Captain of the Quidditch team,"" said Severus, the sides of his mouth twitching. He sat beside her, a little disappointed she didn't share in his joke. He didn't know what he did to earn a kiss, but he took it. She sighed when their lips parted. ""You know what I meant. There will never be another Montague. I bet you'll go mad looking for one."" Jasper Montague had perfected the Time-lapse Draught in a few short years. She was right. He'd known this the day he saluted Jasper Montague as he'd climbed into the thestral-drawn carriage and took the traditional journey away from Hogwarts Castle. Jasper, laughing heartily, had waved his journal, his receipt book, at the potions master. Severus had forgotten to give the young man a parting gift, his own copy of Advanced Potion Making . Severus kept forgetting to send it. Severus squeezed her hand. ""There shall not be another Montague. His brother's an idiot."" ""Thank you,"" said Charity, relieved, saying this like he said it purely for her benefit. Severus wasn't going to admit such a thing. ""I'd thought you'd gone stupid on me for a moment. One brother is not like the other."" Severus sat back, thinking about this carefully. He spoke slowly, making the first move. ""I tolerate you quite well."" ""Oh, you flatter me."" Charity poured on the melodrama, placing her hand over her heart. ""Those are words every girl wants to hear, Severus."" ""What I was going to say before you so rudely interrupted me,"" said Severus, dryly, letting her finish and getting up to make her bed, ""and thank you for that, was that we should be friends. I'd like to be your friend."" She raised an eyebrow, clearly making him spell this out. ""And we've doing what exactly?"" ""You try my patience, Charity."" Charity got up and helped him with the other side of the bed, pulling the covers tight and rearranging the pillows, although she also added there was little point in making a bed when she simply messed it every night. ""The house-elf would do it,"" he pointed out, walking towards the door. ""Good night."""
93,0,38,0-LunaStellaCat-38.txt,harry-potter,LunaStellaCat,"and you are still my favorite librarian. Thank you for forgiving all my late fines and holding all the good ones for me. George Tidwell shall never find another like you. Here's to hoping you are well. A very happy birthday to you. David.'"" Lily laughed, tucking the letter safely back in place. ""You hid books for my father? That's how Dad got to read all the best-sellers first?"" Eileen nodded. ""No."" She'd never reveal her secrets nor her sources. Lily, reaching into her schoolbag, snorted. She sat down beside Lily. ""Your father is extraordinarily kind, Lily. Most people aren't like that. David Evans is a gift. And he's almost always right."" ""About what?"" Lily waited as Eileen drafted a letter and sealed it with a sharp of her wand. Lily took it cautiously when the librarian offered it to her. ""Send that to your father, please. I could send it to him, but he probably enjoys receiving letters from you. You're a good girl."" Eileen got lost in the girl's green eyes before she considered the poor families breeding like rabbits scenario. Poverty came with it. It was a cliché, or or might've been, yet it held a simple truth. Love, even physical love, made people feel better. She'd hated her husband, truly despised him, but there were nights when they had made love until they'd both passed out from exhaustion. How would the Evans family, especially David Evans, not have noticed? ""I was pregnant four times,"" she said, pleased she wasn't really lying to the girl. Eileen didn't tell her the whole truth and spared her the details. What was a delicate way to phrase this? Lily was older, maybe just a little older, but she'd asked the question. ""Tobias isn't a nice man."" ""That's an understatement,"" said Lily. Eileen eyed her carefully, her tone even. ""How much do you know? No. How much do you think you know, Lily?"" Lily tucked a loose strand of hair behind her ear, biting her lower lip. Eileen waited, busied herself with making coffee, and returned with two large mugs. When Lily asked for sugar, Eileen went back and got some. She sat down again, and Lily took a sip. ""Wow. That's strong stuff."" Lily held her mug in her hands. ""Former university student,"" said Eileen apologetically. On the plus side, if the girl planned on hitting the books, she'd been up all night. Eileen made it through school whilst working full-time and raising a kid on this brew. She wanted to be direct, not unkind. Since the girl had asked, Eileen decided on the spot not to sugarcoat this. If David Evans sent her an owl later, she'd deal with the consequences. ""Do you know what a battered housewife is?"" Lily shook her head. Eileen, explaining this badly, started from the beginning. ""You said Mr. Evans thought I might be dead, child. Why is that?"" ""You ... you know why. That man ... he uses you as his punchbag. He ..."" Lily hid her face in her hands. Eileen wanted to hear her say it. Even though Lily might think she was ready, a sheltered, privileged girl enjoyed her protection. Lily paused, not saying anything for a while. Eileen, satisfied, thought the girl had realized she really didn't want to know the truth. Lily pointed a shaky finger at her after knocking over her coffee, and the stuff spilled onto the floor. ""Oh, my God. A couple years ago, when I walked Severus home, you said you fell down the stairs! And my dad rushed over after closing up shop and hurried to get Mr. Tidwell. Mr. Tidwell carried you back upstairs. You didn't even cry."" ""I didn't even realize you were there,"" said Eileen honestly, sipping her coffee. Lily asked how many times this happened. Eileen threw up three fingers, her expression blank. She cleared her throat, desperately wanting to get this out of the way. ""Lily, whatever he's done or whatever he's said, Severus isn't Tobias. I never should've equated all Muggles to that man because I was wrong. George Tidwell saved my life countless times; he tried saving that last baby, and his wife agreed to take us in. Called it Sarah. Ever read Michael Branson? There's a Sarah there."" Lily smiled, shaking her head. ""Mr. Tidwell and his books."" ""Books allow you to look for the soul and the meaning. George told me that. I should've gone with him."" Eileen stopped, momentarily lost in her memories. She sniffed, remembering this wasn't originally her point. She went back to it. ""Lily, we all do things, we all say things we don't mean. Severus ..."" ""Severus meant it,"" said Lily flatly, finishing her coffee and setting the empty mug on the table. ""I understand you don't see people like that. And I appreciate it, Eileen, but he's not like you. You can't change him ... I've tried, all right? He's cruel. If he called Mr. Tidwell a ... that word whilst walking down the street, what would you do? Honest answer?"" ""George? I'd purchase a bar of soap in the nearest shop, and we'd clear up that problem."" Eileen nodded curtly, smiling slightly at Lily's look of indignation. Eileen, a simple, stupid housewife in Cokeworth, wouldn't have risked using magic. In truth, Severus probably would've fought her off. But nobody played with Severus Snape or George Tidwell in her mind. Eileen reached over and patted the girl on the knee. She and Lily had never been close; Eileen wasn't close to many students in this place, though she considered adding Lily Evans to the list. Severus was Severus. He wasn't a monster like his father, yet he wasn't the greatest person to have as a friend. Severus had stayed resolutely, comfortably in the middle, and he'd turned a deaf eat to her pleas and stories. Eileen said good night to Lily and she wondered whether this girl could change her son's heart and make him see the light."

Charlie answered her with a high-five and choked on his cannoli. ""No. It's ice cream. You can find ice cream anywhere. Are we having ice cream and cake?"" ""Please, somebody, for the love of Merlin, find this man some ice cream,"" said Nymphadora, checking for watch as the sun got higher. ""Five in the morning. He needs it."" ""I needs it. Yessss,"" said Rolf, releasing the dragons to haunt after cattle and sheep. ""What's your favorite?"" Lyall refiled Newt's cup. ""Oh, there's this honey lavender ice cream in … somewhere."" Rolf snapped his fingers at Charlie, trying to jog his memory. ""The gypsy at hospital."" ""Deva. Yeah, Scamander got spoonfed by some beautiful girl when some Hungarian Horntail turned him into a human torch."" Charlie nudged Nymphadora and snickered with her. ""He almost got some."" ""Scamander,"" said Nymphadora, impressed. ""Are we breaking the bromance?"" ""Charlie's sleeping with her,"" said Rolf, shrugging it off. ""Yes, Charlie is."" Charlie raised his hands to the sky. ""Your best friend's lying there dying of severe burns,"" said Nymphadora, pointing at Rolf, ""and you're getting a date. With a girl."" ""Extremely attractive Romanian gypsy who serves the Heartstrings Sanctuary, thank you very much,"" clarified Charlie. ""You're worth money. Lots of it. You speak three languages,"" said Nymphadora, waving her hand in Rolf's direction. ""Your face graces magazines. What's the problem, Newton? Have you met yourself?"" ""You're married, Dora,"" Remus reminded her quietly. ""Yeah, not for me."" Nymphadora patted Remus on the knee. She turned to Rolf. ""I'm not trying to make you feel uncomfortable. I don't get it."" ""Yeah."" Rolf shuffled his feet, obviously uncomfortable. Remus asked how much he worked, which Lyall thought took as a nice gesture of giving him an out. Rolf shrugged, not taking Nymphadora's comments as criticism. ""Twelve or thirteen hours a day? I don't know … I just … it doesn't stop. Not that that's a problem. I do stuff."" ""Yeah, Scamander, you kidnap freaking dragons, which is awesome,"" said Nymphadora, waving at the giant lizard-like creature. A stripped, burning sheep carcass landed feet away from them. She lowered her voice, clearly not making her point. ""Whoa, whoa, on the kidnapping charge. This is … they are our charges. No jail. Let's leave that out of the conversation because they are visiting Mr. Scamander."" Charlie raised his hands in defense and went to go tend the dragons when they simmered down. Newt followed him and waved at Lyall to come along. Charlie made a show of shaking his head sadly and grumbled like an old lady as he walked away. ""I'm not trying to sent to jail by an Auror, so you pretend you never saw any of this."" ""They're thirty feet long, but okay,"" said Nymphadora. ""Man. Control your wife, Remus. That's why you didn't get a wedding gift."" Charlie pointed at Nymphadora and nodded solemnly at Remus. He reached within a harness and tossed Remus an old rucksack. ""I'm kidding. This is old cookware from Romania."" ""Thank you,"" said Remus, stackin he pots and pans. ""You cook?"" ""His wife does,"" said Nymphadora cheerfully, clapping Rolf on the back. She exchanged a look with Charlie. Charlie burst out laughing as he helped Newt and and Lyall onto a dragon. ""Bromance still going strong then? No, seriously, Charlie, he needs a wife, and we can't leave him alone."" ""I didn't marry Tina until I was thirty-something. I'm old. I can't remember."" Newt sat up front, comfortable although he hadn't been astride a dragon for a while. Lyall, his teeth chattering as he shook in his bones, asked to be taken off as he really, really didn't want to do this. Newt, smiling slightly, let go of the dragon's scales and patted Lyall awkwardly. ""No, no, you are my source of entertainment today, Mr. Lupin."" ""That's what I'm afraid of."" Lyall quietly accepted his fate. After thirty years of a close friendship with this man, Lyall pretty much expected to get roped into crazy schemes, and a lot of it honestly wasn't so bad because he got introduced to new things, and Mr. Scamander didn't believe in a dull day. The magi-zoologist had been retired since 1990. Lyall believed the man didn't know what a quiet retirement was. Charlie and Rolf got on the other dragon. Lyall didn't bother to turn his head to see Remus laughing as they put the old men to shame. Newt might've done this back in the day; he claimed he manned Ukrainian Ironbellies in the First World War, which Lyall couldn't even imagine, yet old age caught up with him. Charlie and Rolf acted like this was nothing. It probably wasn't. ""I really want to be on the ground."" Lyall raised his voice as the beast beat its massive wings and prepared to take flight. Newt learned from Rolf their dragon, a female, was called Claire. ""Great. Give the great, fire-breathing dragon a name! Yes. Wait. Aren't females more ferocious."" ""Yes. You did read my book. I'm flattered."" Newt shifted his position as Claire lifted off the ground and followed Charlie and Rolf's dragon. Lyall locked the old man in a death grip, frightened he'd crack his ribs. ""I know it's your birthday, Newt, and you're my best mate,"" said Lyall, burying his face in Newt's shoulder. ""But I hate you. You have a death wish."" Newt's body shook with laughter. He kicked Claire, making her turn and change course, and he told Lyall to take a deep breath and open his eyes. Lyall did. The wingspan startled him before he found it oddly comforting. Charlie, showing off, pointed at a nearby herd of deer as their stronger dragon took chase. Lyall spotted Nymphadora and Remus on the ground, mere specks, and he decided to sit back and enjoy the ride. They really weren't the worst things in the world. Dragons."

Emmeline swore she picked up something in Gideon's voice when he suggested Mundungus talk to Professor Dumbledore about joining the Order as they had no sway in this decision. Gideon changed his first nappy, pulling it off flawlessly like he'd been doing it for years because he'd had a lot of practice with Molly's children. He passed the baby off to Emmeline, calling her Sophie, and kissed her forehead. ""Sophie."" Emmeline touched the baby's nose and smiled at the sound of the name. Fabian gave the full name, Sophie Jacqueline Charlotte Marceau, something he had in his back trouser pocket a long time ago. ""Charlotte. That's the fourth generation to carry that name."" ""Uh huh."" Fabian swung the rucksack over his shoulder and invited Mundungus to leave first. Fabian swept the room, careful not to touch anything not leave a hair out of place because the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. He winked at Emmeline, saying he needed time with this favorite niece. (She was his only one.) Fabian lived for the single life of a bachelor and strayed away from commitment like the plague or dragon pox, so he went with seasonal attractions when it came to women. He didn't date anyone at the Ministry or the Order of the Phoenix on principle, because this added unnecessary melodrama to his life, and chances were, someone would end up dead. ""Marriage isn't end of the world."" Emmeline took Gideon's hand and hoped she never got stranded in the Paris ghetto again. Fabian, walking backwards, turned to Gideon like he needed a translation to get filled in on the conversation. Emmeline took her wand when he offered it to her. She got the joke. ""Oh, you're hilarious, Mr. Prewett. It was in English, thank you very much."" ""It was funny."" Gideon, the responsible and eldest one, sounded tired. They stopped by the hospital to get the baby checked out. Emmeline zoned out when the officers from the Department of Magical Law Enforcement questioned her. Gideon snapped his fingers under her nose and advised someone, any Healer, to run a rape kit. Emmeline declined this as a pointless step, but she did it anyway after she gave her statement. They asked thrice to catch things or holes in her story. ""Fabian's got to file a report."" ""No."" Emmeline silently cursed herself as tears spilled into her hair. Why had she showered before thinking of this procedure? There was nothing to gather, of course, yet any lawyer with half a brain would ask why. Gideon sat at her head and ran his fingers through her hair. ""Time needs to slow down for a few nights. Please."" Gideon turned his head and spoke to Fabian on the other side of the curtain. ""Yeah, that's fine. I'll stay."" Fabian cursed when Gideon told him not to hang around France simply to get buried underneath a mountain of paperwork, parchment, and assignment. ""What did I say, Monsieur Negotiator?"" ""He's staying in Paris,"" said Gideon brightly, rubbing his hands together. Fabian tacked on an insult at the end. ""I'm supposed to be in Madrid and then Seville in three hours."" ""That's not happening,"" laughed Emmeline, shaking her head and putting her clothes back on. After they double checked everything, she left the hospital gown on the bed and signed a birth certificate with Gideon. They listed the religion as Roman Catholicism and Sophie's nationality as French because Gideon held a dual citizenship by marriage. ""You've got a sidekick."" Fabian purchased an old-fashioned black pram from a nearby shop, got a date with the proprietor, and came back to get them ready to head back home. Fabian asked if they wanted to go to Calais. Gideon said no. They went into the small house and got situated. Emmeline nearly crawled out her skin when she backtracked and saw Albus Dumbledore sitting in the dark sitting room; none of them caught this on the first turn. He sat with his fingertips together and buried his face in his weathered hands. ""I took your papa's key,"" he said, placing it on the table. He studied Emmeline's face. ""She's dead,"" Emmeline said emotionlessly, in a matter-of-fact tone and nodded when Dumbledore asked if she was all right. ""No."" ""What do you need?"" Dumbledore stayed put and set her on track; he caught the Deluminator with a quick hand when she tossed it in the air. ""There's a funeral? Notre Dame. I think … she devoted her research to the University of Paris. There's a eulogy … I can't … I can't."" ""Gabriel asked to take that responsibility."" Dumbledore waited for permission. Emmeline hated that she wasn't there to say goodbye, and he coaxed this out of her. He got up and embraced her. ""Look at me. No, sweet girl, she knew. You were there. She wasn't … she left the other day."" Emmeline asked how he knew this. ""She called me Nicolas and asked me to read the next chapter. There was no book."" Dumbledore reached in his robes and handed her a Rosary, Jacqueline's Rosary, and an ordinary silver cigarette lighter. His eyes twinkled when Gideon handed him a wrapped bundle. ""This is the new Mademoiselle Marceau? She's beautiful. Hello."" Sophie, of course, said nothing, though her small arm had wringed out of the blanket, and Dumbledore kissed her hand before he went to sit back down. While Fabian went to drop his things in the bedroom, Gideon sat beside Emmeline on the couch as the professor shared a story about a homeless girl called Jacqueline. Emmeline flicked the lighter absentmindedly and played with the illuminating blue flame. Professor Dumbledore paused, thinking as he replaced his half-moon spectacles on his crooked nose, and smiled when Emmeline suggested he start at the beginning. *""Keep your distance, you drunkard."" *""You are safe with this man. He's with me, Emmeline. You're not alone."", a broken translation"

Mad-Eye had dropped the Mr. Longbottom nonsense, yet Dewey, agitated, found himself wishing the Auror would pick it up again. What was he getting at? ""All right, say she wakes up in a year or a year and a half. And you hand her this baby who's the spitting image of Crouch?"" ""Crouch's son might've simply been in the wrong place at the wrong time."" Dewey voiced popular opinion. ""Not the point. That was me being nice, but you're right!"" Mad-Eye's tone leaked with sarcasm. ""Wouldn't Bellatrix Lestrange love to know her filthy husband gave your son a bastard?"" Nauseous, Dewey pushed away from the table. ""If you defend these people, they will eat you alive, Dewey. You know how rare your son is? Alice was a gift. A gift!"" Mad-Eye pounded his fist on the table and made Dewey jump. He put the starter on a carryout box and set it down. ""What would Alice do?"" ""I don't know."" Augusta had asked the same question, and Dewey gave the same answer. Was he supposed to change his mind because he spoke to an officer? If he'd known what was best for his family, didn't they think he would've done it already? Mad-Eye waved the waiter down and ordered two orders of the day's special. Dewey paid for the meal. ""Want to go up to the hospital?"" asked Mad-Eye. ""Yes, please,"" said Dewey. They walked the short distance to St. Mungo's. After they passed through the sheer barrier, Dewey flashed his hospital badge at the security wizard, although he was pretty sure this fellow knew him by sight. He led Mad-Eye towards the ward. Mad-Eye carried the food. ""He resembles you,"" said Mad-Eye. ""Frank?"" Dewey smiled, for he heard this a lot. He played with the stuff inside his robes. Mad-Eye rolled his eyes. Dewey, thinking he'd unintentionally offended this man yet again, stopped fidgeting. ""Sorry."" ""Why are you apologizing? He does that, too. Frank fidgets."" Mad-Eye's anger had evaporated as quickly as it came. ""Do you know annoying it is during an interrogation to watch a grown man craft a chain out of Muggle paperclips? He makes me want to throttle him."" Dewey shrugged. ""Paperclips. I count matchsticks."" ""Strange. Fool, they put the count on the outside of box. Can you read?"" Mad-Eye walked into the ward after taking a detour. He joined Dewey. ""Alice."" Few people outside of Dewey and Augusta and got privileges to see Frank and Alice. When they had gotten moved onto the permanent residents' ward, Dewey had added Alastor Moody to this list. Dewey didn't follow visiting hours, and the hospital respected his space. ""I have food. Actual food."" Mad-Eye handed both Alice and Frank their food and things of plastic silverware; they shared the starter. Dewey helped his son and his wife into chairs as Mad-Eye told them of the abysmal candidate interviews. Neither of them added anything to the conversation, and Mad-Eye acted like this happened all the time. ""Trial ended today. We've got the bastards."" ""We didn't stay for closing arguments,"" added Dewey. ""We went drinking,"" said Mad-Eye, unashamed he'd left during a court proceeding. Dewey suspected he'd done this off and on throughout the years. ""Crouch is the law; the law is Crouch. Wonder how long that's going to last. I bet went it gets out there, Mr. Crouch shall fall from grace."" Dewey didn't know what to say to this. The inner workings of the Ministry of Magic had never really interested him, although Frank and Alice had shared some good stories with him. Dewey hardly entertained gossip within the walls of St. Mungo's. Mad-Eye broke the news about Alice to Frank. ""You two are the best officers I have ever had the privilege of working with,"" he said, placing a hand on Alice's knee. When they had announced their engagement, Mad-Eye had been against them tying the knot. ""Notice I did not say, 'Probably,', Frank. And you can keep your comments to yourselves, thank you very much."" Dewey chuckled. Mad-Eye turned towards Alice and touched her pale face. Although they were insane, these two kept good care of themselves, although they sometimes got lost on a train of thought leading to nowhere. Mad-Eye wiped her face with a napkin, and Alice didn't fight at his touch. She continued eating. ""I think she knows your voice,"" said Dewey. Alice seemed to follow the sound of it before she got lost again. ""She used to hate me,"" said Mad-Eye, and he definitely smiled at Dewey this time. He returned it, surprised this man smiled at all. When he turned back to Alice, he reached in his inside pocket and handed her a tube of lip balm. Alice applied to her cracked lips after she finished her food. ""Alice. I know you're in there. If you can hear me, if you are getting any of this, I need you to nod or something."" Alice offered him the empty container. ""That doesn't count,"" said Dewey. He'd thought she'd kissed him on the cheek when he'd helped her to bed a few nights ago. Mad-Eye nodded, his tone devoid of emotion. ""Absinthe."" He got to his mismatched feet. ""You asked my opinion, Dewey, and I've given it Absinthe. She can't … if Alice isn't there, she's not registering any of it. Make it painless. You'll forget it ever happened."" ""I cannot do that."" Dewey rubbed his hands together. ""You'll find those lines get blurred,"" said Mad-Eye. It wouldn't be difficult to find a solution to this unfortunate problem. Mad-Eye reached into his robes and handed Dewey two boxes of matches. He usually came by on the weekends. He shook Frank's hand and kissed Alice on the cheek after he whispered softly in her ear. With a parting wave, he left. Dewey sat back and counted his matches. He was missing two."

""No, no,"" said Savvy. Savvy pulled a straight face and searched around desperately for another topic. She looked angry, which is how Klein guessed she usually acted, and helped herself to her husband's tankard of Guinness. She snapped her fingers. ""Why did it take us seven years to meet? And don't feed me some doctor and lawyer nonsense. I like you, and I don't even know you."" Klein and Giles slipped into a casual conversation and swapped corny professional jokes for the next fifteen minutes or so and pinged off each other as they giggled like schoolgirls. Savvy called them idiots and ordered another round of drinks. Giles was a talker, and by a talker, he talked circles round people and obviously enjoyed it. They stopped at Margaret Thatcher, though neither of them knew how she got invited into the conversation. ""Idiots."" Savvy paid the tab and promised Klein they'd do whatever they could to get the word out. She explained there was a radio program called Potterwatch, and she'd find answers one way or another. She took Klein's business card and a blue handkerchief. The card carried the logo of a man's hand holding a human heart. They'd rebranded the St. George's Cardiology Group as One Heart to save the practice last year. ""One Heart? Interesting."" ""Who's your graphic designer?"" asked Giles, pulling his coat off the back of the chair and pulling it on. ""My son. That's my hand,"" said Klein proudly. Although he'd left the hospital years ago, Klein and a handful of the other physicians held privileges there. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw what was going to happen before it took place. This happened sometimes, often within the confines of the hospital, where the next steps played out. He got up and grabbed his medical bag. ""Call an ambulance!"" The small black boy sitting opposite with an old lady and slammed onto the floor. Savvy screamed, and she wasn't the only one. Klein told the old lady to back off as he checked for airway, a faint pulse, and circulation. The pulse disappeared altogether. The boy wasn't breathing! And he lay in the remains of his lunch. As he started compressions, Klein shouted at a couple of young waitresses to call an ambulance. Now meant a minute ago. He concentrated on the boy, his patient, and momentarily forgot about this madness called the Muggleborn Registration Committee. ""He needs a proper doctor,"" said a waitress. ""Are you blind? He's got one. You think I do this for kicks?"" Klein swore as he broke the little boy's ribs with his applied pressure asked he interviewed the old lady. He breathed easier and smiled when the boy opened his eyes and the ambulance approached minutes later. ""Welcome back. What's your name?"" ""Colby,"" said the boy. ""Like the cheese? Nice to meet you, Colby. I've got a little boy like you. Well, he's not that little. No worries, Colby. I've got your back. You hear me?"" Colby acted terrified as his eyes darted everywhere. ""Yeah."" Klein hung his stethoscope around his neck and grinned at the Finnigans who stood nearby. Klein chatted with the medical transport as they prepared the patient. He clapped a hand on Savvy's shoulder as he raced with the team. He told the woman, the boy's grandmother, to meet them at St. George's, and jumped in the back of the rig with one of the emergency medical personnel. They slammed the doors shut and the vehicle raced through the streets. Klein got lost in the medicine. Annalise caved after a week because she was ready to murder Norah and Versailles. When Klein pointed out the problem was an excess of estrogen because there were too many women in the house, Annalise advised him not to push it. On the third of May, he showed up at King's Cross in his scrubs and his medical bag. He didn't know how Annalise did this. He hung out in Platform Ten. Dean came out with an arm around a Irish kid, and they were laughing their heads off. Going by the brogue and the hyperactivity, Klein guessed this was Seamus. He started to approach the young man and readied himself for an introduction. Both Seamus and Dean had minor bruises and cuts, and he stopped halfway and left this luggage with Seamus and Savvy. After he wiped his blue handkerchief in the air like a white flag, Dean collided with Klein like a brick wall and ran him down at top speed. Klein felt air rush out of his lungs as they hit the ground. ""You missed me,"" said Dean triumphantly. Seamus howled with laughter. ""You're getting old."" ""Are you sure I missed you? Because you don't call me, or send a letter or an owl."" Klein took Dean's offered hand and got to his feet. He layered the guilt on thick. ""Come on. Tell me I'm your favorite."" Dean said goodbye to his friends and did a double take when Klein saluted Savvy. Dean pushed his trolley towards the black Mercedes and caught the keys when Klein tossed them in the air. Dean got his license last year and rarely got to drive the good car in the city. Klein put the Hogwarts trunk in the back and got in the passenger seat. ""You aren't going to believe any of this."" ""We're not moving. If you think your friends are going to give you cool points for this ride, you ought to have thought about Posey's car seat."" Klein rolled his eyes and recited the magic words. ""You're the favorite. Are we happy now?"" ""Yep."" Dean reeved the engine and joined the queue as he turned down the wireless. ""You are not allowed to tell any of this to Mum, but it's one hell of a story."""
98,0,25,0-LunaStellaCat-25.txt,harry-potter,LunaStellaCat,"me a minute."" He slipped behind a glass partition and slid the door closed. Forty-eight hours. That was how long this took; these cases usually ended really quickly. As he was a Dark Wizard Catcher, Kingsley had handled a handful of them. He'd found a girl once, but she'd been bitten by a werewolf and had succumbed to her injuries. Kingsley had held the dying girl in his arms until she'd taken her last breath. He'd lied to her when he told her it was going to be all right as she bled to death. Kingsley threw up on the floor. When the door slid open, Patti walked inside, flanked by Harry and Ron. Neville brought up the rear. Patti had been off at a press conference. She hugged herself, shaking her head as Ron reeled off the facts. Then he asked about releasing a child alert, she nodded, pale and numb. Ron left, clapping her on the shoulder, and Patti stepped over the pool of sick. ""Where is she?"" She kept her eyes on Kingsley. He had nothing to give her. ""Kingsley, this happens all the time! You know this. She's mine."" ""I know."" He didn't know what else to say. She slapped him. Kingsley didn't flinch and he stared back at her. ""When did this happen?"" Her eyes darted between Harry and Neville. Neville cleaned the sick with a casual wave of his wand. Patti sat down and crossed her legs, impatient and furious. ""I don't know exactly."" Harry spoke up first, leaning against the wall. ""You don't know? That's … that's unacceptable. You want to be an Auror, Mr. Potter? Your name will only get you so far. Same goes for you, Mr. Longbottom. Do you realize who you're talking to?"" Patti stopped in front of Harry. ""Yes, ma'am,"" he said, his voice caught in his throat. ""Patti."" Kingsley marched her out of the private partition and shared the large umbrella with her. ""You are frightening them. These boys … they are doing the best they can."" ""It's not good enough,"" she hissed. ""I want Kaspar. Now!"" ""He's on his way,"" said Kingsley, guessing that they had sent both her and their department head an owl. When she glared at him, her jaw set, he went to send another. This was completely his fault. After he sent it off, borrowing an owl from a traveler, someone who studied birds, he went back to his wife. He found her laughing and crying hysterically, and he couldn't blame Harry and Neville for hiding. He rapped his knuckles on the glass, and they came out. Kingsley knelt on the floor and questioned her patiently. Kaspar arrived on the scene resembling a drowned rat. His ponytail clung to the back of his neck. ""What's wrong?"" Kingsley asked this more than once. Patti went into this story about how she'd prepared this home cooked meal and rearranged her Saturday timetable. Kingsley thanked her. She'd mentioned the other day she had news, and he'd blown her off, absorbed in budget cut proposals. He had a lot on his plate, and he rarely did this move, but it happened too frequently these days. When Kingsley asked if this was about redecorating the sitting room, she hissed through gritted teeth, making sure he caught every word. ""I am pregnant, you blind moron."" ""Oh."" Kingsley's face fell. ""Oh? Oh? You said that last time, too."" Patti dropped the subject when Kaspar cleared his throat loudly. She turned to face him. ""Charge is Rachelle Delta Shacklebolt, aged four. She has a birth mark behind her left ear?"" Kaspar turned to Kingsley for confirmation. He said yes. Kaspar continued, reading off the alert. ""Is she a citizen here?"" ""No. I mean, I have dual-citizenship, but she was born in New York."" Patti fished a copy of the birth certificate out of her large handbag and handled it over. She glanced at all of them in turn. Harry decided to study his trainers. ""Does that matter?"" ""No."" Kaspar took the birth certificate and added it to the file. He matched only Kingsley in his organization skills. He placed his hand on Patti's shoulder. ""Is there anything else you need to tell me?"" ""She speaks French,"" Kingsley offered, fishing, ""and she's afraid of the dark."" ""Oh, God."" Patti took quick, swallow breaths. Before she could walk away, Kaspar draped his traveling cloak over the wet bench and forced her to sit down beside him. ""Patti, I've got this handled. You hear me?"" Kaspar waved his wand and caught a goblet. He gave her a Calming Draught. He snapped his fingers at Harry and Neville and asked for an interpreter. He waited the Floo Network grounded and International Customs searched. Patti immediately offered herself, but he refused. When they turned to leave, he stopped Harry. ""Potter, I want transcripts of the Death Eater trials in my office in thirty minutes, please, and I want Gawain Robards on this one. You're taking lead."" ""Me?"" Harry did a double take. ""He's a kid, Kaspar, a fledgling,"" said Patti. ""You're the mother, not the officer here, Patti,"" said Kaspar, and Kingsley was astounded he didn't pull rank here. He silenced her with a look and turned back to Harry. ""You got this?"" ""Yeah, yeah,"" said Harry, sounding like he didn't have this at all. He took the folder Kaspar offered him, cast the Germinio Charm, handed over a copy and bowed awkwardly at Kingsley and Patti before he and Neville left King's Cross. Kaspar sat with Patti until she told him she was all right. Kingsley knew she'd lied straight through her teeth. As Kaspar had effectively told her to stand down, Kingsley followed the same orders. Kaspar had offered to walk them home. When they arrived at the flat, Kingsley said thank you, keeping it short and sweet. There was a faint pop as Kaspar Disapparated, and Patti broke down in Kingsley's arms the moment he locked the door with the magical deadbolt."

She backed off apologetically, taking her handkerchief back. ""Someone released the dragon!"" ""Three guesses who,"" said Rolf darkly, kneeling onto the cobblestones. ""So much for a holiday."" ""We're in Deva, which basically means we're on holiday,"" said Luna, heading back the other way to head towards wherever Charlie went. They abandoned the panda. As they approached, inching along, for whatever reason, the silvery-blue dragon, a Swedish Short Snout, came back, and the people scattered for cover when it dove like a spiraling missile towards its brunch, the smoldering remains of a good meal. Rolf got lifted off the ground and something tore in his shoulder. He couldn't see her because he got slammed into a derelict building and destroyed vendor stands, but Luna's screams, unnatural and deep, pierced the crisp air and sent chills down his spine. Rolf tasted the blood in his mouth and spat onto the ground; he'd bitten his tongue hard because it compared to nothing as it ripped into him. ""Run,"" he gasped, turning his head at an odd angle and reaching out to his wife. Rolf shoved Luna away roughly. Rolf relied on the wrong thing, an assumption, a dangerous thing, for he knew the Swedish breed wouldn't attack humans, but this one already possessed a taste for blood, and it shot fire from its nostrils, playing with its prey. Rolf cried out as his arm got set aflame, and the dragon took off in broad daylight. ""I'm not leaving you,"" she said shakily, her voice going in and out as she conjured a fire blanket and wrapped it around him. ""Shhhh, shhhh."" Charlie, a tank, cast spells and managed the scene poorly because it was simply too much to handle for one man. Ned, the nobody who knew nothing, stayed at his heels, white as a sheet. ""Damnit."" Charlie shouted at Ned to gather any of the handlers and alert everyone. Frightened, hiding his emotions, he stuck a grin on his face and patted Rolf on the shoulder as Luna helped him get Rolf on level ground. Muggles surrounded them. ""Luna, put him down, come on."" ""He's …"" Luna knelt awkwardly on the ground and burst into tears. Charlie told her to stop crying as she gulped for air. ""I can't … I can't believe this! We were going out for fresh air."" ""She can't stop once she gets going,"" said Rolf, staring at Charlie, smelling his own charred flesh. His nerves felt as though they got set on fire, too. ""I love you."" ""You shut the hell up! I'm not hearing that, Scamander! Luna. Your cloak!"" Charlie, keeping it together, holding on by his fingertips, snapped at Luna. Charlie slid it onto the stained ground and moved Rolf onto it, careful with his man. Authorities Apparated in the distance and Charlie barked orders mingled with colored insults at Ned. ""If he dies, I will kill you!"" ""I…"" Words failed Ned. He appealed to Luna, a train wreck, and Rolf heard her strike him. ""You've done enough today. No! You … you do not touch me."" Luna, big, crawled on her hands and knees towards Rolf. ""You keep your eyes on me."" ""Look at your lady, Rolf,"" said Charlie, doing things Rolf couldn't see. ""They're coming. Help is … it's on it's way."" ""Charlie, it hurts,"" said Rolf. He understood how this worked, so they couldn't lie to him like an idiot. He wasn't sure of the breed, but he felt the venom coursing through him as his body warmed in the cool autumnal air. ""I know, I know,"" said Charlie, his tone faltering a little. ""Slow your heart rate,"" said Luna, stroking his face. Rolf wanted to go to sleep and close his eyes. ""No, Newton, you look at me! Tell me about … tell me a story."" ""What?"" Rolf cried out when Charlie ripped off his clothes. ""Anything, Rolf, tell me anything,"" said Luna meekly, trying desperately to calm herself. ""The tavern wench with the uneven teeth,"" suggested Charlie, working fast. ""We'll find that gypsy who tended you last time at clinic. What's her name?"" ""Charlie."" Rolf jerked his head at Luna. Charlie snorted. ""We're all friends here. You laid with Luna this morning. She got you in the end, at least for the next seventeen years, so it's all good, Pudgy Badger. Wouldn't Tonks be pleased you almost bedded a whore?"" Rolf laughed painfully, like a knife in the chest, as he recalled Nymphadora Tonks's heart-shaped face and violet locks. The gypsies from the nearby clinic and placed him on a stretcher, and Luna, her dress stained with his blood, let someone help her to her feet and stayed by his side. He stroked her face with his bloody fingers, raising his broken hand, stalling the transport for a moment. ""Charlie, you're the best thing that ever happened to me,"" he said, taking his two best friends' hands in his broken ones, desperate for Charlie to hear him out. Charlie told him to shut up, but there were tears in his warm brown eyes all the same. ""Luna."" ""I love you and we're fine."" She kissed his broken hand and nodded at the gypsy. Luna took a deep breath when Rolf muttered incoherently about the living will and started slipping away. ""Think of a name, and we'll get some ice cream and some of … blueberry stuff …"" ""Blueberry cobbler,"" Rolf said. He squeezed her hand, completely aware she had no idea what she talked about. Luna nodded, saying something to Charlie, and they shared a laugh. Rolf, slipping away and giving into the sweet relief of unconsciousness, sighed contently when Luna kissed him and did this thing where she ran his fingers through his dark locks. She knew he loved this gesture, and it calmed him, making him breath easier. He'd be just fine no matter what came down the road."
100,2,31,2-Deandra-31.txt,lord-of-the-rings,Deandra,"aware of that. When did such take place?"" Eomer's scowl had deepened, so Lothiriel hesitantly explained, ""It…it was several years ago, Father, when I was visiting Minas Tirith with Aunt Ivriniel. King Eomer was here with his cousin, Prince Theodred."" Her hand fisted in the folds of her skirt, out of sight of onlookers. This was proving as difficult as she had anticipated. ""I see,"" Imrahil commented, but Eomer had already turned his attention to the man's sons, and was greeting them warmly. Again Imrahil's brow rose. He would never have expected Eomer to behave so, indeed his behavior toward Lothiriel was almost rude. After a moment, Imrahil set aside his concern over it; likely Eomer was exhausted from his travel, and distressed by the reason for it. He would be more the man Imrahil knew and liked once this was all in the past. He followed the young king along the line as he greeted others, and they slowly made their way to join Gondor's king and queen. Once he was past, Lothiriel sat as quickly as was appropriate. A glance up gave her a glimpse of her aunt, smiling approvingly at her conduct, and apparently totally unware of the turmoil raging inside her niece. Giving a small sigh, Lothiriel sipped at the wine that the servants were beginning to pour and let the talk nearby draw her in. Despite everything, however, Lothiriel could not keep from sneaking glances at Eomer. Doing so afforded her nothing, though, as he never seemed to look in her direction or take any further notice of her. Just as Erglass had indicated, Eomer had the full interest of every unattached woman in the room, and Lothiriel caught even a few of the married ones eyeing him. When the meal ended and the guests stood around talking and mingling, Eomer was soon surrounded by eager women, anxious to catch his notice. That alone was irksome to Lothiriel, who felt she must keep her distance, but the worst part of it was how pleased he seemed to be to accommodate them. It was quite evident he had well and truly forgotten his professions of love to her, and he most certainly had not been pining over her loss. It put a bitter taste in her mouth, even as she admitted she full well deserved to be treated thus. To her chagrin, her brother Erchirion seemed intent on bringing the two of them together, and despite her protests, he caught her elbow and propelled her toward the golden-haired king. Likely no one but Lothiriel noticed him stiffen when he caught a glimpse of her approaching. He politely turned to acknowledge them, though he kept his eyes on Erchirion, barely glancing at her. Feeling awkward standing there in silence, she ventured conversation by telling him, ""I was very sorry to learn of your uncle's death, and Theodred's as well. You have my condolences."" The words brought a resounding silence from all gathered, and Lothiriel paled, realizing that perhaps that had not been the best topic at just this moment. Eomer's jaw had tightened, but he quietly answered, ""Thank you. That is very kind of you."" He paused an instant, then glanced around at the group attending him and announced, ""If you will all excuse me. It has been a very long day and we depart early. I believe I will call it a night."" He sketched a bow at the collective gathering, and they responded in kind, though clearly the ladies were loath for him to depart. Sadly, Lothiriel watched him stride over to farewell the royals of Gondor and her father before exiting. It had perhaps been foolish of her, but she had hoped that they might at least be friendly toward one another. She had dared hope he might have forgiven her for the folly of her youth, but clearly forgiveness was not forefront in his mind where she was concerned. Erchirion made no comment, though he watched her curiously from the corner of his eye. Neither she nor Eomer had mentioned their previous acquaintance, but he could discern nothing in their behavior to suggest it had been a cordial association. He bit back a grin; Aunt Ivriniel had her work cut out for her if she hoped to marry his sister off to Rohan's king, as he had little doubt she intended.

From the first bite, there was no doubting that the boys were enjoying this special treat, and Eomer couldn't really deny finding it pleasing as well. Each wanted a second apple, so they repeated the exercise, and then cleaned the site and settled down to relax and talk until they were ready to turn in. It took some time for the boys to calm enough to actually stop their giggling and whispers, and finally go to sleep, but Eomer found it most pleasing to have his son curled up beside him, Freawine tangled with the lad as though they were two puppies in a litter. Come the morning, Eomer was up early while the boys still slept. When at length they rose, it was to find Eomer cooking a rabbit over the fire. Their eyes went wide at the sight. ""Papa! Where did you get that?"" Elfwine demanded. ""What? You do not think me a good enough hunter to catch such a thing for our breakfast?"" Eomer teased, and watched the two boys struggling with how this was possible in the Golden Hall. ""Papa!"" Elfwine finally exclaimed in exasperation. ""How did you do it?"" ""I am a man of many talents!"" Eomer laughed, ""And you can continue to ask questions, or you can just sit down and help me eat this rabbit!"" Deciding to forego their curiosity, the boys shrugged and settled by the fire, holding out their plates when Eomer had removed the rabbit and begun cutting meat for each of them. This final day of their camping was spent much like the previous had been. More firewood was collected, and water fetched to the site (the stream having produced a few more buckets during the night). Races were run, stories told, weapons practice engaged in, and all three had a fine time in one another's company. It was with a bit of sadness that they settled in for the night, knowing that tomorrow they would have to 'go home'. Still, for an outing they had thought must be cancelled, it had been most enjoyable for all of them. Laying in the dark, Elfwine snuggled closer to Eomer and whispered, ""Papa?"" ""Yes, Elfwine?"" ""Thank you. I liked being on this campout with you,"" the boy told him sincerely. ""I enjoyed it also, son. And when the weather is better, we will make another attempt at it – this time truly in the out of doors,"" Eomer promised. Elfwine grinned and gave him a hug, before closing his eyes and quickly falling to sleep. xxx When the blanket was raised, reintroducing the trio to the main Hall, Lothiriel was waiting where she had left them, smiling a welcome. ""You are returned! Did you have an enjoyable outing?"" she inquired. ""Oh, yes, Mama! Papa even caught a rabbit for breakfast!"" As Elfwine continued to bubble over with an excited recitation of their activities, Lothiriel raised a surprised eyebrow at her husband. A rabbit? She would be interested to learn how he had managed that, though she could almost bet that Eothain figured in the tale somewhere. The two boys ran off to play in Elfwine's room, as the rain continued and it was still not desirable to spend time outside as yet. It was clear they would be discussing their adventure for a long time to come. Lothiriel strolled with Eomer as he made his way to his study, where they were soon joined by Gamling. His friend and doorward gave the king a grin. ""You enjoyed yourself, then, my lord?"" ""Most definitely, Gamling! Not so good as an actual campout, to be sure, but agreeable nonetheless,"" Eomer replied. Reluctantly, Gamling asked, ""Shall I begin having the Hall restored to its usual design now?"" Eomer rubbed his chin and then shook his head. ""No, not yet."" At the curious looks he was getting from both Gamling and his wife, he quietly explained, ""There were many who ventured forth in the rough weather, to gather what we needed to create our forest encampment. They did it because I am the king and wished it, but also because they desired to enable me to spend time with my son. They did not deem the discomfort too much of a sacrifice. What little sacrifice is it for me, in return, to leave the forest of Meduseld standing a few days more, that any who wish might also enjoy time there with their sons?"" He looked up and grinned. ""Perhaps even you will want a day or two with Freawine!"" Gamling smiled his understanding, and moved to the door. ""I will make it known among the Riders, and arrange a schedule so it does not get too crowded."" With a bow to excuse himself, he exited, and Lothiriel turned to press a kiss to her husband's temple. ""Eadig! Truly you are, my love, but so is the Riddermark that you are their king. We, all of us, are blessed,"" she whispered sincerely. Eomer let out a long, contented sigh and closed his eyes. Aye…eadig! THE END 4/6/08 – 4/8/08 Elfwine is not quite 7 and Freawine is 8.

102,2,2,2-Deandra-2.txt,lord-of-the-rings,Deandra,"me, and pulled her into my embrace. If she was alarmed, she gave no indication of it. Her posture was perhaps tense for an instant, but then she melted against my chest and wept freely, as though flood waters long held back had suddenly been loosed. I was not consciously aware of what I was saying, but I believe I murmured soothing words as one hand cupped her head, and the other rubbed her back, until at length the storm passed and she stilled, save for an occasional hiccup or sniffle. And still we did not move apart. Having taken this step, I was committed to it, however long she required it of me. I wondered, somewhat, at the strength of my conviction to aid Lothiriel's recovery. I could not say why exactly it mattered so much to me, though perhaps it had to do with a sense of obligation to her father. Imrahil had rescued Eowyn when she appeared lost; now was my opportunity to repay the debt. At that thought, my arms tightened around her, holding her safe. At length, her composure slowly began to return, and along with it came a measure of embarassment for her show of emotion. Avoiding my eyes, she murmured strickenly, ""I am so very sorry, my lord. Please forgive me!"" Quietly, I replied, ""There is no need. Such sorrow must be expressed or it will fester inside, and you will not heal."" I very much hoped she would not question how I had learned that truth. At this moment, I did not feel up to relating the experiences which had led me to such an understanding, but I knew it to be true all the same. For a moment, she did not respond, but eventually nodded slowly in acceptance, then began to pull free of my embrace. Reluctantly I allowed her to do so, not entirely sure she should withdraw so quickly and, surprisingly, feeling a bit bereft with the loss of her warmth. We stood in silence, not meeting one another's gaze, both of us rather disconcerted by what had just been shared between us. ""Your…your guard will wonder if we do not return soon. He cannot see us here."" She was gazing back toward where Walda had settled on some rocks, and I turned to follow her glance, though I did not doubt her words. ""He is not the nervous sort. He will not be alarmed unless we are absent far longer than this,"" I murmured in answer. Then, flicking a look back out over the sea, I sighed and asked, ""What was it you saw that…affected you?"" She gave me a stiff smile. ""My mother loved the sea. Father sometimes teased her that she was not truly a woman, but a sprite come up out of the depths to seduce a mortal man!"" At the look of surprise on my face, she laughed. ""Do not be so amazed! Though you know the Prince and the warrior, there is much more to Imrahil of Dol Amroth! She loved him so! Whenever he would accuse her thus, she merely replied that she would gladly forsake the sea if it meant spending the rest of her days at his side. I think…I think she just did not expect those days to be so few."" Her face fell again, as more tears slid down her cheeks, and I reached out to grip her shoulder supportively. ""None of us knows the length of our days,"" I commented, ""but it sounds to me as though she made the most of what she was given."" She brushed at the tears still trickling from her eyes, but she smiled determinedly up at me. ""Aye! Aye, she did!"" We stood in silence, side by side, staring out to sea, and then almost without my noticing, she began strolling back the way we had come, steering a course to safer ground. The lady might have been flustered by my friendly attentions to her, but you could not discern it in her bearing. She had recovered her composure and continued on as though moments before she had not stood wrapped in my arms as she wept. I suppose I should not have found that unexpected, considering she was the daughter of a prince, but I was not convinced the storm had passed and her troubles had ended. I would continue watching until I truly believed she had turned the corner on her grief. TBC Sirrin – ""river queen"" Walda - from weald - ""power"" FYI: There are some distances given between locations for LOTR, but not all. I'm figuring it took about 4 days for the trip from Dol Amroth to Minas Tirith by boat, and the Riders traveling overland took about 9 days. So having set out 6 days before Eomer did, they arrived the day before he did. (and thanks to Lady Bluejay for giving me a more realistic reckoning of the travel time by boat) For this particular scenario, you'll have to assume the Fourth Age started in Sep, 3021 rather than in March as I usually have it. Shire Reckoning fixed the beginning of the Fourth Age to coincide with Frodo sailing to the Undying Lands in Sept. rather than the March reckoning Gondor tended to use. Tuilérë Spring holiday. Tuilere was a day between the months of March and April. It did not belong to either month. Tuilere and the autumn holiday Yaviere were added to the Revised Calendar of the Stewards' Reckoning created by Mardil in 2060. The Stewards' Reckoning was used in Gondor and other places where the Common Speech was spoken, but not in the Shire. The colour of deepest mourning among medieval European queens was white rather than black. This tradition survived in Spain until the end of the fifteenth century, and was again practiced by the Spanish-born Belgian Queen Fabiola of King Baudouin's funeral. It was the custom for the Queens of France to wear deuil blanc or ""white mourning""."
103,2,44,2-Deandra-44.txt,lord-of-the-rings,Deandra,"with agitation at his silence. Finally, in desperation, he blurted out, ""I would have you for my wife!"" Appalled, he stared at her. That was not at all how he had intended to do things. It wasn't gentle or romantic or any of the things women liked. Why would any woman agree to such a demand! Slowly she stood, staring at him in astonishment, and having to tilt her head back to see his face once she was standing. For several moments, their eyes were locked and neither spoke a word. Then, blushing furiously red, she moved forward and slipped her arms around his waist, hugging him tightly as she laid her head on his chest. ""I would like that,"" she murmured. For an instant, Eothain stood frozen in place, not entirely sure he hadn't imagined her response. At length, though, comprehension took over and he wrapped her in his arms. ""Yes?"" he whispered. Turning a tearful face up to him, she laughed. ""Yes!"" He didn't remember moving, but suddenly he was kissing her with a passion so strong she had to cling to him for support. When finally he released her, she was gulping for breath, but her eyes shone with both love and humor. Unable to think of words to express her feelings, she just slipped into his arms once more and again laid her head on his chest. Thus it happened that Zimraphel did not return from her 'errands' for another hour. The boys had been released for the remainder of the day, so the queen was no longer in the main hall. They found her, however, when Eothain carried the bundles to Lothiriel's bedchamber for Zimraphel. At the sight of her, the girl's face froze in concern and she quickly turned away, busying herself with unwrapping the purchases. Eothain was oblivious to the sudden change in her demeanor, throwing the queen an impish grin before he kissed the girl goodbye and told her he would see her at supper. When the two women were alone, Lothiriel asked quietly, ""Zimraphel?"" She pressed no further, and the girl timidly turned to face her, not meeting her gaze. ""Speak,"" the queen instructed. Mournfully, the girl looked up at her. ""Eothain, he...he has asked me to marry him, my lady. But, perhaps I am not at liberty to do so."" Her voice had trailed to a whisper by the time she got it all out. Shaking her head, Lothiriel moved over and swept the girl into her arms. ""Of course you are at liberty to do so! I do not own you, and I would never deny you happiness. We will discuss the particulars and find a solution for each of us, but if you wish to marry that big oaf, then I shall do everything in my power to see it done! And you will be a beautiful bride and have a lovely wedding, make no mistake about it!"" Zimraphel could not hold back the tears of relief and gratitude that flooded through her, and it occurred to Lothiriel just how alone the poor girl must feel with no surviving family. Well, she would not let her suffer for that. They would be her family and see this done right. And so it was that a maidservant from Gondor, who had been in the queen's employ for less than a year, found herself being wed in the Golden Hall. She was wearing a dress that the queen had helped her sew, she was given on the arm of the king's Doorward and there was a feast held afterward for all of the staff of Meduseld and anyone of the town who cared to attend. It would be difficult to say which looked most terrified on their wedding day – the shy, blushing bride or the middle-aged groom who was wondering what on earth he was getting himself into. But when they were finally bound as husband and wife, and sealed their vows with a kiss, the fear seemed to disappear. The queen had little doubt it would be a big adjustment for the both of them, but she also knew they both would work hard at making it turn out right. THE END 1/29/06 – 2/8/06 A/N2: This could get confusing, so I thought I ought to mention it. Because I have done so many variations on how E/L met and got together, you have seen quite a bit of Eothain. In all versions of my stories, his character/personality are essentially the same. HOWEVER, the No Mistake/Elfwine Chronicles series has seen little of Eothain. He really only appears to any appreciable extent in ""You Want What?"". Many of the things you ""remember"" happening between him and Eomer or Lothiriel are NOT in this series. In case you can't tell, if Eothain were a dog, I see him as being a cross between a Labrador and a Doberman. Most of the time he is this big, lovable, affable pooch, but get him riled and he can be deadly dangerous. Mentally, I rather imagine him as being a big bruiser of a man, rather like Sean Bean as Boromir. He can be physically intimidating without saying a word.

At least he thought so until he caught Eowyn watching him with a speculative eyebrow raised. After supper, Sirrin had planned various games for entertainment, and Eomer found himself partnered with Lothiriel for checkers. While both chess and checkers were popular in the Mark, he had never much cared for chess. Though the need for strategizing appealed to him, the game moved too slowly and he usually grew restless in short order. With its faster pace, Eomer had quickly become quite adept at checkers, making use of his skill at battle strategies to plan his moves. However, Lothiriel proved very much his equal, and he enjoyed the challenge. At home, he found it difficult to find a player who could keep him on his toes so well as she did. ""How is it that you are so good at this?"" he asked as they set up the board for a new game, Lothiriel having just won the one they were playing. She laughed. ""When you have only brothers, you quickly learn that all games are competition and if you do not keep up you will be run over! I had to be good enough to hold my own against them. Elphir is the best, though he prefers chess, but I am a good match for the other two. Mother also, so usually it was the four of us playing checkers in the evening while Elphir and Father played chess."" He grinned in response. ""You are right! Games in the Mark can become quite cutthroat. I think most there enjoy checkers far more than chess. It is too sedate to suit our temperaments!"" ""I shall need to learn though,"" she admitted. ""Lord Gaerost prefers chess, and rarely chooses to play checkers. I suppose I must get used to defeat on a regular basis."" The mention of her betrothed put a damper on his enthusiasm that the easy familiarity of their interaction had brought. Though they continued talking, telling of their lives, he found himself holding back, fearing he would overstep some boundary that should not be crossed. If she noticed his reticence, she did not comment on it. Even as much as Eomer's head told him he should avoid close contact with the lady, it seemed he constantly was finding himself in her company. There were times when he could almost believe she was attracted to him, but then he reined in his thoughts. What did it matter if she was? She would not break her betrothal, and he would not attempt to steal another man's woman. Had they met sooner, before she accepted Gaerost, possibly they could have been together, but now that would never happen. Eowyn continued to watch him, and the day before they left Minas Tirith to return home, she came to his room. Looking on as he packed his few meager belongings, she finally broached the subject on her mind. ""Do I sense…something between you and Lothiriel, Brother? You seem eager to share her company."" Eomer paused only slightly in what he was doing, not turning to look at her. Finally, he told her firmly, ""Lady Lothiriel is betrothed to Lord Gaerost. End of discussion, Eowyn."" She knew him too well to pursue the matter, though he was sure she could read between the lines. Without further comment, she moved forward and slipped her arms around him, pressing her cheek against his back. She held him in silence for several moments, and then stepped back. ""I will see you at supper. This is my last day with Faramir and I intend to make the most of it,"" she told him. He turned to smile encouragingly at her. ""You do that. I am sorry you must return with me, and that he cannot join us, but there is nothing to be done for it. We must prepare things for Theoden's funeral, and arrange for your official betrothing."" ""I know,"" she acknowledged, then tossed him a grin before departing. Eomer stood staring at the closed door for several moments before resuming his packing. Whether Eowyn liked it or not, so far as he was concerned, the sooner he left Minas Tirith the better it would be. xxx Imrahil's family had turned out to bid the Rohirrim farewell, but Eomer was able to keep a tolerable distance from Lothiriel so that nothing would seem amiss in their interaction. He had been a little surprised that she had come at all, making the walk up two levels to where they were gathering outside the Citadel. Making sure to display no preference for her company over anyone else's, he and Eowyn were soon mounted and making their way slowly down through the city. He did not notice the curious sidelong glances Eowyn cast in his direction initially, before finally turning her attention elsewhere. She understood why he could not pursue Lothiriel, as she was certain he wished, but it troubled her that he so clearly cared for the woman. It was good to be going home though. That so many wounded men were traveling in their midst slowed the trek somewhat, but still there was an excitement at returning to homeland and loved ones. Not until they reached the damaged walls of the Rammas Echor did Eomer allow himself a glance back at the White City. The past four months had been unbelievable – from the moment three men sprung up from the grass of Rohan, until he found himself facing the Black Gate, and down to seeing the crowning of Gondor's king after so very long without one. Turning his face back to the west, Eomer fixed his gaze on the horizon and signaled the company onward. There would be time in the evenings to dwell upon all that had taken place this year, but for now the Mark beckoned and there was much work to be done. TBC Gaerost – ""sea fortress"" Iorlin – ""old song"""

""I suspect that Lothiriel will wish to care for our children as often as she may do so, but likely a nurse will be needed to assist her so she may have time for her duties as queen. I would hope to participate as frequently as time will allow me to. As for Lothiriel taking care of me in addition to the children, I do not believe I could prevent her from it no matter how hard I tried. She can be most determined!"" Another snort. ""Obstinate, is more like it! Head strong! Lovely girl, our Lothiriel. Had to be strong to survive living with all those men, and no mother to show her the way. Did you want something to eat? Most folks eat about now. I do not much care for meals at midday, but it is an established practice, so people expect it, you know."" ""You did invite us to dinner, Aunt,"" Lothiriel interjected, finally rejoining their conversation. ""Did I? Must have been bowing to social pressure. Silly waste of time and food, if you ask me. A few cups of tea and some biscuits tides a person over until supper. Ah well, if I invited you, I had best make good."" She had bounded up from her chair once more and shuffled quickly to the doorway. This time Eomer was prepared when she bellowed out, ""Food! Bring us food!"" Once more she returned to her chair as though nothing odd had just occurred, and Eomer snuck a glance at his wife, who merely grinned in response. Almost instantly, the same servant shuffled in with a full tray, and began laying it out on the small table near the window. The cats, having finished their cream, hastened to explore what new delights were being made available. The servant was ready for them, however, and the first dish he uncovered held a large bowl of minced fish. Instantly, he had their full attention as he led them back to the hearth and portioned it out in the numerous dishes. While he did thus, Lothiriel set to dishing up plates of food for her and Eomer. He was a little surprised when she did not even offer to do the same for her aunt, but after that discourse on dinner, he supposed it was pointless, and likely Lothiriel knew what was best. In spite of Ivriniel's view on eating meals at midday, the dinner was actually quite tasty. Eomer wasn't sure he recognized everything he had been served, but he could ask Lothiriel about it later. Possibly it was local delicacies that they did not have in Rohan. Ivriniel silently watched them eat, and Eomer was grateful that she wasn't going to make him attempt to talk around mouthfuls of food. The instant he swallowed the last bite, however, she started up again. ""Have the Rohirrim settled that nasty business with the Dunlendings yet?"" He blinked in astonishment at the question. He wasn't sure what had been more startling, that this seemingly housebound old woman knew of that dispute or that she was inquiring about it. ""Do not look so surprised, boy! One does not have to leave their house to know what is going on in the land. I stay on top of things, you may be sure."" He was quite sure she did. Eomer suspected she perhaps knew more than a good many others who should know such things. Drawing his focus back to her question, he answered, ""Yes, for the most part. There may still be some lingering resentment of our past troubles, but when we defeated them at Helm's Deep and then treated them mercifully, they swore an oath to never again wage war against us. They even sent an ambassador to Gondor – this November past."" It felt odd having such a discussion with an elderly noblewoman, but if that interested her, so be it. Ivriniel nodded. ""Good. There has been enough killing, and you would never find that peace you seek if that old wound could not be healed."" Abruptly, Ivriniel stood. ""Time for my nap. I will see you children later, perhaps."" Eomer and Lothiriel instantly rose as well. Once more, Ivriniel advanced on Eomer, coming to stand in front of him, again almost touching. Peering up into his face, there was a long pause, and then she smiled approvingly. ""I like you, boy! Welcome to the family!"" She disappeared out the door, shuffling determinedly down the hall, and never looking back. For several long moments, nothing was said as Lothiriel moved to link her arm with her husband's. Then he murmured softly, a grin twitching at his mouth, ""I like you, also, Aunt Ivriniel!"" THE END 2/10/08 FYI: Ivriniel was born in 2947. She was the eldest child of Prince Adrahil of Dol Amroth. She would be 73 here. This is only a few months into Eomer and Lothiriel's marriage, and follows the stories ""Advance"" and ""Reason"", though it does not particularly tie to those stories. This story does make reference to events that took place in ""By the Book"" and ""No Mistake: Redux"", prior to Eomer and Lothiriel's marriage.

106,2,16,2-Deandra-16.txt,lord-of-the-rings,Deandra,"enjoyment of the occasion so long as he provided food and an excuse to gather. The thought made her smile in amusement. Gondor, and Dol Amroth as well, would be horrified at so casual an attitude toward such assemblies. They took their socializing far too seriously to leave anything to chance! With a sigh, she sipped the hot tea the servant had brought and rose to give a few final instructions. There still was time to lie down for an hour before she had to dress, and between a nap and the tea, hopefully the headache would be gone before she must face her guests. xxxxx As Eomer stepped into the parlor, and all eyes turned toward him, he felt his entire body tense. He knew Imrahil meant well by this gathering, and he had kept it small and probably about as informal as Dol Amroth got, but still he would much have preferred just a quiet supper with Imrahil's family. He had learned there would be no dancing, which was something of a mixed blessing. Not having to dance with every eligible woman in the room was a good thing, but he also would not have the opportunity to use Lothiriel as an escape when the conversation got too tedious. He had often made use of Eowyn in that way, catching her eye and claiming a dance as he apologetically slipped away from some windbag who was droning on endlessly about anything and everything. He suspected Lothiriel would have readily fallen in with his plans and aided him however she could, but that avenue was not going to be available to him. The only thing working in his favor was that Gondor had a strict code of behavior that required the guests to leave at some defined point, rather than lingering until they passed out from drink as often occurred in Rohan. A servant was passing with a tray of wine goblets and Eomer procured one, taking a large gulp and then a deep breath as he plastered on a smile and began his dutiful greeting of the assemblage. The longer the socializing went on, the more he realized how hungry he was, and he sincerely hoped his stomach would not embarrass him with some rude sound. To his relief, a few moments later the guests were summoned to the table, and were being shown to their seats. Apparently there was a rather rigid arrangement to the seating, even at 'informal' gatherings, and he watched the protocol dance unfolding before him until a hand touched his arm. Glancing down, he found Lothiriel at his elbow. ""This way, my lord,"" she said quietly, her right hand motioning in the direction she wished him to go. Though her face was impassive and a slight smile graced her lips, it was the look in her eyes that caught his notice. He had the distinct impression she knew his reaction to all of this, and found it quite amusing. He suspected the evening would be far more pleasant if he were able to sit and talk with the lady, but to his disappointment, she took a seat several chairs down the table from where he sat. However, he had been placed at the head of the table, with Imrahil on one side and Elphir on the other. That did provide something of a cushion against the nobles who were no doubt eager to catch his ear. Imrahil was flanked on his left by Erchirion and Amrothos, while Elphir was seated next to his wife and then Lothiriel next to her. Elphir's infant had been colicky earlier so this was the first opportunity Eomer had had to meet his wife. The night unfolded pretty much as both Eomer and Lothiriel had expected it would in each of their respective cases. Eomer was soon bored with the constant chatter about political and economic matters, and Lothiriel's hunch had proven correct about the subject of gossip in the ladies' group. A couple of times she had to choke back her laughter at some of the women. Several made unguarded comments which hinted more than a little that rather than secure the king for their daughters, they wouldn't mind having him for themselves! While she could sympathize with their admiration for his physical looks, she very much wondered if they would find life in Rohan nearly so appealing as they found the king. From what Eomer had told her earlier about his homeland, things were far different there. These ladies were used to living lives of leisure and excess. Rohan seemed to be a more practical and simple place, where even royal women contributed their efforts in getting things done. Life to the north appeared decidedly dissimilar to anything with which Gondor was familiar. As Eomer had noted, at a certain point there seemed to be an almost unspoken agreement to end the evening. He was not entirely clear how it was accomplished, but he didn't really care either. Just so long as the people left and he could relax, things would be fine. Imrahil and two of his sons gathered for a nightcap, and Eomer joined them. Elphir, his wife Alcathir and Lothiriel all excused themselves and headed off to bed, and Eomer's eyes followed Lothiriel as she climbed the stairs. When she was out of sight, he moved to join his hosts. Amrothos handed him a goblet of wine as Imrahil told him, ""Not the most enjoyable of evenings for you, I am sure, Eomer, but I hope not too tedious. And it was necessary to set the wheels in motion for you with regard to the trade agreements. These men were the ones you will most likely need to interact with in that regard. However, with our departure in a sennight, this should be the only official gathering you will have to endure. Now you may turn your attention to rest and relaxation."" ""Hear, hear!"" Erchirion seconded, and the four of them laughed together."
107,2,3,2-Deandra-3.txt,lord-of-the-rings,Deandra,"you! I truly thought it was the only way to save you!"" ""I know, I know,"" she soothed, stroking his head comfortingly, and pulling him closer into her embrace. Elfwine quietly shut the door the remainder of the way, and slowly undressed, pondering what he had witnessed. Could he have been mistaken? He lay awake quite a while considering the matter, but weariness finally overtook him and he slept. The next morning, breakfast was a somber affair as the family ate in silence. The events of the previous day were still fresh in everyone's minds, and no one knew how to broach the hurtful subject. At length, Lothiriel took a deep breath and plunged in. This had to be put to rest. ""Elfwine, in a battle situation, it is sometimes necessary to do things in what may appear to be a heartless manner. But warriors must make decisions, based on their skill and experience, about how best to accomplish their goal. Newer soldiers do not always understand the wisdom of their more seasoned leaders, but they have to trust them to know what they are doing. And you must trust your father to know what he was doing when he acted yesterday."" Elfwine had thought much about what he had seen and heard yesterday and last night. He found it difficult to believe that his mother was deceived, but still… Struggling to come to grips with this, he asked, ""But why?"" He didn't elaborate, but Eomer seemed to understand the question and spoke for the first time. ""Once you were free, the only pawn they had was your mother. If they believed we cared about her, they would use her to keep us at bay and control the situation. They could have prolonged it for days, with us not daring to act for fear of her being harmed. And in the meantime, they could have… hurt her…without killing her."" His eyes flicked to Lothiriel, and she reached a hand over to grasp his. Swallowing hard he continued, ""But if they believed we did not care about her, they would have no reason to keep her as a shield or a weapon against us. My words were intended to convince them we cared not, so they would cast her aside and fight or run, particularly once we attacked them. And that is what they did. Your mother knew I did not mean my words, and so did all she could to watch and help us in our efforts. She slumped to the ground as added encouragement for the one holding her to give her up and flee. Once she was free, she looked for me to come to her aid, as she knew I would."" Elfwine pondered this explanation. It did seem to make a certain sense, but how could his father say those things if he didn't mean them. As if reading his thoughts, Eomer told him, ""I said it because I had to, son. I would do whatever is necessary to protect your mother, even if it means saying things I do not truly mean…or dying."" A wave of shame swept through Elfwine and tears sprang to his eyes. He wrestled with his emotions for a moment, his head bowed, and then sprang up from his seat and rushed to his father. Flinging his arms around Eomer's neck, he sobbed, ""I am sorry, Papa! I do not hate you! I did not mean it either!"" The iron fist gripping his heart in an icy stranglehold finally eased, and relief flooded through Eomer. Clutching the boy to him, Eomer wept also. Lothiriel, too, wiped at her eyes, pleased the matter was resolved in a positive manner. As their emotion subsided, Eomer pulled back to look in his son's eyes, one hand on the side of the boy's head. ""Know this, Elfwine, I love your mother and you and Theodwyn more than anything else in this world. You may be certain of that, no matter what anyone says to the contrary, including me. I will take that love with me to my grave."" Elfwine nodded convulsively, and hugged his father again, before finally returning to his seat. After staring at his food a moment, he glanced up and announced, ""And I will never doubt you again, Papa! Someday, hopefully, I will be as wise a soldier as you are."" Eomer smiled sadly, and answered, ""I hope you learn from my knowledge, but I hope you never have to gain it from personal experience. My wisdom came at a very high price."" His words were sobering, but Lothiriel saw no reason to linger on this subject longer. Turning their attention to other things, she inquired about what had been happening in Edoras during their absence, and after a time, her husband began to tell them the news. Elfwine joined in with tales of their travels and visit with the relatives in Dol Amroth, and gradually the family wandered back to a happier atmosphere. But in her heart, Lothiriel knew Eomer would never forget these two days, and likely neither would Elfwine.

They were not satisfied with this answer, but it was the best Gamling could give them, and they had no other choice but to do so. Even Elfhelm and Eothain, who had been close friends of the king prior to this, were turned away when they came to visit. They and Gamling shared dark looks over the situation, but none spoke of their greatest concern – that the king would never come to terms with this or return to the throne. As men, and warriors, it was not that they were unsympathetic to Eomer's circumstances. In truth, they were uncomfortably aware that, but for the grace of the Valar, it might be one of them facing this nightmare. But the most pressing need was to find a way to help Eomer cope, and they felt inadequate to that task. xxxxx Prince Imrahil was surprised when it was announced that his nephew, Faramir, had arrived to see him. There had been no dispatch advising of an impending visit, and he found that curious. Faramir strode quickly into the room, and just by his grave countenance, Imrahil knew this was not merely a social call. ""Uncle, I must speak with you and Lothiriel at once,"" he announced without preamble. Imrahil nodded and signaled to the servant, ""Would you find my daughter and send her to me?"" The servant bowed and exited to his task. When they were alone, Imrahil gave Faramir a questioning look and his nephew told him, ""I will wait to go into detail once Lothiriel is here, but it concerns Eomer and it is not good news. She will likely need our support in this."" Again Imrahil nodded, though trepidation flooded through him. He had thought Lothiriel and Eomer had finally found happiness with each other. He very much hoped this was only a passing matter that could be overcome, for he did not wish to see either suffer. A few moments later, Lothiriel joined them and Faramir took her hands as he sat down beside her. He thought for a moment how best to phrase his message, then finally pulled out a letter from his pocket and handed it to her to read. When she was done, she passed it to her father and sat staring at the floor. Once Imrahil looked up from reading, Faramir said, ""I am sure Eomer is upset by this injury and not thinking clearly. Eowyn would go to Edoras if she could, but the baby is not old enough to travel such a distance yet. Despite his not wanting you told about this, Lothiriel, I think you should go to him. He needs you there, whether he realizes it or not."" Both her father and cousin watched her closely to see her reaction. At last she pulled her gaze from the floor and rose. ""If an escort can be ready on the morrow, I will be prepared to depart first thing in the morning."" Her father stood and moved to embrace her. ""I will arrange for it. And when Amrothos returns from Minas Tirith, I will send him along to join you."" He kissed her forehead and she gave him a watery smile. ""I will be all right, Father. Do not worry about me."" She pulled free from his arms and stepped to her cousin. Giving him a hug, she said softly, ""Thank you for letting me know, Faramir. And thank Eowyn for ignoring his wishes in the matter. Assure her I will take good care of him for her."" Faramir kissed her head as well, ""She already knows you will. That is why she wanted you to be told."" Lothiriel moved slowly from the room, but with each step her stride became firmer and brisker, and she raced up the stairs to her bedchamber. Quickly she began pulling out clothing for the trip and told her maid-servant, ""Fetch bags for me to pack in – not trunks. I want to travel as light as possible so as to shorten the journey."" The servant nodded and hastily exited. When she returned with the requested bags, they set about packing the belongings that were laid out on the bed. Within little over an hour, all was packed that could be today. A few last minute items would be added in the morning before their departure. And then Lothiriel was left alone to her thoughts. The implications of Eomer's paralysis were not lost on her. A king was supposed to lead his men into battle, when necessary, and was also expected to produce an heir. Both of those activities were in jeopardy by this injury. And for a man, especially a warrior, that would be a difficult thing to accept. She tried to envision life with a man who could not walk or do many of the things a husband normally would, but it was difficult to picture Eomer in that setting. He was so robust and full of life that it seemed impossible anything could keep him down. And she was not the only one affected. How would the people of Rohan react? Would they want a different king who was not so impaired? If Eomer stepped down, then Eowyn would be the natural replacement, but would she and Faramir wish to give up their new home and titles and responsibilities in Gondor? Undoubtedly, Eowyn would not leave her country to fend for itself, but it would not be an easy decision for them to make. Lothiriel had always loved children, and hoped to have many of her own. Could she let go of that dream without causing Eomer to feel as if he had failed her? Question after question chased through her mind, but few solid answers manifested themselves. The only thing she was certain of was her love for Eomer, and her determination to do all she could to get them both through this experience without it driving them apart."

Generally, her father made it a point not to discuss military matters in front of her, not wanting to frighten or alarm her, but occasionally she wandered in on such. She was used to them curtailing their conversation when she appeared, but now Imrahil and his sons turned to look at her. She could not quite read the expression in their eyes or on their faces, but it made her uneasy. She had caught the word 'departure' as she was entering and she feared bad news was coming. Even so, not until supper was ended and the servants had cleared away all but their tea did Imrahil venture to enlighten her. She was rather surprised when he bid her remain, and something in her mother's countenance set her stomach churning with agitation. All eyes were on Imrahil. Though her brothers likely knew what he would say, and possibly even her mother did also, it was expected he would be the one to voice it for Lothiriel's benefit. With a sigh, he began. ""I have tried not to worry you, dearest, with the difficulties we face, but now it cannot be avoided. The threat of Mordor grows daily and Denethor has requested we come. Your brothers and I will depart two days hence, to take the Swan Knights and an army of seven hundred to aid Minas Tirith's defense. Elphir will remain here with you and your mother, to assist in the rule of the City and to oversee the protection of Dol Amroth. I do not expect our city to come under attack, for I think the Dark Lord will focus all his efforts on destroying Minas Tirith first, but if the White City falls, then it is only a matter of time before the rest of Gondor crumbles as well."" Lothiriel wondered how she could still be conscious when it seemed as though she had stopped breathing. Regardless of what she had imagined, this was far worse than expected. Her father continued, ""I confess, I had hoped Mithrandir's prediction regarding you all those years ago might have signaled a brighter future than this for all of us, but it seems it is not to be. Be strong, my beloved child, and do all you can to help your mother and brother protect our people. And whatever else, know how very much I love you."" All eyes were on her, and she wondered what they expected her to do or say. Swallowing hard, she spoke the first words that came to mind. ""Safe journey, Father. May the Valar watch over you and see you safely home to us."" None were fooled by her benign response, but there was nothing that could be said to reassure her that all would be well. They could not be certain if things would be well, and there was a very strong possibility that they would not all sit at the same table again once this was ended. ""Is…is there anything you wish me to do to help you prepare?"" Lothiriel managed to croak out, in a voice that sounded nothing like her own. Realizing it might help her to be useful, Imrahil suggested, ""Your mother will assist me, but perhaps you will help Erchirion and Amrothos ready themselves. We must travel quick and light, so there will be no room for finery. Time is of the essence."" After that, no one seemed to know what more to say, but none was willing to be the first to break their circle and leave the table. They lingered for nearly half an hour, sipping at their tea and talking quietly. At length, Imrahil decisively rose to set things in motion, and the family followed his lead. Lothiriel watched silently as her parents left the dining chamber arm in arm. Although she was used to seeing them walking thus, now her mother seemed almost to cling to her father's arm, as though wanting to hold him close to her. Amrothos' teasing voice broke her reverie, and she jumped slightly as he caught her by the waist. ""Come. You can help me decide what to pack. Let Erchirion fend for himself!"" Erchirion made a face at the two of them, but allowed them to exit the room without commenting. The pair had always been close, since Amrothos was nearest to Lothiriel in age, and likely it would help her most to spend some time with him. xx Two days later, at dawn, the family gathered in the yard below the palace steps. Lothiriel's face was drawn and tired, not having slept well. Her tears were long since shed. She had clung to Amrothos and sobbed that night Imrahil made the announcement, and it was very late before progress was made toward packing any of his belongings. She had wept into her pillow as well, though she had tried to make sure she was not heard. Now, as she watched the final preparations, she felt totally depleted, as though there was no moisture left in her body to come forth. Even her mouth felt dry as dust, and she swallowed several times in an attempt to relieve it. At last the moment came for the final hugs, and kisses pressed to forehead or cheek. Imrahil and Sirrin tightly held each other for several long minutes before stepping resolutely away from one another. Without speaking, Imrahil turned and stepped up into the saddle, and his sons followed suit. Elphir and Lothiriel moved in closer beside their mother, each linking an arm with her. With a final nod to his family, Imrahil signaled the troop forward and they slowly filed out of the yard. The three stood in silence and watched until they exited the gate at the bottom of the long sweeping drive out of the palace grounds.

I do not know how long it will be before we make our way north. Perhaps after we have seen all we wish to in the south, we will make use of the Anduin for the journey."" ""I...I hope you enjoy your travels. If you...I should be very pleased to hear from you on what you encounter. It all sounds very exciting."" Theodred's eyebrows twitched at her comment; then he realized she was hinting for him to write to her. He shrugged. ""I do not know how easily I may send letters, but perhaps I can find a way to send one. If not, I will tell you about my travels in person when I come."" That seemed to satisfy her and she looked quite happy with the situation, even though her father was calling to her to board the boat. Final farewells were said and Theodred watched as the boarding planks were removed, lines cast off and the boat moved away. With a last wave from Theodred and Freahelm, the two returned to their horses. They were quickly mounted and on their way. They had been riding some time before Freahelm broke the silence. ""So, do I detect an interest in Kata?"" Theodred chuckled. ""She is a sweet child, my friend. Nothing more."" ""Child? Theodred, the girl has just entered her eighteenth year – that means she is only two years younger than you! She is no child!"" ""She is very young for her age. I grant you she is charming and friendly, and very lovely, but she is still a child. I think there is a greater chance of something between you and Fritha than between me and her sister!"" Freahelm gave a snort, answering, ""I am the son of a soldier, and a soldier myself. I do not think it likely she is looking to be courted by such. And even if she is, her father is not apt to desire it."" ""Freahelm, they are less rigid in Dale. Surely you saw that. Do not underestimate your chances. If you like the girl, make some effort in wooing her."" ""Yes, I shall do that – from Dol Amroth..."" Freahelm commented sarcastically. ""All right!"" Theodred laughed. ""You make a valid point. Woo her when we go to visit, then."" After a moment, Freahelm encouraged, ""And you ought to give her sister greater consideration. I think there is more there than you presently acknowledge. And judging by the way she looks at you, I doubt very much she would object to your attentions."" ""Perhaps. I will keep it in mind when next I see her."" TBC 4-23-06 Explanatory Note: Overland it is about 50 miles from Minas Tirith to Cair Andros. A person on horseback can probably cover 30-40 miles/day so it would take about 2 days. However, if there are wagons and such, the speed drops to about 15 miles per day, meaning it would take 3-4 days. I have assumed that since it is more than 40 years after the War, once the danger was past of nasties of Mordor, a road was built from Ithilien to Dale along the east side of Mirkwood (Eryn Lasgalen). It followed the North Road until that road split off to the east toward Mordor. A new road was built continuing on North and that is the route the Dale visitors are taking. Since it is a very long overland journey, they are sparing their horses that extra 50 miles. When they arrived, they left their wagons and such in a new port established at Cair Andros and sailed to Minas Tirith from there. They are returning to Cair Andros via the Anduin to pick up their wagons and continue on home. In a later chapter, when Theodred and Freahelm go to Dale, they do not take that road, which would have been the easiest, most direct route. Instead, they elect to follow the western shore of the Anduin since they are interested in visiting historical sites along the way. From my examination of everything I could find about the Anduin, I am convinced that the Anduin is not particularly ""boatable"" from about Cair Andros to the Falls of Rauros. Then farther north, the Undeeps make it difficult boating as well, except perhaps for smaller craft. Thus, when Theodred and Freahelm return home, they sail down the Anduin til they reach the Limlight River and then strike overland across Rohan. The Undeeps begin near that point. Wasn't sure how to name the folks from Dale, but in checking Thain's Book online I found that the known names seem to be Old Norse. I tracked down a website that gives Old Norse names and tried to come up with some that sounded like they fit in Middle-earth. (My apologies to Tolkien and anyone else who knows more about this than I do.) from Old Norse: Gird - meaning is uncertain; Fritha - ""beloved""; Kata - ""cheerful""; Darf - ""bold, brave"" End note: It is not essential that you read the Elfwine Chronicles in the order they were written, but there is an advantage to doing so.

111,2,15,2-Deandra-15.txt,lord-of-the-rings,Deandra,"worry about than you !"" For just a moment, Esgalmir felt guilty, but then she pushed it aside. Anbarad got what he deserved if he was too weak-willed to stand up for himself. She knew Eothain could be imposing, but he would not force her brother to do anything, though Anbarad might be convinced he had no choice. That was his own problem, however. Catching Theodred's arm, she suggested, ""Walk with me? I am desperately in need of moonlight, and kisses from a certain someone!"" Snickering, Theodred rose, pulling her to her feet. ""See, there you go being inappropriate again! And, for some reason, I do not mind in the slightest!"" xxxxx Unbeknownst to Esgalmir, the couple's friends had assessed the situation with her brother and determined to intervene. The next day at break of fast, with Anbarad looking a bit worse for the wear after all he'd had to drink the previous night, Eomer announced that it was traditional for the men of the betrothed pair's families to go off on a boar hunt to keep them out from under foot. Though Anbarad had no desire to climb on a horse or hunt boar, with both kings and the Steward participating, he could hardly refuse, so he steeled himself for a miserable day. Esgalmir fought to hide her amusement, knowing full well that her brother rarely rode and thus would likely be very sore at day's end. Still, she could not complain at having him out of her hair for a good long while. His wife, though annoying, usually left her alone when Anbarad was not around. But the family apparently was leaving nothing to chance, for moments after Eomer's announcement to Anbarad, Lothiriel proclaimed the traditional tapestry weaving would take place in her sitting room just after breakfast. Quirking an eyebrow, Esgalmir gazed at the queen, who gave her a wink when no one was looking. As Lothiriel explained it, the ladies of the family were to participate, though the bride herself was exempt since it was a gift to her. Eowyn was looking a bit less than thrilled by this turn of events, having endured this woman for the entire journey from Gondor, but she was given reprieve when Lothiriel suggested that perhaps Eowyn would be so kind as to keep an eye on the children while they worked. Lothiriel was able to keep Esgalmir's sister-in-law occupied the greater portion of the day, and the woman was too intimidated by the queen to say much. Without her husband around, she was much quieter, and therefore less irksome, so the other ladies did not find their gathering unbearable. When the men returned late in the afternoon, it was clear that all but Anbarad had enjoyed the outing. He looked thoroughly miserable, but determined to appear noble before his king. As soon as he could discreetly do so, he excused himself to his chambers to wash, and his wife hurried off to attend him. The men had not encountered any boar on their jaunt, but then they were not truly intending to do so. Not wishing to risk injury to anyone, Eothain had led them on a carefully planned route that kept all safe, but was rigorous enough to be a challenge to them. Virtually everyone but Anbarad took the difficulties in stride. To no one's surprise, he begged off joining them that evening, claiming he felt unwell, and he and his wife dined in their room. As a result, the remainder of the wedding party had a much more enjoyable time at their gathering.

It was more likely in earlier times that couples agreed to marry, with consent of the bride's nearest male relative and barring public opposition. There might not even be any sort of formal 'event' in recognition of the decision and final accomplishment. As this is Middle-earth, however, it does not necessarily follow any particular practice found in history, and so there is room for creativity on the part of the fanfic author. The weddings I have previously portrayed in my stories have varied as to content, but mostly dealt with royal weddings, which I envision as being far more complicated than those of the average person. As this story includes a lower class wedding, I tried to bring it closer to the historical standard, while still including embellishments of my own devising.

I cannot change the fact that you do not carry my blood in your veins, but I will always bear love for you in my heart. I swear it."" The small boy drew back and wiped at his face, pondering this for a moment, then nodded his acceptance. He could not expect more than that. Throwing his arms around Theomund's neck, he hugged him tightly, ""I will always love you, too, Papa."" xx Eomer moved to seat himself at the desk in his study, then looked at the small group gathered there. Theomund had asked for certain people specifically to join them: Eomer, Lothiriel, Elfwine and Eomer's two Chief Advisers. With Theomund were Fele, Frideswide, Eledher and Haldred. ""So, Theomund, what is this all about?"" Eomer asked. ""My lord,"" he formally phrased, ""I have a matter to bring up that is largely a family matter, but may have some points that require counsel from your Advisers. I wish to name Eledher as my lawful heir, with all the rights and privileges that attend that position."" Eomer blinked in surprise, not expecting this, but Lothiriel smiled. The two Advisers were momentarily stunned, and then broke into frantic whispering between the two of them. Finally, Eomer raised a hand to silence the two men and asked, ""You are certain about this? You have thought it through carefully?"" ""Yes, Father. I love him as dearly as if he were flesh of my flesh. It is merely a formality, but I would have all know the esteem he is held in our family and in my heart. I would have him responsible for my land and property, for my family, should anything happen to me. I will be responsible for explaining this to Haldred as he grows older so he understands why I chose to do this."" ""My lord,"" one Adviser ventured, ""he is not of the house of Eorl..."" Eomer caught the implication and nodded. Turning back to Theomund and his family, he signaled to Eledher to come to him. When the boy came forward, he lifted him up into his lap. ""Eledher, do you know what the house of Eorl is?"" When the boy shook his head no, Eomer continued, ""It is the blood line of the kings of Rohan. Each of the kings has been from that line for generations. Normally it comes down through the male line, from son to son, but on occasion it comes down through the female line through a daughter, as it did with me, when no sons are living to rule. When I die, Elfwine will be the next king of Rohan, and after him will come Arawine. But that assumes that everything goes the way that it should. If something very unusual were to happen, it is possible that the kingship might come to Theomund instead, and that eventually it could fall to one of Theomund's sons to rule Rohan. All of Theomund's sons would be of the blood line of the house of Eorl – all of them except for you. As king of Rohan, I can make you Theomund's lawful heir, but I cannot make you of the blood line of Eorl, and so I cannot make it possible for you to rule Rohan. Do you see that?"" Eledher thought for a moment and then nodded. Eomer added, ""It does not mean that I or Theomund does not love you, but that is simply something that we cannot give you, and the law says that you must have it if you are to rule Rohan. So, I will grant what Theomund asks – I will make you Theomund's lawful heir, with the one exception that you will not be his heir to the throne of Rohan. Haldred will retain that right, should it ever become necessary."" With that Eomer kissed the boy's head, and grinned at his son. ""You do like to keep an old man on his toes, do you not? Do you lie awake at night thinking of new and interesting ways to challenge me?"" All in the room broke up with laughter, save Eledher, who did not understand what was said, and the Advisers who did not have much of a sense of humor to begin with. There was a side benefit to the whole matter, however. Theomund was now more aware of what he was doing, and realized that his excessive focus on his new son had been misconstrued by Eledher. He was more careful to include Eledher and not appear to show favorites, thus allowing Fele more time to enjoy her new baby, which suited the new mother just fine. THE END 7-4-06 Eledher is 6-7 A/N2: I haven't done a story about it, but Gamling began relinquishing his duties and training his replacement in May, 44 IV. Since Eomer has been absent more and more frequently, and turning more and more responsibility over to Elfwine, he left it to his son to select the new Doorward. Elfwine chose Brandir, son of Eothain, to be his Doorward. At this point, Gamling is still around, but Brandir largely does the footwork while Gamling mostly just advises him.

He did not notice that Theodwyn had been standing nearby, having come to claim him for their dance, nor did he realize she had witnessed the full exchange with Tamwen and Feladyrne. Scowling in resentment of the way he had been treated, she spun on her heel and charged through the crowd in search of Elfwine. Elfwine had just gotten Dariel seated comfortably in a chair where she could watch the proceedings. She was in her seventh month of pregnancy and not always at ease, but she participated in activities as long as she could before she was forced to retire for the evening. Just as Elfwine straightened, Theodwyn charged up and caught him by the arm to drag him away for a private conversation. Dariel shook her head in amusement, by now quite used to Theodwyn's blunt manner. ""Theodwyn, what is it?"" Elfwine asked, freeing his arm from her grasp. Pacing angrily in front of him, she animatedly relayed what had taken place, then demanded, ""What are we to do?"" Older and wiser, Elfwine better understood the situation and told her firmly, ""Nothing."" As she began to protest, he stopped her with a raised hand. ""Theodwyn, this is not something you can fix. I will go talk to Caffola, but anything you might do to try and help would only make things worse. Please, just be his friend, but do not interfere."" He reached out and stroked her head soothingly at the frustrated look in her eyes. ""I know it is difficult, and I want to help Caffola, too, but we must tread lightly. Love is not something outsiders should meddle in."" ""But he–"" she began to protest, only to be interrupted. ""No 'buts', Theodwyn."" He pressed a kiss to her forehead. ""Trust me on this. Although it is difficult to see Caffola be hurt, there is only so much we can do without hurting him more."" Reluctantly, she backed down, crossing her arms in annoyance at the injustice of it all. ""Do not fret, dearest,"" Elfwine reassured. ""I will go do what I can."" With a sigh, he moved toward the exit she had indicated Caffola had used, and followed the other young man out into the darkness. It was not difficult to locate his friend, for he had not gone far and was sitting on a bench, staring out into the night. Elfwine took a seat beside Caffola, remaining silent for awhile. At length, he asked, ""Will you not fight for her?"" ""She has made her choice,"" Caffola answered dully. ""Of course she would want someone with more to offer than I ever could."" ""Stop it!"" Elfwine snapped and Caffola looked up, blinking in surprise at his tone. ""I will not allow you to sit here and wallow in self-pity. You are a good man, you have an honorable occupation, you are a hard worker and have a pleasing disposition. Feladyrne can offer her nothing more or better than you can."" He paused a moment and then added, ""And I am not convinced he offers her as much as you do."" ""What do you mean?"" Caffola asked hesitantly. ""I do not think he loves her. I think…I have seen men like him before. I think he toys with her for his own pleasure, and will ill use her, then cast her aside. If you truly love her, you would not let her suffer such a fate."" ""Have you learned something?"" Caffola questioned, demandingly. ""If so, I would hear it!"" ""No,"" Elfwine sighed, ""nothing has been said to raise my suspicions. It is just a feeling I have – the way he carries himself, and the way I have seen him act with other women."" Caffola shook his head disbelievingly. ""You are my friend, and you think you see things that are not there because you want me to be happy. Everyone speaks well of Feladyrne, and even with my own eyes I can find no complaint with his behavior."" Elfwine let out a growl of frustration with his friend's stubbornness, and rose. ""I am not wrong. I am sure he will prove his true colors all too soon. And Tamwen will be the one to suffer for your blindness."" He turned and strode quickly into Meduseld, his irritation evident in his movements. Caffola dropped his head into his hands. For just an instant, he entertained the notion Elfwine had planted in his mind, but then he forced it aside. It was wishful thinking that Feladyrne had evil designs on Tamwen. She would not accept his attentions if he were a bad person. He sat on the bench long into the night, his mind awhirl with many thoughts, but nothing to offer him hope. He would have to plan a future without Tamwen at his side.

Wisely, Lothiriel had focused her efforts using horse-related words, which spurred his interest all the more. Elfwine joined them for dinner, and had enough time before he had to go back to accompany Caffola to the stables and let him take an apple to Mithlig. Caffola would have gladly whiled away the afternoon in the barn, but Lothiriel had made it clear that she expected him back at the Golden Hall for more lessons. So, parting ways, he trudged back to Meduseld while Elfwine returned to the training field. The next sennight followed much the same pattern and, by the end of the week, Caffola could read and write a few simple things. On days when training ended early, Elfwine would either show him around town, or they would get an escort and go riding for a while. Caffola had not asked, but Elfwine knew he would prefer not riding Mithlig, who was getting on in years, so he provided another horse for him, and Mithlig was allowed to get his exercise in a paddock without the burden of a rider on his back. Even so, Caffola faithfully visited him daily to curry him and give him a treat. Things had settled into such a familiar pattern, that it rather jolted Caffola when the king called him into his study one evening, along with Elfwine and Lothiriel. He had become comfortable here, but it now occurred to him that this was not his family and likely he could not stay with them forever. Somehow, he was certain the king was bringing them together to discuss his future. Once everyone was seated, Caffola nervously eyed the king. He had always liked and admired King Eomer, since the first moment they had met when Caffola was only six years of age. Now the king's eyes came to rest upon him and he found it difficult to hold the man's gaze. ""Caffola, while we have enjoyed having you stay with us, I have been considering your situation and I believe I have come up with a plan that you will find agreeable."" Caffola's eyes flicked up questioningly, now unable to look away from the king while he waited to hear his fate. ""I have talked to Byldan, who oversees my herds and raises my horses for me. He has agreed for you to come stay with him, and he will teach you what you need to know to work alongside him. His family is grown and gone from home, so it will be possible for you to live with him while you are there."" Eomer's glance twitched to his wife and he added with a grin, ""And his wife has agreed to continue the boy's studies in the evenings!"" Lothiriel smiled approvingly at her husband, but made no comment. Caffola sat silently for several minutes then, staring at his hands, he clarified, ""You are sending me away?"" ""No, I am not. I am sending you where you can learn what you truly wish to know – all there is to know about horses. You will be able to care for them and ride them all the day long. Does that sound like a punishment to you?"" Eomer asked with a grin. Ruefully, Caffola shook his head. ""No, my lord…I just…I will miss all of you greatly."" Eomer smiled at the earnest sentiment; the boy had always been quite forward in his dealings with his king so it was hardly surprising he still continued to be so. ""And we will miss you, but we will see you several times a year. My herd is kept in the Folde, so it is nearby, and Byldan comes to Edoras regularly to keep me abreast of how things are going and bring in new horses."" Caffola hesitated, but then asked, ""What about later, when I am sixteen? Will I come back to Edoras and join an eored then?"" Despite the question, there was a notable lack of eagerness in the inquiry, which Eomer readily noted. ""We will see about that when the time comes. It may be that you will prefer to continue working with the herds instead, but if you would rather be a Rider, we will let you try."" There was another long pause, and then Caffola asked, ""What about Mithlig?"" ""Mithlig will go with you and live out his days on the grasslands, rather than cooped up in a barn all the time. And I believe he will be happier if you are nearby to bring him treats!"" Eomer assured the boy, and was rewarded with a dazzling grin in response. For several moments, Caffola sat digesting all this information. Then, abruptly, he was up out of his chair and had rushed to the king, flinging his arms around him in a tight hug. ""Thank you, my lord!"" Smiling, over Caffola's shoulder at his wife and son, he returned the embrace as he murmured, ""You are very welcome, young horse master.""

Goodnights were said to the others, and then Arwen led the way to the library for their conversation. The queen serenely stood by the fireplace, gazing into the flames for a moment, then said quietly, ""There are those who put much stock in 'luck', but I am not among them. I am a great believer in making one's own luck. Therefore, it will not surprise you much, I think, that I do not hold with the notion that it is 'bad luck' for a bride and groom to see one another before their wedding."" She turned to eye Luthiel pointedly. ""In fact, I believe there are instances when such a meeting might be essential to future 'luck'."" Luthiel's brow furrowed at her comments; it was evident the queen thought she needed to see Eldarion. ""Is there…something I should know?"" she asked, a bit fearfully. ""Nothing dreadful,"" Arwen gently assured her, ""only that my brash son is feeling a bit beleaguered of late, and is perhaps in need of a special someone's tender touch."" With an enigmatic smile for the girl standing before her, the Elf-woman glided toward the door, adding over her shoulder, ""I have found he often retreats upon the Tower when he is troubled."" Luthiel remained pondering her words for several moments after she was gone. For the past week, she and Eldarion had not been allowed to spend time alone together. Only group gatherings, such as tonight's supper, permitted them any time in one another's company. Taking a deep breath, she turned toward the door. She had never much held with the notion of luck either and, if Eldarion needed her, she did not intend to let superstitions interfere. She had only been up on the Tower two or three times in her life, but it was not difficult to find her way. There were strategically placed lamps, that were kept lit from dusk until midnight, though admittedly the great Tower had a rather eerie feeling to it in the darkness of night when she was alone. ""Eldarion?"" she called, her eyes probing the blackness in an attempt to locate him, as she stepped through the stone doorway from the stairs. The torches here flickered in the wind, and the moon, though nearly full, was largely hidden behind the storm clouds. There was no response to her call, but a movement to her right drew her focus there, and at last her eyes adjusted enough to make out Eldarion's form, slumped dejectedly against the chest-high wall around the perimeter of the tower. Quietly, she moved over to join him, leaning on the wall next to him. Though he did not speak, she could feel the tension in him, even without their touching; his mother was right – something was definitely wrong. With a soft sigh, she turned to face him, and reached a hand over to his cheek bringing his face around toward her, though he kept his eyes lowered and did not meet her gaze. ""What troubles you?"" she asked gently. After several moments, he pulled away from her to stare back out over the Pelennor below them. Letting out a ragged breath, he murmured mournfully, ""I wanted everything to be perfect for you, but it has all gone amiss. The harder I try to make it special, the more it all falls apart. I am sorry, my love. I have failed you."" Luthiel's thoughts raced as she tried to discern what he was talking about, in order to form a response. Then a flash of insight struck her, and she asked, ""Do you mean the wedding plans?"" He nodded disconsolately, then railed, ""The weather keeps our guests away and has ruined the flowers, after nearly thirty years of relative peace the Haradrim choose now to stir up trouble, and your betrothed looks as though he has been in a tavern brawl! What more can go wrong? We do still have a few hours yet for further mayhem to manifest itself!"" Ah, so that was it! Eldarion, who always did everything perfectly, was frustrated by his failure to accomplish perfection now. She could not help finding it all slightly amusing, but clearly he had taken the situation to heart and was quite tormented by all that had gone wrong. ""Eldarion,"" she told him tenderly, ""look at me."" She waited, and finally he did as she bid, turning to face her though he didn't meet her gaze. Reaching out a hand, she lifted his chin, forcing his eyes to follow, until they were looking into one another's eyes. ""I do not need guests or flowers to make my wedding day perfect, and the Haradrim would do well not to try and come between me and my betrothed! I am the daughter of a shieldmaiden; I will take them on personally if they attempt to deprive me of you!"" Her words elicited a laugh that he could not quite stifle. ""And, as to your appearance, my love, I have seen you bruised and bloody before, though usually it was my doing that caused it. I doubt this will be the last time I will see you thus."" She leaned closer and brought her lips within a hair's breadth of his to whisper, ""Just think of all the pleasure that can be had as I nurse you back to health!"" With a groan, he pulled her against him and hungrily kissed her. When they paused to catch their breath, Eldarion could only hold her in silence. No words would ever express what he was feeling. He could only hope she understood without his speaking of it. As if in confirmation, she tilted her head to look up at him in the brief shaft of moonlight that had revealed itself. Her eyes spoke volumes to him, and he reclaimed her lips in appreciation of what he read there."
116,2,17,2-Deandra-17.txt,lord-of-the-rings,Deandra,"kiss to his lips, again caressing his face. ""That is all I ask. I only want your memories of her to be fond and not so crushing."" Lothiriel was not surprised when Eomer had another restless night, and was gone before she awoke. Her hand smoothed across the sheets on his side of the bed, hoping today dawned brighter for him. xx ""My lord! Welcome!"" The tavern-keeper bustled toward him. ""Would you care for something to drink?"" Eomer paused, but then nodded. ""Ale."" It was a bit early for drinking, but he needed something to occupy his hands, and suddenly his throat felt very dry. A swift glance around showed few in the tavern so soon before noon, but there were a couple of men at one table in the farthest corner who eyed him curiously. The only other person sat drinking alone, his back to Eomer. After ten years, certainly Eomer could not recognize the man from behind, if he ever could, but his instinct told him this was who he sought. Just as the ale was handed to him, a craggy voice called out, ""Have you come to imprison me, Eomer, now that it is within your power? Or are you here to kill me, as you always wanted to do? Surely none would question the king taking a life."" There was bitterness in his tone, but also a recklessness. Eomer realized that Cuthburg did not much care if Eomer was going to kill him. Perhaps Lothiriel was right; perhaps he felt he deserved death. ""What would imprisonment or death accomplish?"" he asked walking closer, and moving around so he could see Cuthburg's face. He almost gasped at the change of ten years. Indeed, it looked more as though a span twice that had passed. He could not think that time alone had so ravaged the man's countenance. Cuthburg lifted his eyes to stare at Eomer, and almost unwillingly the king found himself searching for answers there. He did not like what he saw – the heavy burden of guilt, far worse even than what he had suffered when he thought he had failed Eowyn. Thiri was right; nothing Eomer could say or do would wound this man any more than he was already hurt. He drew out a chair and sat down across from Cuthburg, taking a sip of his ale while gathering his thoughts. Finally, with a sigh, he said what he knew must be said, no matter how difficult it was for him. ""I was wrong to blame you. You did not deserve that. Only now do I see clearly and realize that Breguswith chose to act as she did, and you would have done anything, even to the giving of your own life, to prevent it."" The man's brow knit with surprise. ""You have changed, Eomer,"" he observed quietly. ""Aye, I have. Long years of war does that to a man. And, I have found a good woman who helps me see my mistakes and correct them if I can."" Cuthburg swallowed some of his ale, spilling a little on the table as he set the mug down with a thump. ""A good woman is worth more than gold. Cling to her."" Before Eomer could respond to that, he added, ""Fegerwif left me, you know. Her grief was too great at the death of her only child. She took sick and died in less than a year."" Eomer let out a ragged breath. ""I am sorry for your loss. I always liked Fegerwif. She was very kind to me…as were you."" A tear trickled from Cuthburg's eye, but he paid it no heed. ""That was a long time ago."" ""Not so long. The War is ended and there is peace in our land. Shall there also be peace between us? I think…I think Breguswith would wish that. She would not like seeing you in such pain. Despite your different view of things, she did love you dearly."" ""As I loved her!"" Cuthburg gasped, his face dropping on his arms as he wept freely. Eomer realized that perhaps he had never fully grieved for his daughter until now. Sympathetically, he laid a hand on the man's shoulder and remained silent. Eventually the emotion subsided, and Cuthburg swiped at his face with embarrassment. After a moment, he sat up and met Eomer's gaze. ""You have changed, Eomer King, and perhaps if you do not think me a worthless cur, then I do not need to believe it is so."" Eomer nodded. The tension eased, the men drank in silence. At length, Eomer asked, ""Would…would you care to join me for the midday meal, meet my wife and son?"" Cuthburg favored him with a long look and then smiled. ""Yes, I should like that very much."" 11/9/12 – 1/20/13 Cuthburg – ""known protector""; Breguswith – ""strong protector""; Fegerwif – ""pleasant woman"" The events described took place about 3009 III, when Eomer was about 18 or 19. 3002 - Death of Eomer's father Eomund. Soon afterwards, Eomer's mother Theodwyn also dies. 3014 - King Theoden begins to fall under the influence of Saruman's agent Grima Wormtongue. 3017 - Eomer becomes Third Marshal of the Mark.

""Oh, no, my friend, I think not,"" Eothain murmured, dashing around a couple of tents on an intercept course. The man was too busy looking back, to make sure he wasn't being followed, to notice Eothain barreling at him from the shadows. Eothain crashed into him, putting the full weight of his body behind the impact; consequently, his victim went flying, tripped over a tent stake and crashed to the ground, where he lay moaning. Unceremoniously, Eothain grabbed him by the ankle and towed him back to the other captives. Three! He had only seen eight or nine in the brigand's camp. Certainly he had gotten his share! Around him, the fighting was winding down. Ceorl apparently had spread the word about Eothain's victim pile, for the other brigands were being dragged or herded to that location also. Any who were yet breathing were tied securely and a guard set over them. ""Did any get away?"" Eomer asked, joining the group. The men murmured in the negative, and the general consensus was that all had been felled, either by death or injury. Eothain's count had been correct, there were eight of them. Two were dead. The other six would be delivered to King Elessar on their upcoming visit. ""In the morning we will send a message rider to Gondor. I wanted these men captured first so they could not harm the rider. I will attempt to get Lothiriel to provide more information on her family."" Eothain yawned and stretched. ""Well, then, I am off to bed. A good night's work, men!"" Eomer grinned at his retreating form, then turned to the others. ""Six back on guard duty around the camp. Two watch this lot. If they are not cooperative, kill them."" He made sure to speak in Westron to let any captives not unconscious know of his instructions. ""And good night to the rest of you. Well done."" Eothain had not gone straight back to the tent. Eomer found him at the opening of Lothiriel's tent, conversing with her. ""It is quite done, my lady. You need fear them no longer. They will be returned to Gondor for punishment – those that survived."" In the moonlight, Eomer could see tears glinting in her eyes, and her voice was husky as she replied, ""Thank you, Eothain. And please thank the others also. I am glad no one was hurt of your men. I will sleep easier now. Good night."" She glimpsed Eomer as she was turning back into the tent, and gave a silent dip of her head in acknowledgement. A part of Eomer knew that he should have been the one to offer her reassurance, but Eothain's relaxed manner meant the captain was more comfortable establishing friendships with people, especially women. Most of Eomer's life had been focused on warfare, and there had been little inclination and even less attention paid to social graces. That would have to change now that he was king; leading his men in battle would still be necessary on occasion, but there were other demands also. The Eorlingas looked to him to wed and provide an heir to carry on the line of Eorl. He could not hope to accomplish that if he remained just a dour military commander. With a sigh, he followed Eothain into the tent. It had been a long night after a full day. Rest was what he needed most just now.

While it is true that Aragorn and company made that trip at need, even with the Dead being gone, discussions with Certh and further reading lead me to conclude it is not a viable route on a casual basis. Parts are steep and difficult to traverse, and even Gimli who was used to the darkness underground commented on how very dark it was through the mountain passage. Neither did the horses want to go into the tunnel and had to be persuaded. I will not attempt to go back and correct earlier stories that have made use of this route, and that includes in the Elfwine Chronicles – for continuity sake, it will remain a possible route.

118,2,6,2-Deandra-6.txt,lord-of-the-rings,Deandra,"totally engulfed in flames, and Fele's roof was burning. Like a madman, he raced toward the door, screaming for her, ""Fele! Fele!"" He could hear coughing and Eledher was crying. Not bothering to wait, he crashed against the door, bursting it open and fell inside. The smoke stung his eyes, and for a moment he choked before able to get enough air to call again, ""Fele, Eledher – where are you?"" Something flung itself at his knees and it took a moment to realize that it must be Eledher. Scooping the boy up, he called again, ""Fele? Where are you? I have Eledher!"" A sob of relief sounded nearby and he turned to see Fele struggling into a robe and helping her mother toward the door. He followed them out, even as men were beginning to throw water on the flames. Something struck his arm, but he hurried on, not stopping to check it until they were clear of the cottage and he was sure they were all safe. He steered them toward a patch of grass under a tree, where the four of them collapsed on the ground, coughing the smoke out of their lungs. Eledher had calmed just being held by Theomund, and the man turned his attention to the two women. Frideswide seemed unharmed, but in shock as she stared at the burning building. But Fele was sobbing uncontrollably. With a quick kiss to Eledher's head, he handed the boy to his grandmother and then reached over to pull Fele close, wrapping her in a strong embrace. Silently he held her as she wept. It was some time before the sobs eased, and just as they did, Renward approached. ""Theomund, two of the cottages were destroyed, and a third is damaged severely, but no lives were lost."" Struggling for composure, Theomund nodded, then instructed, ""Gather those who lost their homes. I am sure there will be room for them at Meduseld until other arrangements can be made."" His eyes turned relentlessly to take in the smoldering buildings, flames still evident as the men fought to completely extinguish the fire. Not wanting to let go of Fele, Theomund awkwardly got to his feet, pulling her with him, and then helped Frideswide to stand. Knowing the boy was too heavy for her to manage up the hill to the Golden Hall, he handed her daughter over to her and took the child in his arms. The other families were gathering nearby, and he led the sad processional up the street. Already, men were coming down the hill, having been alerted. Eothain was in his shirtsleeves, and stopped to speak with Theomund as he was lacing his breeches. Theomund filled him in on what had happened, then instructed, ""Set a guard for the night, please, Eothain. They do not possess much, but I would not want anything that survived to be lost to looters."" The older man nodded, gripping his shoulder in consolation before moving on down the hill with a few riders. Meduseld was abuzz, and Theomund was not surprised to find his parents waiting and two healers present. Once the families had been checked for injuries, they would be given rooms for the night. Luckily, there were few serious injuries. All of them were still coughing and their eyes burned, but flushing with water had eased that somewhat and fresh air was gradually replacing the smoke in their lungs. Fele had been sitting numbly with her mother and son, awaiting attention. Their cottage had been next to the one that caught fire, so the other family was treated first. As Theomund came to join them, something registered in her clouded mind and she let out a gasp, lurching to her feet. ""Theomund! Your arm!"" He looked down as she reached for his left arm, only then noticing the burned skin of his forearm. In all the confusion, he had forgotten about something striking him. It was now apparent it had been something that was aflame. He winced as she tried to gently ease his shirt from the wound and Frideswide rose, calling to the queen, ""My lady! Come quickly! A healer is needed for your son!"" In an instant, Lothiriel was at their side, examining Theomund's arm as she pressed him down on a bench. Now that he was aware of the injury, the pain of it was beginning to seep in past the adrenalin that had concealed it until now. Wearily he rested his head on his clenched fist, trying to keep the pain at bay while the healer cleaned it. A cool hand came to rest on his head, and stroked it soothingly. He assumed it was his mother, but when he looked up he found Fele watching him with concern. Grasping her hand, he pressed her palm to his cheek and hoarsely whispered, ""I was afraid I had lost you!"" For once, she did not pull back and simply gave him a gentle smile. ""Shhh! Everyone is safe, thanks to you."" He dropped his eyes. Gratitude. He was sick to death of gratitude. He wanted to hold her and kiss her until his mind was firmly convinced she was unharmed, and then he wanted to continue kissing her until the end of time. If she noticed his despair, she gave no indication and all stood in silence as the healer worked on him. Once the arm was bandaged, Lothiriel instructed, ""Give them your old room, dearest. I will see to the others. And then you should get some rest yourself. Do you want to stay here tonight? If so, Theodred's room is empty for now."" He nodded morosely, saying, ""I will stay."" He did not add that he couldn't bear leaving this little family just yet. 411411411411411 Brythild: brytta – giver, hild – war; ""war giver"" Fealides: fealu – dark, ides – woman; ""dark woman"" Durucwen: duru – door, cwen – woman; ""woman of the door"" Lyfwyn: lyf – air, wyn – delight; ""delightful air"""

By now he was practically bellowing at her, and Lothiriel took a step back from the verbal assault, astonished by its intensity. For several long moments, they stood silently staring at one another, and then Eomer spoke, clearly intending to end the discussion. ""I am the king of Rohan!"" he snarled. ""I may do whatever I choose!"" Lothiriel felt as though she had been slapped, but straightened to her full height. ""Yes, that is true, for Rohan and for yourself. But it does not apply to me. I am sorry, my lord. I stayed here to determine if a marriage alliance might be formed between our lands. I see now that is impossible. I wish to marry a man, not a ruthless warrior. I desire a husband rather than a cold-hearted killer in my bed. I will return to Dol Amroth as soon as possible."" She turned on her heel and walked from the room with as much dignity as she could muster under the circumstances, though her emotions roiled within her. Why had she ever thought this could work? Her father's admiration for the man in battle certainly could not translate to similar feelings were he to see the king as she had here. No, she would return home and be wed to a nobleman there. She might not have love in her union, but at least she would not have fear, and perhaps some semblance of love would come in time. Lothiriel swiped in annoyance at the tears that had trickled from her eyes. Why did it matter so much that this had failed? Nothing was firmly set; no one would think ill of her for choosing not to stay. And, yet, her decision was still painful. She was not without compassion for Eomer. For all the gruff exterior he presented to those around him, she knew there was a great deal of pain underneath, eating away at him. Still, she had tried to get through to him, to help him find healing and he had pushed her away at every turn. What more could she be expected to do? Marry the man and live in this misery with him? No, that would be intolerable. If he was going to destroy himself, she would not stay and watch. Supper that evening was silent and tense. Eowyn could hardly miss the strained manner between Eomer and Lothiriel, but more than that, she glimpsed regret, surprisingly enough in both their eyes. As soon as the meal ended, Eowyn drew Lothiriel to her sitting room to find out what had happened, and the young woman explained about her encounter with the king earlier in the day. Eowyn sighed, rubbing at her temples. ""Is there nothing I might say to persuade you to stay longer, to give him more time?"" she asked. Lothiriel fought back tears and sat down heavily on a chair. ""What good would more time do, Eowyn? He does not want me here, he does not want to get to know me. If I saw any hope that the situation would improve over time, I would gladly give it, but in all these months, nothing has gotten better. If anything, he feels even more distant from me than the day we first met."" Eowyn dropped her head into her hands. ""I know. I am sorry to have even asked. None of this is your fault; I know that. You have done more than your part to make it succeed. I just…I fear for him. Something is dreadfully wrong and I know not how to make it right. He even pushes me away, and never in our entire lives has he done that before. We always had one another when all else failed."" Lothiriel moved over to place a consoling hand on her friend's shoulder. ""I am sorry. I wish there was something I could do to help him, but I do not know what else to try."" After several moments, Eowyn straightened, regaining her composure. ""When will you leave?"" Lothiriel dropped her eyes and fingered the back of the chair. ""It will take a few days to gather my things and get them packed. I hope your brother will not object to sending an escort with me. If he does, then I must send word to my father and wait for him to have someone come to fetch me."" Eowyn rose. ""I will see to it that Eomer cooperates and sends a guard with you. He owes you that much at least. You…you do realize that it will be an unpleasant journey. This time of year is not good for traveling, and there are no inns where you may shelter."" Lothiriel nodded. ""It cannot be helped. I fear if I stay it will only agitate him further. If I cannot ease any of his burdens, I at least do not want to add to them."" TBC from Thain's Book online (www tuckborough net): Father of Eomer and Eowyn. Eomund was descended through many generations from Eofor, the third son of King Brego of Rohan. In 2989, Eomund married Theodwyn, the daughter of King Thengel and sister of King Theoden. Their son Eomer was born in 2991 and their daughter Eowyn was born in 2995. Eomund and his family lived at Aldburg in the Eastfold. Eomund was the chief Marshal of the Mark and was responsible for guarding the eastern marches of Rohan. One of his main concerns was protecting the horses of the Rohirrim against Orc raiders. Eomund was brave and fearless but he was also impulsive, and he often pursued Orcs with insufficient caution and few Riders. In 3002, Eomund followed a band of Orcs into the Emyn Muil, where he was ambushed and killed. Theodwyn became ill and died shortly afterwards, and Eomer and Eowyn were taken in by their uncle, King Theoden. Eomer later became the King of Rohan."

But you can call me Ilbie,"" he blurted. ""Mellor, son of Meneldil, at yours and your family's"" he responded with a smile. ""You are close kin to Sir Meriadoc, are you not?"" He nodded. ""I'm his second cousin once removed, through his great-uncle Saradas, who was my grandfather."" The Ranger grinned at this earnest recital; such kinship among Men would not be reckoned especially close, but among hobbits it most certainly was. ""I am very pleased to meet you, then, Ilbie. So you have been told off to watch me then?"" He shook his head. ""No, I offered. Lots of us wanted a turn to watch you."" Mellor found this frank admission rather disarming. ""I had better let Aunt Esme know you are awake, though, because the healer wants a look at you, and then of course, you need to eat…"" He put down the book he had been holding, and darted to the door, before Mellor could protest that he was not especially hungry. And yet even as he thought this, his stomach growled. ""I'm turning into a hobbit, already,"" he muttered to himself. Hungry or not, the thought of food was not especially appealing with his head still throbbing so. It wasn't long until Ilbie returned, bearing a loaded tray of food, and followed by Mistress Brandybuck and Master Dodinas. Ilbie put the tray down, and Dodinas came over to him, removing the pendulum from his neck. It was the tooth of some sort of animal, suspended from a leather cord -Mellor's eyebrows rose-if he were any judge of such things, that looked like a wolf's tooth! How he wondered, had such a thing come to a hobbit? He watched curiously as the hobbit dangled the pendulum over him. This was not something he had seen before. The hobbit studied the patterns of the swinging pendulum intently. ""You are still in a good deal of pain,"" said the healer. ""I think that I need to increase the willow-bark I have been giving you. And now you need to eat something and build up your strength."" The healer reached a hand down, to assist Mellor to sit up. The hobbit was surprisingly strong. For a moment the room swayed, and Mellor thought he might end up flat on his back again, but after an instant the dizziness passed. Ilbie put the tray down, and Mellor inspected it. There was far more food there than he would have cared to eat even in full health. There was a bowl of porridge, toast and jam, a plate with a mushroom omelet and several sausages, and a pot of tea. But he looked with dismay at the tiny cup and the utensils-they would be awkward in his large hands. Still, with care, he found he could manage them. He ate more than he thought he would-all the porridge and most of the omelet, though he took only a bite or two of toast, and did not touch the sausages. The tea was very good, and sweetened with honey. Each cup was only a couple of swallows. Esmeralda sat next to him, pouring more from the teapot as he finished each cupful. ""I am pleased that you are feeling somewhat better, Master Mellor."" she said ""You will be glad to know that I received the letter of permission from Thain, Master and Mayor just this morning; I expect that the Master, and Merry and Pippin will be in Buckland before the day is out."" Mellor was briefly puzzled, before he recalled that those were the nicknames of Sir Meriadoc and Sir Peregrin. ""Thank you, Mistress Brandybuck. You have been kindness itself."" ""I am glad to be of help to you. We of the Shire have only recently become aware of the debt we owe you Rangers for generations of safety and security. Your people have paid a high price for the protection of ours."" Mellor looked at her earnestly. ""It was our duty, but also our privilege. And it was worth every moment of it, for what your people in the end did for ours. It was, after all, a hobbit, who finally saw accomplished that which even the King Isildur could not do. And all our years of watching and waiting led up to that moment, though we knew it not."" A sad smile came to her face, and for an instant, tears stood in her green eyes. She blinked. ""Frodo. And of course Merry and Pippin and Samwise. It is still hard to understand, but I am beginning to."" xxxxxxx As they dismounted at the Ferry, Merry looked at his father with concern. ""Are you all right, Da?"" Saradoc chuckled wearily. ""I am not so young as I used to be. Riding through the night straight through is something I have not done in many years."" ""Well, you can take it easy now, Uncle Sara, for we're home,"" said Pippin. He turned to his cousin, who had signaled the hobbit on duty across the River to bring the ferry over. ""What will we do next, Merry?"" ""I don't know, Pip. It's going to depend on what this Ranger has to tell us, and how he came to be injured."" Merry was worried. If the Ranger had been injured by violence it could mean a serious problem for the Shire. xxxxxxx Eradan was worried. His partner was supposed to have met him back at their camp, where the road to Sarn Ford met the Greenway. He had not at first worried, for he had returned from his own errand more quickly than he thought-he had caught up to the King's Messenger long before Bree. Still, after three days, he was getting very concerned.

There was creamy carrot soup, and roast beef with mashed parsnips, and warm yeasty rolls of bread, and stuffed mushrooms and several other delights as well. Pudding was an apple crumble, and for filling up the corners there were plates of cheeses, pickles and savoury wafers. Frodo found himself sated long before the filling up of corners stage was reached. He sipped lightly of the excellent elderberry wine that was being served to the adults, and listened politely to the reminiscences of the two elderly hobbitesses. They had been good friends of his mother, and it was a bittersweet pleasure to hear their stories of her youth. For a moment his mind wandered to Pippin, and he swept his eye over that table. His gaze briefly landed on the Banks brothers; he still was half-convinced that Paladin and Eglantine should have been informed of the incident, but he would honour Pippin's wishes in spite of his misgivings. The meal ended, and the hobbits began to leave the pavilion and head out into the now-starlit evening to the sounds of the musicians warming up their instruments for the dancing. Frodo spotted Cado and Clovis. They seemed to be lurking behind one of the poles holding up the pavilion, and he wondered what mischief they might be plotting now. He went over to them, and the guilty expressions they turned to him steeled his resolve to speak to them. ""I know what you did to Pippin in town this afternoon. It was not a joke and it was not funny; do not try to tell me that it was. I will be keeping my eyes open while I am here, and I expect the two of you to give Pippin a wide berth. Do you understand me?"" Clovis gave a sullen nod, and Cado squeaked out a barely audible ""Yes, sir."" Frodo treated them to another moment of his silent gaze, and then giving a satisfied nod, he walked away. An instant later, the two brothers, who were trying to avoid being seen by anyone , saw Pearl coming in their direction. They bolted. The music had started now, and sets of dancers had begun to form in the wide space between the pavilions. The first dance was ""The Happy Hob"", and it was a vigorous and breathless dance. Merry danced with Pimpernel and Pippin with Pervinca. This was followed by ""Circle of Joy"". This was one of Frodo's favorites, and he found himself in the circle between Pearl and another hobbitess he did not know. He partnered Aunt Primrose in ""Exchanges"" and then dropped out of the dancing to just watch. He soon found himself at the mercy of several young hobbits clamoring for a story, so he sat down upon the gnarled root of an old oak tree and began to tell the exciting tale of the Great Eagle Thorondor, and how he had helped the Elf Fingon to rescue his cousin Maedhros from the evil Lord of Angband. He glanced up to notice that Merry and Pippin had joined the crowd of hobbits at his feet. He was getting tired. ""One more story,"" he said. ""Just one!"" ""Tell us one about Gandalf!"" cried Pippin. Frodo thought for a moment, and then grinned, and told the story of Gandalf's first meeting with the Old Took, who was not so very old at the time, and was engaged in a bit of tweenaged mischief for good measure! He left the group of youngsters laughing, and began to make his way to the Smials. He was unsurprised to find Merry and Pippin rushing to catch him up. Merry was probably just as tired as he was—they had both set off early, after all. Pippin seemed to be full of energy, hopping about and running ahead only to stop and watch impatiently. But Frodo was sure that he had to be exhausted as well after such a busy day. They followed Frodo to his room, and Pippin asked ""Can we stay with you tonight, Frodo?"" Frodo was mildly surprised. They had mostly outgrown asking to sleep with him; Merry especially thought he was too old for that now. But he truly did not mind, as it reminded him of when they were younger. Still, they did not have as much time together as they once had now that Frodo was Master of Bag End. He nodded. Merry went to fetch his and Pippin's nightshirts and dressing gowns, and Pippin went into the room with Frodo. ""Thank you for not telling on Cado and Clovis, Frodo. I really think they were just joking. And it would have made Mother so upset!"" ""It was not a funny joke, then, Pippin. They could have hurt you badly."" ""I was a little bit scared,"" he admitted. Frodo knew that if his little cousin was admitting to that much, that he had been far more than a ""little bit"" scared, but he didn't say anything, and Pippin, looking to change the subject, picked up the book that Frodo had unpacked. He looked at it curiously. ""This looks interesting. Would you read some of it to us?"" ""Anything to avoid sleep, Pip?"" Frodo asked with a chuckle. He grinned at Pip's pleading face. ""Yes, you insatiable Took, I will read a little bit of it tonight."" Merry returned with the nightshirts, and soon all three were tucked up in Frodo's bed, the lamp lit and the Moon glowing through the window. ""It was the first day of Halimath in the year 928 when I drove my cart East on the Great Road, heading for Bree with a cartload of Buckland's finest apple brandy and produce from the Marish…"""

The King had forbidden them to join in the search. ""The last thing we need are two more missing hobbits,"" he had said firmly. But he did not look any too patient himself, as he waited to hear the reports of the searchers. Young Bergil had been in and out three times with the messages: no sign of the missing yet. Faramir had gone out and then returned, having made some inquiries of his own among the staff of the Citadel. ""None have seen them today, sire,"" he said, shaking his head. ""You inquired of everyone?"" The Steward nodded, and then stopped, a sudden look of hope on his face. ""No! No, I did not. The Archivist does not live in the Citadel, so I've not spoken to him! But I do remember that Frodo expressed an interest in looking among the ancient records. Would Pippin have gone with him?"" Merry and Sam exchanged a look. ""Yes,"" said Merry, ""if there wasn't anything else to do. He'd want to stay with Frodo."" Faramir stepped to the door. ""Bergil!"" The boy came in. ""Yes, sir?"" ""Do you know where the Archivist lives?"" At the child's nod, Faramir said ""Run and fetch him, then."" xxxxxxx Frodo was fairly sure it was past midnight now. Sam and Merry must be frantic. Pippin's head was in his lap, and as he stroked the chestnut curls, he hummed soothingly, an old Shire melody. It had to be a measure of the pain Pippin was in, that he made no effort to join in. They had driven the rats off three more times. And the first of the lanterns had now burned out. Frodo was anxious, as he noticed the second one began to gutter a little. He didn't think the light would burn till morn-and then they'd not be able to see the rats. In spite of his confident words to Pippin, Frodo began to wonder just how long it would be until they were found. He remembered vividly the frantic search for Pippin, years ago, in similar circumstances. How foolish he'd been to leave no word of where they were going to be! He shifted Pippin's head a bit. If the rats came back he needed a free hand. Suddenly, from the direction of the stairs, they heard a thud, and the groan of hinges-the sound of a door being flung back. ""Frodo! Pippin!"" ""We're here!"" Frodo yelled. ""Down here!"" Pippin sat up with a grin. They could see torches, and hear feet, including rapidly approaching hobbit feet. Merry and Sam burst into the room, followed closely by Aragorn, Faramir, Gandalf, Bergil and the elderly Archivist, who could be heard proclaiming his apologies on the way down. ""I had no idea the pheriannath were still down here…"" Merry and Sam came up to the table, puzzlement on their faces. ""What's happened here?"" Merry asked, looking askance at the toppled bench, and the remains of the broken box. ""We were taking refuge from rats,"" Frodo said, arching a brow, and glancing significantly at Pippin before catching Merry's eye. Merry looked at Pippin, who was grinning at him now. But he understood. ""Shall we get you down from here?"" he asked. ""Just a moment,"" said Aragorn. He walked over and looked at Pippin's red and swollen knee; then he glanced at Frodo's weary and pale face. ""I don't think the two of you need to be doing any walking."" He reached over and took hold of Pippin's knee. Pippin suppressed a gasp of pain. ""You've put a strain on it, but it does not seem that you dislocated it again."" He lifted the young hobbit carefully, and turned, putting him into Faramir's waiting arms. Then he turned to Frodo. ""I'm fine, Aragorn! I can walk."" ""No doubt. But you've had nothing to eat, and you are exhausted. Humor me."" And he scooped Frodo up as well. Gandalf had been looking about the room, and noticed the documents that had been swept to the floor. He picked one of them up, and glancing at it, he turned to look at Frodo. Frodo met his gaze squarely, and nodded. Gandalf rolled it up, and placed it in his robes. Suddenly, Frodo grinned, as he remembered the other document that he still had in his own jacket. Perhaps he'd just hold on to that one a day or so. Faramir looked at Aragorn. ""Should we carry them to the Houses of Healing, sire?"" Both Frodo and Pippin started to protest, but Aragorn shook his head. ""I think they will be better off at the guesthouse."" It was nearly dawn by the time that Frodo and Pippin were tucked up together in the big bed the hobbits shared on the ground floor of the guesthouse. They had been washed and dressed in clean nightshirts, and fussed over. Pippin's knee had been rubbed with salve, and wrapped. Merry and Sam brought them a gigantic tray, with porridge laced with cream, butter and honey, juice, tea and toast-and a couple of the cheese tarts Pippin had spoken of earlier. After Aragorn and Faramir left, Merry and Sam joined them, all of them ready for some sleep. Pippin dozed off quickly, tucked between Merry and Frodo, succumbing to the pain draught Aragorn had given him. Frodo turned his head and dropped a kiss on Pippin's curls, meeting Merry's eyes. His own eyes began to droop, when they flew open once more. He turned to Sam. ""Sam! What did you do with that scroll I had in my jacket?"" ""I put it away in the clothes press with your other things, Mr. Frodo."" ""Good, good,"" he said, getting drowsy once more. ""Pippin wanted to show that to Menelcar. I think he deserves to."" And then he slipped into slumber. xxxxxxx *Reference to my story ""The Brandy Hall Incident"""

Bilbo, astonished at young Sam's presence of mind, handed him his leaf-pouch. Sam put a large pinch onto the wet cloth, and applied it to the swelling. ""It's not a bite, Master Pippin, it's a sting. He stuck his stinger into you."" Pippin had calmed a bit and was just sniffling now. ""The wet pipe-weed will pull the stinger out, and make it feel better,""* said Sam soothingly. ""He's probably very sorry he stung you, Master Pippin. He'll die now he's got no stinger."" ""Oh!"" cried Pippin, and burst into tears again. ""I killed it!"" For the first time since Pippin screamed, Sam looked taken aback, and gave a puzzled look to Bilbo. Bilbo knelt down and gathered Pippin into a hug, careful not to let the handkerchief get loose. ""It's all right, Pippin, that's just the way of things for bees."" ""But what if he has a family?"" Pippin sniffed. ""There are so many bees in his family, and as I am afraid bees are not at all clever about such things, they will not really notice."" ""Oh."" Pippin's sobs began to subside, and he relaxed into Bilbo's embrace, his little thumb finding its way into his mouth. ""It feels better, Sam,"" he murmured. Just then the Gaffer walked up. ""What's all this then?"" he asked. Sam looked up at his father. ""Master Pippin got stung by a bee."" ""Yes,"" said Bilbo, ""and I am most thankful to young Samwise here, for his use of the wet pipe-weed! I had no idea that is what one does for bee-stings! He's a very clever lad!"" Sam blushed at the praise, and the Gaffer looked gratified. ""Well, seems as if that's summat a gardener needs to know, Mr. Bilbo. I've had to do the very same for Sam myself a time or two. Is the little Master feeling better?"" he added to Pippin. Pippin turned his gaze up to the Gaffer's face. ""Uh-huh,"" he nodded. He ducked his face shyly into Bilbo's weskit, and burrowed further into his cousin's embrace. ""I think,"" said Bilbo, ""that it is time to go back inside and prepare lunch. Won't you and Sam join us in the kitchen, Master Hamfast?"" Bilbo asked more out of habit than of expecting an affirmative answer. ""No, and thank you, Mr. Bilbo,"" the gardener answered as he always did. ""The Missus'll have summat fixed for us at Number Three. Come along, Sam. You can finish weeding the border later."" Pippin pulled his thumb from his mouth, and turned his tear-ravaged face up. ""Please, Mr. Gaffer? Mayn't Sam stay? I like him. I could play with him 'till Merry and Frodo get here!"" Hamfast Gamgee gazed at the little Took as if mesmerized, and then, shaking himself out of his daze, said, ""All right. Go along wi' ye, Sam, and do just as Mr. Bilbo says, and keep Master Pippin out'n any more trouble."" Sam gaped at his father in astonishment, and then with a grin said ""Yes, sir!"" After a splendid luncheon, Pippin went back out in the front garden with Sam, who obligingly chased him, squealing, about the garden. Sam had just caught Pippin and was swinging him high overhead, when they heard familiar voices calling from the lane. ""Oh!"" cried Pippin. ""It's Merry and Frodo!"" And scarcely waiting for Sam to set his feet to the ground, he pelted through the gate and barreled into his most-beloved and best cousins. Frodo and Merry, walking amiably up the road to Bag End, and wondering what Bilbo might have for tea, looked up in surprise to see the tiny figure coming at them like an arrow straight to the target, and braced themselves. Pippin slammed into them, hugging them both, and talking a mile a minute. ""Merry! Frodo! I've been waiting for you ever so long! Papa-I mean Father-said I could stay with Cousin Bilbo till you came and I got to play with Sam and I got stinged by a bee and Sam fixed it with pipe-weed and Cousin Bilbo is making seedcake for tea and-"" Merry grabbed his tiny cousin and swung him about, and then pretending to throw him, held him up to Frodo, who, with one smooth move, plopped him atop his shoulders. Pippin squealed in glee, and tangled his fingers in Frodo's dark curls. ""I thought you would never get here! Cousin Bilbo said you went to visit Cousin Fatty but he said you'd be home in time for tea and-"" The cousins came through the gate to Bag End, which Pippin had left swinging open, and Merry shut it carefully behind him. ""Cousin Bilbo wouldn't climb the tree with me he said he is too old Frodo so maybe you will climb with me did you know that weeds can choke flowers? Sam said so-"" Sam stood by the path, grinning and shaking his head. ""Hullo, Merry! Mr. Frodo! I've been keeping him company while Mr. Bilbo makes tea."" ""Father and Mother and Pearl and Pimmie and Vinca are going to be here for supper! Cousin Bilbo says we are having leg of lamb and mint jelly and potatoes and-"" Merry patted Sam's arm sympathetically. Sam glanced up at the little one, who seemingly had yet to run out of breath. ""Does he ever stop talking?"" ""-we have new kittens at the farm Merry maybe you can come see them soon-"" Merry laughed. ""Only when he's asleep, Sam!"" The cousins headed into the smial. ""-can Merry and me sleep with you tonight Frodo? I'd like that ever so-"" And as the green door closed behind them, Sam chuckled, and turned his attention to the flowerbeds. xxxxxxx * Wet tobacco actually is good for insect stings.

124,2,38,2-dreamflower02-38.txt,lord-of-the-rings,dreamflower02,"torment him. He had cuts all over his upper body as well as bruises. When the cuts had failed to produce enough screams, they had spent an evening breaking his fingers one by one. Sometimes he would faint from the pain or the terror. If they'd had enough amusement for the evening, they would leave him be, and he would fall into dark dreams, but always ending with the dream of Folco Boffin. If they had not had enough sport, they would slap him awake, and pour a foul-tasting draught down his throat that burned like fire. It would give him energy, and wake him, and it seemed to sustain him in some horrid way-for they never offered him any food at all. He had no idea of how long his ordeal had lasted. But there had been a day of respite-freezing cold and rainy weather had led them to find an abandoned cot to lie up in. The torment that night had been severe, but the next day, the weather had dried up, and leaving him alone and tied up, the four of them had gone out to forage for food. Ted lay there falling in and out of a hazy drowse, roused from time to time by pain, and thinking the same anguished thoughts over and over again. The look of pity on Frodo Baggins' face kept coming to his mind. Why should Frodo have felt sorry for him? Obviously he must have known what was coming to him. He was feverish, and finally he dropped off into a profound, yet uncomfortable sleep. He was wakened once more by a slap, and some of the horrible draught was poured down his throat. He was too weak to struggle against it as he had been, and merely gagged as the burning liquid scalded its way down his throat. Gash took out his knife, and Ted watched dully as the ruffian played with it in front of his eyes. Then he flinched as the knife was repeatedly prodded in his upper arm. A few days earlier, this would have brought him to screams; now he barely whimpered. ""Looks like our little rat is not so much sport as he was,"" said Gash with a sneer. ""Maybe we should do something a little different."" He approached the fire they had built in the hearth, and lay the end of his knife in the fire. Ted watched apprehensively, a knot of fear as he wondered what new deviltry his tormentor had come up with. He could hear the other three chuckling in anticipation. Gash turned and picked Ted up by the ropes which were wound about his torso, and then quite deliberately lay the hot knife against the hobbit's cheek. Ted's shriek of pain seemed quite satisfying. He held him very close to his face, and brought the knife up again. ""Maybe an eye, this time,"" he chuckled. Ted's terror was suddenly rekindled. In a panic, and with an energy he thought had long abandoned him, he began to struggle as he had not since the beginning. The knife drew closer. With a move borne more out of instinct than anything else, Ted threw his own face forward, and clamped his teeth on Gash's nose, biting so hard that he drew blood. Two things happened. Gash with a horrible yowl, threw Ted from him. Ted flew across the room, landing so hard against the wall of the decaying house that he actually broke through it. Ted spat-the hot acid taste in his mouth nothing like the salty taste of blood. He looked up in surprise at Gash's face staring down, and noticed with a shock that the blood was black. The second thing was his realization that he no longer felt any pain. He couldn't move at all, but the pain was gone. His eyes widened in surprise. Gash grabbed his left arm and snapped it like a twig. Ted looked at it in wonder. The brute looked surprised at his lack of reaction. Krag came over, and stepped on his other arm. Ted didn't feel that either. Harry looked for a moment, and then dispassionately lifted one of his legs and let go. It landed like a log. ""You've gone and broken its back, Gash,"" he said. ""It's not going to be feeling any more pain. Won't be anymore sport from that one."" Gash rubbed his nose, and looked at the black blood on his hand. He reached down and cleaned it off on Ted's breeches. ""Oh well,"" he said, ""it was fun while it lasted."" The four turned away, and began to prepare their meal, ignoring Ted. Ted lay like a broken doll, tears rolling down his cheeks. He tried to swallow, but couldn't, and then he looked up. Folco Boffin stood there, smiling at him sweetly. "" 'M sorry,"" Ted mumbled, "" 'm sorry."" Folco reached a hand down, and Ted reached up and grasped it, found himself standing next to the hobbit he had watched being murdered. And yet he saw, there was a hobbit lying there, battered and worn, who looked remarkably like himself. ""Come along,"" said Folco. ""It's all over now."" xxxxxxx ""That's not a very deep hole, Bart,"" said Harry. ""Who cares?"" replied the Man. ""Gash said bury him. He didn't say how deep."" ""Well, I'm glad he's dead. I'm not so much for the kind of sport that Gash and Krag like, and he was slowing us down."" Bart nodded, and they tipped the little body in, and scraped a shallow covering of dirt over it. ""Well, I hope we get out of here soon. Krag said he spotted one of them Rangers this morning. And where there's one there's more."" ""Aye,"" replied Harry. ""I think we should move on now."" He kicked a bit more dirt over the grave, and they walked off. xxxxxxx *Quotations in italics from The Return of the King , Book VI, Chapter VIII, ""The Scouring of the Shire"""
125,2,31,2-dreamflower02-31.txt,lord-of-the-rings,dreamflower02,"looked up at her, stricken, his blue eyes filled with tears, and he bolted from the nursery. She heard the door of his own room slam shut. And still Master Merry screamed, his little face red and hot. Dahlia stood there, holding the crying baby and jiggling him, all the while all she could see in her mind's eye was the poor lad's face after she had shouted at him. He loved his little cousin, he truly did. All he wanted was to help and she had been cruel to him. At her wit's end, she placed Merry in his cradle, still crying, his screams sometimes interspersed with little hiccups. She went across the hall, through the Master bedroom and tapped on Frodo's door. She could hear the sounds of weeping beyond the door, not screams of pain like the baby's tears, but the soft sound of a broken heart. Her face flamed with shame; she had done that to him for no good reason at all. She tapped again. ""I'm sorry, Master Frodo. I should not've shouted at you."" There was no response. ""I really am sorry. You did not do anything wrong, sir. It wasn't my place to speak so to you."" Her own eyes began to overflow, and she sniffled, and brushed the tears away brusquely. She could still hear Merry's pained cries, and knew she'd have to leave Frodo's door and go to tend her primary charge. But she still didn't know what else she could do. Once more she spoke. ""I am so sorry, Master Frodo."" She had turned and was about to leave when the door opened. ""I'm sorry, too, Dahlia,"" Frodo whispered. ""I don't mean to take your job from you, really, it's just that...it's my Merry."" His face turned towards the hallway and the nursery from which the cries were coming. Dahlia bent down and gave Frodo a small hug. ""Begging your pardon, young sir. But I should know. I used to feel the same about me little brothers and sisters."" She stood up. ""Do you think that you might be able to help?"" Frodo nodded, and led the way back to the nursery. He picked up the teething ring, and wiped it on his shirt, and then bent over the cradle. Ever so carefully he lifted the baby up. ""Shush, Merry-mine! It will be all right."" Merry stopped crying immediately, though he still sniffled and hiccupped. Frodo placed the teething ring near his mouth, and the baby took it and began chewing it and suckling it. Frodo carried his cousin over to the window seat and began to rock Merry back and forth, as he softly sang an old Shire lullaby: Drop, drop, drop Gently rolling rain, Sliding, sliding softly Down the window pane. Softly, softly falling Onto tree and plain. Listen to the raindrops, Plop, plop, plop, Here in my arms You are safe and warm. Quiet your little cries, Not a peep, peep, peep, Close your little eyes, And sleep, sleep, sleep. Close your little eyes, And sleep, sleep, sleep... As he sang, Merry dropped the teething ring. Frodo didn't stop, but gave Merry one of his fingers to chew on. He didn't even wince at the little bites from the two teeth Merry already had. After a while, Merry finally fell asleep with Frodo's finger still in his mouth, though the baby was suckling it instead of chewing on it. Dahlia sat down in the rocking chair in the nursery, with her knitting, and watched over Frodo and Merry, realising that she had never really understood before how deep the love was between the two young cousins. Now she knew that Merry needed Frodo's comfort, but that Frodo needed to give that comfort even more. From now on, she would accept Frodo's willing assistance when he chose to give it. It really was a beautiful thing to see. After a while, Merry stirred enough to release Frodo's finger, and Dahlia had Frodo put the sleeping baby into his cradle. Then she made a simple tea for the two of them of boiled eggs, scones and tea. The two of them sat in the sitting room, with the door to the nursery open, and Frodo told her amazing stories of his Uncle Bilbo's Adventures in the Wide World until the Master and Mistress came home. Later that evening, after Frodo had gone to bed, Dahlia confessed her words to Frodo to her Mistress. ""I know as it was wrong of me, Mistress Esmeralda, and if you want to dismiss me, I would understand. But I hope as you don't. I really love both them little ones, and if you'll have me I promise never to do such a thing ever again."" The young Mistress patted her on the hand. ""You had a trying day, Dahlia. But you apologized, and Frodo has forgiven you. I am quite sure he would not want me to dismiss you now."" She paused, and then added, ""Until Merry came along we were at a loss as to what to do with Frodo, he was so sunk in grief. Merry finally brought a bit of sunshine back into his life."" That night, as Dahlia lay in her bed, she listened to Merry's soft breathing. The Hall healer had given Mistress Esmeralda a tincture of chamomile to rub on the baby's gums, and he was now sleeping easily. It had been a long hard day, but now it was better. Just as she was starting to drop off, she saw the door to the nursery crack open, and Frodo padded in silently. He went over to the cradle and looked in at Merry. Then he bent over and softly kissed the baby on top of his head. ""Love you, Merry-mine,"" he whispered. ""Have a nice sleep."" He glanced over and saw Dahlia watching. ""You too, Dahlia. Good night."" Then he went out, closing the door behind him. She did have a very nice sleep that night."

Turning back all thoughts of fear, As we hold close our loved ones dear! The day is short; the night is long. Against the dark we sing this song- Let our hearts be filled with light And may the world again grow bright! We put up many stores ahead Against the cold months left to tread. Shall we now have meat and bread? Our bodies and our hearts be fed! The day is short; the night is long. Against the dark we sing this song- Let our hearts be filled with light And may the world again grow bright!

Against the dark we sing this song- Let our hearts be filled with light And may the world again grow bright! Light the Yule log, blazing cheer, Giving warmth this time of year. Turning back all thoughts of fear, As we hold close our loved ones dear! "" Gandalf blinked back unaccustomed tears, and turned to Bilbo. ""I do think, Bilbo, old friend, that I will have some of that apple-brandy punch now!"" Bilbo grinned and the two friends made their way to the punch bowl. The musicians were tuning up for dancing. Esmeralda was up on the bandstand with her fiddle, and Ferdinand with his Tookish pipes. Pearl had her tambour. Cousin Hildigar had his lute, and Aunt Peridot her lap-harp, and Uncle Everand had his drum. Soon music filled the Green Hills, and hobbits were dancing about the bonfire-and after a few cups of the punch, so was one wizard. Many of the children were joining in the circle dances, while others were running about playing. Bilbo spotted Frodo dancing Circle of Joy, his favourite dance, with little Pervinca. Merry was wrestling with Fatty. Bilbo glanced around. Pimpernel was over there with some lasses, playing a clapping game. Paladin and Eglantine were surrounded by Tooks, all of them eager to tell him of how dreadful life in the Great Smials was under Lalia's firm thumb. Where was young Pippin? Just then, Gandalf came to stand by Bilbo, slightly out of breath. ""Bilbo, Bilbo-have I ever told you that hobbits are amaz-amazing creatures? Truly amazing. Have I told you that?"" ""Gandalf! I do believe you are tipsy!"" ""Quite likely. That punch has quite a punch,"" and then Gandalf chuckled at his own joke. ""Have you seen little Pippin?"" ""Little Pippin? No, I don't suppose I have…shall we go look for him? But perhaps I should have some more punch first…"" ""No, Gandalf, I don't think so. I think some fresh air will be better for you. Let us see if we can find Pippin. I have a feeling that it would be a good idea."" The two looked carefully around the edges of the crowd. Gandalf had no trouble seeing over the heads of the crowd. ""There he is! Over by the bonfire."" The wizard peered more closely. ""Good heavens! What is he doing?"" ""What?"" asked Bilbo sharply. ""Quickly,"" said Gandalf. He hurriedly made his way to the bonfire, with Bilbo trotting at his heels-what *was* that lad doing? Gandalf reached down. ""Here, my lad! I'll take those."" He reached down and took a handful of sparklers from Pippin's hand. ""Were you going to light *all* of those at one time, Peregrin Took?"" Earnest green eyes gazed back. ""Yes! I thought they would look grand all lighted up together!"" Bilbo picked Pippin up. ""That is *not* a good idea, child! It could be very dangerous to light so many at once."" ""Oh."" They carried the lad over to his parents, who looked askance. ""Don't ask,"" said Bilbo. Paladin and Eglantine looked at one another with alarm, but their attention was drawn away by some of the other hobbits. Bilbo and Gandalf hurried away, to avoid any awkward questions. ""I suppose that I will have to tell them,"" said Bilbo, ""but I think it can wait until tomorrow. I have never known a child so young who could find so many ways to fall into trouble! It will be a miracle if he lives to grow up."" Gandalf stopped for a moment, and stared up at the sky. ""He will live to grow up. That child has a destiny."" Bilbo looked startled. ""Gandalf?"" For an instant, Gandalf paid him no mind, and then he shook his head and looked down. ""I'm sorry, Bilbo. I seem to have forgotten what I was going to say. I think I may have indulged in a bit too much of the punch. I think that I shall retire now."" Bilbo watched him walk away, his tall form swaying just a bit. ""I'm sure,"" he said to himself, ""that it must have been the apple-brandy talking. But it's been a splendid Yule! Why, I don't think there has been such a lovely Yule here since Grandfather Gerontius' time!"" xxxxx Far away in the Southfarthing, at the Hornblower family estate, Southfork, Lalia looked out her window, as she prepared to retire. The wedding had been every bit as extravagant as she had expected, and the Yule celebration afterwards had been magnificent. As her maid came to help her get ready for bed, Lalia smiled. She had been treated to a bountiful feast, and had received an expensive gift of a gold bracelet from the Hornblower himself. ""I have had a splendid Yule, Begonia. I am glad I could see my way clear to attending."" ""Yes, ma'am."" ""After all, Yule at the Great Smials is always such a dreary affair."""
127,2,45,2-dreamflower02-45.txt,lord-of-the-rings,dreamflower02,"Ask me."" ""The rooms I have now-those were his, were they not?"" ""Yes, Bilbo, they were. You were not the first hobbit to live a well-deserved retirement within these walls. Go now, and read what he has to say, and perhaps you will understand."" After returning to his rooms, he looked at them with new eyes. Now that he came to think of it, it was clear that the little kitchen and the small bedroom with its round door were not something new, built within the last few months, but had been there for a number of years. He prepared himself a light luncheon, and took it to his sitting room. Settling in next to the hearth, he began to read. He spent several days reading his uncle's journal, realizing that the two of them had far more in common than was first apparent. But Hildifons' life had turned out more difficult in the end than his own. It was something that gave him furiously to think. -oo000oo- One afternoon there came one of those odd weather days, in which winter seemed to retreat, and it felt more like fall or spring. Bilbo decided to take some fruit and the book outside and wander the gardens of Rivendell. He was still discovering places new to him, even among the paths and grounds nearest the House. The ground was bare, and save for such plants and trees as stayed ever green, the leaves were gone. There were holly trees, laurel, juniper and bay along a pleasant flagged path. Some of the thyme growing between the pathstones were yet green and gave a pleasant herbal scent. As in most of the gardens small benches and seats had been randomly placed for stopping and resting during a garden stroll. He espied the Lady Arwen seated on one such bench; she also had a book in hand. She looked up and gave him a warm smile. ""Will you not join me, Master Baggins?"" She patted the bench next to her. ""Since you are so kind, milady, I will."" He set down the little basket with Hildifons' journal and a couple of apples on the end of the bench, as he scrambled up. ""Please, call me Arwen,"" she said to him as he settled back. He offered her one of the apples, which she accepted. ""Only if you will call me Bilbo,"" he replied. ""The weather is delightful today."" ""Today only,"" she said. ""My father tells me the morning will bring frost again."" She glanced at the book in the basket. ""What are you reading?"" Bilbo took it out and showed her. ""It's my uncle's journal. I've finished it, but am still perusing it. Did you know him when he was here?"" She shook her head. ""No, I was gone for a number of years visiting my grandparents, when he was staying among us, and never had the chance to meet him then. I always wished that I had done so-my father and brothers speak very fondly of him."" ""And what are you reading, mil...I mean, Arwen?"" She lifted out the slim volume bound in blue, the cover lettered in gilded Tengwar. ""Ah,"" said Bilbo with a grin. ""The Lay of Leithian, the tale of Beren and Lúthien."" ""Yes, one of my favorite tales."" She gave a wistful sigh. Bilbo glanced up at her slyly. ""The Dúnadan left yesterday, didn't he?"" She looked down at him startled, and then laughed. ""You are most observant, Bilbo!"" He looked up at her with a grin, and gave her a cheeky wink of the eye. Shaking her head, she laughed again. Truly, the old hobbit was delightful. She foresaw that they would be great friends over time. -oo000oo- The weeks passed, and the weather grew colder. Bilbo had quite lost track of time; he thought that they were still in what was called ""Foreyule"" in the Shire, but he wasn't sure. He was fairly certain that Yule had not yet come, as the days were not growing longer yet, but he was not sure when the shortest day would come. He had spent a quiet and fairly normal day, and after a grand supper in the feast hall, he headed for the Hall of Fire. He was surprised when Elrond came up and asked ""May I walk with you, Bilbo?"" ""Of course...Elrond,"" he replied. He was still getting used to being on a first-name basis with the Lord of Rivendell. He supposed that over time he would find it easier. They entered through the wide double doors. ""Oh my!"" he said. The hall had been festooned with greenery! Bilbo looked up at his host with joy. ""I never expected such a thing!"" Elrond chuckled. ""Before he left on his latest patrol, Aragorn took great pains to remind me that the turning of the year holds great significance for your people. And my daughter has been reminding me for the last several days that today was the longest night. Happy Yule, Bilbo Baggins!"" -oo000oo- Lindelea's story is ""The Tenth Walker"", in which Merrylegs makes an appearance. Stories of mine that are referenced are: ""Tra-La-Lalley! Come Back to the Valley"" ""Warm Welcome Home"" ""The Birthday, S.R. 1402"" ""Trotter"" All of them are posted here on this site. ATTENTION: Since I can no longer link to my essays, I've decided to post some of them here on my profile, on a rotating basis. I hope to update each month, removing one and replacing it with another. If you have questions or comments about any of my essays, please feel free to PM me; I'd love to know what you think. This month I have posted a simple list I made: ""Shire Calendar Addendum: Election Years and Overlithe"". It is my hope that hobbit writers might find this useful. It lists all the years in Shire Reckoning during which either a Mayoral Election would occur, or which was a Leap Year by Shire Reckoning, during which the day called ""Overlithe"" would occur."
128,2,36,2-dreamflower02-36.txt,lord-of-the-rings,dreamflower02,"very thin. He was already on the path that would lead him out of Arda, but he was young and alone and confused. Gandalf had not the power to call him back, but he did have the power to lend him comfort and his presence so far as the Gates. He could not read the little one's thoughts, but he could feel his fëa , as it turned from confusion to joy, and there was a brief instant of gratitude sent his way before it flared and went beyond his ken. And Gandalf sent forth his own prayer of gratitude. And then wondered what he would tell the youth's remaining companions when they woke to find their kinsman gone from them. Morning came, bright and blue. The fire was down to mere coals, but the snow had stopped and the wind no longer howled. The cold felt less brittle. But Rumble and Bard could take no joy in it, for they had wakened to the news that Hammie had died in the night. He and Bard clung to one another, weeping silently for a while. Bard had done much of his grieving the day before when they realized this outcome was all too likely, but Rumble had held on to some hope once their mysterious new friend had arrived. Still, he did not blame Gandalf—it was unlikely he could have saved poor young Hammie. And at least the lad had been warm and comfortable in his last few hours. But now what were they to do? They still had no pony, and very little food was left, even with Gandalf's contributions—only a tiny bit of the journeybread. And—he hated to think it—but what about Hammie? Were they going to have to leave him here, in this forsaken place? Gandalf had laid Hammie's body out very gently and with dignity. Rumble thought that in death, his young cousin actually looked less blue than he had the day before. At least he no longer felt the cold. He was startled when Gandalf spoke. ""I know that it might be somewhat awkward, but I think it might be possible for Borin to pull your sleigh. I know the shafts will be short, but I think we can make the adjustments necessary…"" Given a practical problem to think about, both Rumble and Bard were able to put their grief aside for the moment. The three of them went over to the cart, and Gandalf used his long arms to sweep much of the snow off of it. He banged his staff on the sides, and soon it was cleared off. It was indeed a makeshift and awkward arrangement in the end, and Borin did not look very happy. But he was a placid-natured horse, and accepted his new role with only a little snorting. Hammie's body was laid in the back, and Rumble and Bard sat in the seat. Gandalf was going to walk and lead the horse, for there was no way that the hobbits could handle driving such a large beast, nor any way Gandalf could fit upon the seat of the sleigh. ""The only question now,"" said Gandalf, ""is where are we going?"" ""If there's no more snow,"" replied Rumble, ""we could make it to the Bridge Inn in half a day."" ""Very well,"" replied the old Man. He urged the horse forward, and they began their journey in silence. The Sun continued to be bright, and lend her warmth to the three weary travellers. Perhaps, thought Gandalf, Spring was on the way at last. He noted the melting snow dripping from branches and heard the occasional ""crack"" of breaking icicles. He looked at his small companions, who grieved as they were over the loss of the younger one, still looked about them. Ferumbras spoke. ""Perhaps Spring's come at last!"" There was a note of hopefulness in his voice in spite of all that had happened. ""If only we could have found more food in Bree,"" said Flambard. ""I do not know what we will tell Aunt Miradonna; it seems as if poor Hammie died without purpose."" Ferumbras shook his head. ""Hammie would insist on going, you know—he might even have followed us if we had not given our permission. And his heart was in the right place."" ""It was,"" Flambard agreed. ""He was a brave lad, and he worried so over the others. I know it weighed on him, the hunger of the younger children."" ""It weighs on me as well,"" said Ferumbras, ""the hunger of the children, and of the old folk, too. Not to mention everyone else. But winter can't last forever. Things will come 'round soon, you'll see."" ""I know. And we'll see to it that everyone honours Hammie for his courage and great heart."" Flambard took a deep breath. ""And we are not home yet; we may still find some provisions along the way to take back with what we've got. And though what we've got isn't much, it's better than nothing at all."" ""You're right, cousin,"" said Ferumbras. ""And word was sent to Brandybucks in Buckland before we left, and to Bandy in the Northfarthing! Hobbits will help each other, you'll see!"" Gandalf, walking alongside the horse, looked in amazement at his small companions. There was no sign of defeat about them, sorrowful though they were at the loss of their cousin. They clung to hope, and spoke lightly and without doubt. What amazing creatures these little people were—such great hearts as he had not encountered before, out of all proportion to their size, and filled with Pity and kindness. He was glad of this encounter, and he would accompany them home if they would allow it, and do what he could to succour them and their people. It felt right somehow, almost as though it was a memory of something that had happened already. He knew in his heart that he had found friends, and he could not think their meeting now was Chance."
129,2,21,2-dreamflower02-21.txt,lord-of-the-rings,dreamflower02,"down and took his foot-brush to his feet. He had the little room assigned to the pages all to himself- the others were already down in the kitchen getting ready to do their jobs. He tucked the handkerchief Elanor had embroidered for him with his initials, into his pocket, and then headed for his father's guest room in the hobbit wing. Frodo was not even halfway there when he met his father coming in his direction. Sam grinned at him, and took Frodo-lad's elbow as they turned and went to the feast hall. ""Where is Mr. Hornblower?"" asked Frodo. ""He went to dinner down to Foregate. Turns out him and Mayor Sandheaver are fourth cousins on their mothers' sides, so they got some catching up to do."" Soon they were seated at the High Table. His father sat to the King's left hand, and Frodo sat the other side of his father. It seemed very strange to be sitting there, and he looked up in startlement, when Tarostar appeared next to him and poured water into his goblet. He looked at the other page and caught his eye, and Tarostar blushed. Frodo noticed that when Taro served the famous Lord Samwise, his hands trembled, though he did not spill anything. The food was plentiful: a huge trout served on a hot plank; roast pheasant from a recent hunting served with roasted parsnips and carrots and mushrooms; a savory pie of mixed meats; hen's eggs, boiled and covered with sausage and then fried ( a receipt, Sam-dad said, as was popular in the Tooklands, and gifted to the cook by Uncle Pippin) ; a soup of summer vegetables; a salad of mixed greens, with cucumbers and tomatoes, sprinkled with chopped herbs (Frodo detected basil and summer savory and parsley) and some vinegar and fine oil. There was fine white bread and brown, and cheeses of all sorts. And for afters, a pastry baked in the shape of a swan and filled with strawberries, bilberries and sweetened cream, as well as some sweets baked in the shape of mushrooms. Frodo found the food delicious and plentiful. He could not understand the complaints of some of the courtiers who had come from the South at the ""simple fare"" of the Northern Court, but it suited the King, and so the complaints were usually only voiced in front of servants or pages. They were at the stage that hobbits called ""filling up the corners"", which he and his dad were doing with some of the bread and cheese, when Master Menelcar, the King's Bard came forth to sing. ""We are honoured tonight to have with us one of the Ringbearers, and so in his honour, I shall sing a song I composed after the War, to celebrate our pheriannath heroes. I call it ' The Smallest Hands' ."" Menelcar began to sing, his voice in no way diminished by his age. Frodo-lad had never heard this one sung before, and he looked on his father once more in pride, to hear him placed alongside all the great heroes of the Ages. Sam-dad's face had that faraway look it often got when he thought of Uncle Frodo, and tears glistened in the brown eyes. And Frodo-lad was filled with love for his father at that moment, and if they had not been sitting there in front of the King and everybody, he would have hugged him as hard as ever he could. The song ended, and Sam-dad took out his pocket handkerchief and blew his nose. The King turned, and put a hand on his shoulder, and got a smile in return. Then he leaned around to speak to Frodo. ""Frodo, your father reminded me of something today. I should have realised how much you would miss working in a garden. From now on, you shall have one day a week in which to do so, starting tomorrow."" Oh! He was so happy he nearly could not speak for a moment, and then he said, ""Oh thank you , Sire!"" The King and his father laughed, and the Queen bent one of her lovely smiles upon him, and Frodo felt that it was a fitting ending to one of the best days he'd had since coming to Annúminas. He had seen his father off the next morning, with many messages for his mother and sibs and friends in the Shire, and then dressed in sturdy but worn work clothes, he had gone in search of Mr. Thistlewool, the head gardener, to find out what needed doing. And now, he was happily trimming the verge about the fountain in the very same garden where he and his father had picnicked the day before, whistling a cheery tune. He stopped a moment, as he heard another song. "" Filip filip filip codidio codidio quitquiquit tittit tittit tereret tereret tereret , !"" Frodo grinned up at the throstle in the poplar. He felt quite as blithe and happy as the bird did. xxxxxxxxxx A/N: Information on the throstle (or song thrush) came from the Wikipedia entry on the Song Thrush, and on the Birds of Britain site . ""The Song Thrush (Turdus philomelos) is a thrush that breeds across much of Eurasia. It is also known in English dialects as throstle or mavis."" ""The Song Thrush has a short, sharp tsip call, replaced on migration by a thin high seep, similar to the Redwing's call but shorter. The alarm call is a chook-chook becoming shorter and more strident with increasing danger. The male's song, given from trees, rooftops or other elevated perches, is a loud clear run of musical phrases, repeated two to four times, filip filip filip codidio codidio quitquiquit tittit tittit tereret tereret tereret, and interspersed with grating notes and mimicry. It is given mainly from February to June by the Outer Hebridean race, but from November to July by the more widespread subspecies. For its weight, this species has one of the loudest bird calls."""
130,2,42,2-dreamflower02-42.txt,lord-of-the-rings,dreamflower02,"The cousins looked at Sam, wondering how he would feel about it. He nodded. ""All o' mine save Ruby, Robin and little Tom have heard it all, and they've heard Mr. Bilbo's part. Ruby turns twenty this year. I'll be letting her listen to the other parts now. Elanor and Frodo-lad, o' course have read it for themselves. Rosie-lass, Merry-lad and Pippin-lad have read bits of it, but Goldilocks asked t'other day could she read it for herself."" ""What about others?"" asked Merry. ""Not many in Hobbiton has the interest."" Sam heaved a great sigh. ""There's them around here don't remember Mr. Frodo at all. Jolly's read it, though. He heard so much of it when he was away South, he said he wanted to know the right of it. Still, I wish more would care about it."" ""Well, Sam,"" said Pippin, ""most hobbits feel what's done is done and over and done. Those aren't the sorts of tales they want to know about. And if they aren't family, you can't make them."" The three looked at one another, and nodded wistfully. This was quite true. -oo000oo- Merry had become used to seeing Merimas sitting in the middle of the Master's study on the tall stool at the bookstand, silently reading. Every once in a while, he'd stop and look over and ask Merry a question. ""What was all that business about the Elves and the Dwarves? Why don't they get on?"" ""What was Gandalf up to when he went off and left Bilbo and the Dwarves to fend for themselves? ""Who is Elbereth?"" ""How come the Elves made all those Rings? Couldn't they tell who Sauron was?"" ""A Balrog? It seems that all the Big Folk knew what that was, but it's not clear to me."" ""I don't understand all that business with the Lady Galadriel. What kind of test was she talking about, and how could passing it diminish her?"" ""Why did that Lord Denethor want to keep from turning the country over to the King? Come to that, why wasn't King Elessar king all along?"" ""He'd been betrothed to the Queen the whole time? Why did no one know of it? And why did he not tell you that you were waiting for his wedding? There were others as well, and Merry would try to answer, but sometimes he realised that his own information was scanty at best. Merimas would purse his lips and give Merry that sort of look he remembered getting occasionally from Uncle Dinodas, or rarely from Frodo or Bilbo- a look that said he'd come ill-prepared for his lesson and was a disappointment as a scholar. It irked him to get such a look from a cousin who was the same age as he, or, come to think of it, younger by a year! Sometimes Merimas would come in to read when Merry was not in his study. One afternoon, a few weeks after Merimas had begun to read, Merry returned after supper to fetch a book for himself and saw Merimas sitting there, just staring at the book, his face stricken. ""You've finished."" Merimas nodded. ""I never truly understood. I don't think I understand now completely. But you are right. This is something our young people should read. Not too young, though."" ""I agree. Tweens, of course. I fear the tale would be far too frightening to the youngest of your pupils."" ""I wish I had known Frodo better when he was here."" Merry felt that sharp stab of grief that even now would come upon him unawares. He swallowed it down, and took a deep breath. All he said was ""I wish you had, too."" -oo000oo- That night a hard rain woke Merry from a sound sleep. He rose from his bed quietly, so as not to disturb Estella, and went to look out the window. Storms were far more disturbing to him since the big flood twenty-five years ago. This was just an ordinary Blommath storm, but he knew he'd not settle to sleep until it slacked off. Seventy-six was by no means old, but he wasn't as young as he used to be either. He put on his dressing gown and went into the small kitchen of the Master's apartment, and made himself of a cup of tea, and slipped out with it and padded across the passage to his study. There he sat down behind his large desk, and sipped his tea. An idea was forming in his mind. Years ago, perhaps a year or two before the revelation of the Ring, Frodo had toyed with an idea of writing a history of the Northern kingdoms, but had put it aside reluctantly when he realised there was not enough information in the Shire to do the subject justice. But of course, that was before he knew where such a source of information could be found. Merry knew he was not nearly the scholar that Frodo had been, but perhaps it would honour his cousin if he could take up such a work. And perhaps it need not be merely confined to the Northern kingdoms… He pursed his lips in thought for a moment, and then pulled out a sheet of paper from his drawer, and picked up his quill. Dipping it in the ink, he began to write. ""Brandy Hall 5 Blommath, S.R. 1458, Fourth Age 37, My Lord Celeborn, Greetings from Buckland, and my wish that all is well in Rivendell. I am writing to you in the hopes that you will be able to assist me in a project which I have in mind…"" The rain had stopped and the grey light of dawn had begun to light the sky above the Old Forest when he had finished. He'd time to slip back to bed for an hour or so. He was glad the weather was clearing. He'd have someone take the letter up to the King's Messenger at the Messenger House by the Bridge today."

The feast was ended, and Frodo could not get Merry out of the crush too soon. He saw to getting his younger cousins into bed, and then sat up to wait for the others. It was not too long before Saradoc and Esmeralda arrived, along with Paladin. Eglantine had taken the lasses to the guest rooms the Tooks used on their visits to Brandy Hall-all save Pippin who had his own room near Merry's. Saradoc dropped heavily into his favorite chair with a deep sigh of exhaustion. Esmeralda moved behind him, and began to knead her husband's neck. ""I am surprised to see you still awake, Frodo."" Frodo shrugged. ""I wanted to speak to you, Uncle Sara. I need to return to Bag End soon-and I wanted to ask, will you allow Merry to finish his visit there? I know things will have to be different now he's the Son of the Hall."" Saradoc pursed his lips and leaned forward. ""To be honest, Frodo, I'd not thought that far ahead. But I have no intention of plunging Merry into such duties now-he's still too young and his grief too new. I suppose that starting next year, I will gradually increase his responsibilities. But actually, I think I would be very grateful if you returned with him to Bag End. He needs to be away from things here until they settle down a bit. Don't think I haven't noticed how well you protected him the last couple of days from those who would have used his youth to take advantage of him."" ""I'll always watch after Merry, Uncle, you know that. It's not something you have to thank me for."" ""I do know that, Frodo. But I'm grateful all the same. If you can persuade him to rest tomorrow, then I think it would not be thought improper if you took him back with you the day after."" Frodo turned to Paladin. ""Paladin? What about Pippin?"" Paladin nodded. ""I'd not be so cruel as to separate him from Merry now of all times. But the journey back should not be in such haste-I was very proud of how well he endured it, but I think you should make your way slower upon your return."" ""Actually,"" said Frodo, ""if both were returning with me, I had planned to hire a trap, and drive as far as Budgeford. A day or so in Fatty's and Folco's pleasant company, and then we would have a nice leisurely walk the rest of the way, camping out and taking our time."" ""That sounds an excellent plan. I will see to the return of the hired ponies, then."" xxxxxxx The next day, the young people remained in the apartment. Merry and Pippin, watched over by Frodo were joined by Pippin's sisters and Merry's cousin Berilac. They spent the day playing games, chatting and eating. The other adults returned in time for tea. But after tea, Frodo quietly slipped away for awhile, and made his way to Cousin Calla's apartment. ""She's feeling poorly today, Mr. Frodo,"" said Yarrow at the door. ""Is that Frodo Baggins, Yarrow?"" called a soft voice weakly. ""Please do show him in."" Yarrow stood back disapprovingly. It was clear that she did not feel her mistress was up to company. ""I won't stay long,"" Frodo told her reassuringly. This time, Frodo was shown into Calla's bedchamber. She was propped against pillows, her face nearly as pale as the bedlinens. Her sketchbook lay closed upon the bed, next to her legs. ""It's good to see you again, Frodo. Did you come to say farewell?"" He nodded. ""I saw you yesterday. I fear it was nearly too much for you."" ""It probably was. But I owed Rory and Gilda that much. They did so much for me when I could no longer be of any use to anyone."" Frodo wanted to protest this self-deprecation, but he feared that to do so would simply tire her more. Instead he said ""I was glad to see you once more."" She nodded. ""My sketchbook. Look at the last page-it came to me yesterday when I returned here, and I could not rest until I got it down. What it means, I do not know, but I wanted you to see it."" Curiously, he turned to the last page, and felt a shock of recognition followed by a feeling of amazed joy. ""I've never seen the sea,"" she said, ""but I am sure that is what it is."" He nodded. Nor had he seen the sea, but he had no doubt that was what he gazed upon. There was a sandy beach, and waves lapping upon it, and a solitary figure of a person walking on the shore. He suddenly realized it was himself. And then, as he studied the picture, he glanced at the clouds sketched in above the horizon-there was something about them. Suddenly, he realized there were faces in the clouds looking down at him: his parents. ""Oh my!"" he exclaimed softly. ""Take it."" He looked at her. Was she sure? She nodded once more. ""Take it."" So he very carefully tore it loose from the rest of the sketchbook, and rolling it up, he placed it in his jacket. He bent over and kissed the pale brow. ""Good-bye, Cousin Calla."" She smiled wearily at him. ""Farewell, Cousin Frodo."" And her eyes closed, her breathing soft and rhythmic-she was already asleep. xxxxxxx Frodo, Merry and Pippin left early the following morning, to return to Bag End. It was the last time Frodo saw Calla Brandybuck. She died quietly in her sleep before the following Yule. xxxxxxx *While only Rorimac ""Old Rory"" Brandybuck is listed as dying in S.R. 1408, I do not think it much of a stretch, given what we know of hobbit marriage, that Menegilda might have died at the same time. After seventy years of marriage, the bond had to be pretty strong."

Frodo winked at him. ""What else but mushroom soup?"" Till made a little squeaking noise. ""Mushroom soup!"" He bounced about a little, and then stopped, looking abashed. ""I'm sorry, Mr. Frodo. I didn't mean to forget my manners."" Frodo shook his head in amusement. The lad was shyer than Sam, and apparently quite well drilled in what was ""proper"". ""That's all right, Till. I take it you like mushroom soup?"" He laughed at the vigorous nod that was the reply. ""Well, when you get back up here, do you know how to clean mushrooms?"" ""Very gently, mam says."" Till headed into the larder and soon returned the tin bowl filled with all the things Frodo had requested. Taking a small damp cloth, Frodo handed it to Till, along with the mushrooms he'd set aside for the soup, and the lad began to carefully wipe off the bits of compost. While Till had been in the larder, Frodo had put a small cast iron spider* onto the hearth to heat. Now he peeled and chopped the onion, and then put a knob of butter into the spider to melt. He threw in the onion, and while it cooked he took the mushrooms Till had cleaned and gave them a rough chop and tossed them in with the butter as well. He allowed Till to mince the herbs, once he was sure the child knew how to use a knife. He poured the broth and herbs in with the onion and mushrooms and allowed it all to simmer for a while. As it cooked he sliced a couple of pieces of dark bread and he and Till used the toasting forks to toast it. Once the soup was cooked, Frodo forced it through a sieve into a small pot, which he put back before the fire, and stirred in the sour cream. Finally, he put each piece of the toast into a bowl and ladled the soup in. The two sat down at the kitchen table with the soup and cups of tea, as Frodo gently questioned the lad. He'd known Daddy Twofoot all his life, but the old hobbit's son and his family had only recently moved back to Hobbiton to stay with him. Till was not quite as talkative as even Sam, but Frodo learned quite a bit. In return, he told the lad a bit about Buckland and Yule in Brandy Hall. They finished the meal, and Till helped Frodo with the washing up. Frodo loaded Till's now empty basket with the ham and the bags of nuts, and led him to the door. ""Ah, one more thing,"" he said, ""I almost forgot!"" He stuck his hand in his pocket and brought out a silver penny. Till froze. Frodo waited for the child to take it from his hand, but Till wasn't moving. ""Till, aren't you going to take your penny?"" He was back to whispering and stammering. ""M-Mr. Frodo? That penny's silver !"" ""Yes, Till, I know. I'm all out of coppers."" He reached down and took the lad's hand and put the silver penny there. ""You give that to your mother; she can get it changed, and give you back a copper. And then she can take care of the rest of it, if you want to share it with your family."" ""Yes, sir. Thank you, sir."" His eyes were round as saucers, and he touched his forehead. ""And thank you for the soup and everything."" ""You are welcome, lad. Off you go, now, and you have a Good Yule and a Happy New Year, you and your family!' ""Yes, sir!"" He turned then and took two steps, and then turned back ""Sam said you were splendid, sir, and well, I-I reckon he's right"" he blushed furiously, and trotted off as quickly as he could with his laden basket. Frodo watched him as he passed through the gate and down the lane. The youngster really had been useful, and good company as well. Now he could spend the rest of the day and tomorrow giving out his gifts, and be ready to leave at first light the day after. He was planning to hire a trap from The Ivy Bush stable. Soon he'd be in Buckland and seeing his kin once more. He went back in, whistling ""No Shorter Now Will Grow the Days"". He really loved this time of year. And fresh mushrooms in Foreyule? Who would have thought it? *A spider is what a cast iron skillet with feet is called. It can set easily on a hearth. Frodo's Herbed Mushroom Soup Ingredients: 3 Tbsp. Butter 1 small onion chopped 1 lb. white mushrooms chopped 3 1/2 c. vegetable stock 3 Tbsp. finely minced herbs* 2/3 c. sour cream Salt and pepper to taste Directions 1. Melt half the butter in a pan; sauté the onion until soft and translucent. Add the remaining butter and stir in the mushrooms until they brown nicely. 2. Stir in the stock and herbs, and bring to a boil, and simmer about 20 minutes. Use an immersion blender, or transfer to a processor or blender, and process until smooth. (Or use Frodo's method and force through a ricer or a sieve.) 3. Return soup to the pan, stir the sour cream and season to taste, reheating gently. Place a piece of crisp buttered toast (preferably a dark bread)** in the bottom of a warmed bowl, and ladle the soup over it. Serve immediately. -ooo000ooo- *I find the best way to mince herbs is to use kitchen shears to snip them coarsely into a small condiment dish, and then use the tips of the shears to mince them finely. With this dish, I'd probably use thyme, rosemary, maybe tarragon, and parsley. Or I might use only one herb. **I like a dark rye, or a hearty multi-grain for this"

Merry, I've someone I want you to meet!"" The other hobbit made his way to them with an engaging grin. ""Merry, this is Valdarion's cousin Margil."" Merry made a little half-bow. ""Meriadoc Brandybuck, at your service and your family's,"" he said politely. Margil took a deep breath, and returned the gesture. ""Margil son of Marcarion, at yours?"" he said hesitantly. Pippin laughed. ""Now there's a clever lad and a quick learner,"" he said proudly, ""even if he did not believe in hobbits!"" Margil flushed again. He supposed he'd never hear the end of it, but he did not feel as bad about the teasing as he would have a day before. Pippin looked up, and saw Frodo gesturing to him, and many of the guests were moving towards the inner chamber where the actual talks would take place. ""I'll leave Margil to you, shall I Merry? It looks like they need me now."" Margil felt somewhat bereft as Pippin rushed off, but he had little time for it. Merry smiled at him and said, ""So you did not believe in us?"" ""I did not really think about it, Sir Meriadoc,"" he confessed ruefully. ""So many unbelievable things have happened lately, and somehow, that just seemed one thing too much."" Suddenly he remembered that night in Pelargir, and gave a shudder. He bit his lip, and hoped that Sir Meriadoc had not noticed. But the sharp grey eyes were looking at him intently. ""Let's find a quiet corner to talk,"" he said. ""And call me Merry."" He led Margil off to a bench beneath a window, far from the crowded center of the room. As they walked, he said ""You know, before we came here, I did not believe in oliphaunts— what you call mûmakil !"" Margil gave him a look of astonishment. Merry laughed. ""You see, I could believe in Elves and Dwarves and Dragons and Trolls and Goblins—after all, old Cousin Bilbo had seen them himself, and as Frodo believed Bilbo, so did I. But Cousin Bilbo admitted he had never actually seen an oliphaunt himself, so I felt that I could doubt them. It seemed impossible to me that any animal could be so large!"" Margil gave a chuckle as they sat down upon the bench. He was unprepared to see his companion suddenly turn serious. ""So, Margil, what unbelievable thing frightened you so?"" If his father or his uncle or even his cousin had asked him that question, Margil knew that he would have hotly denied having been frightened by anything! But somehow he knew that this hobbit would understand. ""I didn't cover my head that night as everyone else did— I saw the Army of the Dead go by. I felt cold all the way through, my stomach dropped clear to my toes, my heart was pounding so fast I thought it would burst, and I could hardly breathe. I was terrified. But I did not wish anyone to know…"" Merry nodded, and gave a little shudder of his own. ""I think I understand, Margil. I have felt that way many times since I left my home."" ""But you are so brave!"" Margil exclaimed. ""So they tell me,"" Merry said. ""But don't mistake that with never being afraid…"" When Margil's mother, sister and aunt found him, he and Merry had been talking for a long time, and he felt lighter than he had in many weeks. ""Come, Margil,"" said his aunt. ""Master Meriadoc, the talks will be going on for quite a while today. If you will excuse Margil, we are going to return to our home."" Merry stood. ""Indeed, Mistress Elisien! It has been a pleasure. I am sure that all of us will come to call on you again soon."" Margil turned as they left to give the hobbit a farewell wave. And that night, for the first time since that horrible night of the passing of the Dead, Margil slept truly and well. xxxxx The next day the four hobbits paid an informal visit to the gardens of Margil's aunt and uncle. He watched them carefully and listened to all they said. For the first time, he got the chance to meet and speak to the Ring-bearer, the Cormacolindor . Frodo was quieter than Pippin, more serious than Merry, less practical than Samwise, yet he seemed to see more deeply. And he so appreciated beautiful things. Margil was privileged to see them there a few more times. They came to say farewell to the family shortly after the King's wedding, and it was all Margil could do to avoid weeping openly. He noticed Valdarion was also blinking back the glitter in his eyes. Valariel and Arniel were sobbing, and Meliseth flung herself on Pippin, and begged them not to go. Frodo knelt and dried her tears and comforted her, reminding her gently that Gondor was not their home, but they would never forget them. But Margil had been very thoughtful. And before the year turned, he had convinced his father to apprentice him to an overland trader. Someday, perhaps, he could bring goods to the North, to Arnor, to Bree, maybe even to the Shire… xxxxx Author's End Notes: If you have not read Larner's original story, I encourage you to do so. I do hope I've done it justice with this remix from Margil's POV. The ending of the story is particularly beautiful, and I did not feel I could even begin to approach it so well, but I hope that I've given some hint of how that ending came about. The feast, as I described it using modern terms, is based on a Medieval feast recreated, and the proper names of the dishes and links to the recipes, both original and modern redactions, may be found at AEthelmearc Academy November XXXIII at the Gode Cookery website."
134,2,27,2-dreamflower02-27.txt,lord-of-the-rings,dreamflower02,"and finally signed it himself: ""Frodo Baggins, Deputy Mayor."" Sam and Rosie and the other witnesses stepped away, and Frodo put an arm around Tom's and Marigold's shoulders. ""I present to you Mr. and Mrs. Tolman Cotton the Younger."" He leaned toward Tom. ""You can kiss her now, Tom."" To the cheers and laughter of all their guests, Tom bussed his bride soundly. She blushed, and then kissed him back just as firmly. xxxxxxx_ Frodo now took his jacket off, and prepared to enjoy himself as a guest. He turned to see Merry standing behind him, and glaring at Pippin, who was chatting with Sam's young cousin Snowdrop. ""I think "" said Merry, through gritted teeth, ""that I am just going to kill him and tell everyone he died."" This would have alarmed anyone else but Frodo, who was well aware of Merry's moods, especially with regards to Pippin. ""What did he get you into this time?"" ""Oh, he only volunteered me to play the tambour for the dancing this afternoon."" Frodo bit his lip to stifle a chuckle. ""And you agreed?"" ""Well, I could hardly say 'no' with everyone staring at me, could I?"" ""Maybe it won't be so bad, Merry. You used to be pretty good with that thing."" ""In private."" Merry flushed. He had never cared for the idea of performing for an audience-it was why he wouldn't let his mother teach him the fiddle. ""Well, you're committed, now, cousin, you'll just have to make the best of it."" But Frodo was privately amused, and felt that Merry was now getting a taste of his own medicine. He had not quite forgiven him for maneuvering him into taking the Deputy Mayor's job. Merry sighed. He'd not done too badly in their practice session behind the barn, though he could tell Pip thought he was keeping the beat a bit slow. Maybe it wouldn't be a total disaster. Just then Pippin came up and plucked at his sleeve. ""Come on, Merry, we'll be playing in just a moment."" And he began to drag Merry off with him, just as the notes from old Wil Cotton's pipes got all the guest's attention. The musicians were gathered beneath the tree where the ceremony had taken place. Nibs looked at them before he put his flute to his lips. ""We'll start with 'Southfarthing Brawl'(1) and then do 'Happy Hob'.(2) Merry groaned inwardly. Why did they have to start with Southfarthing Brawl? It got faster and faster toward the end. But there was nothing for it, the other players were ready to begin. It started well enough, and at first Merry thought things might not be so bad, but as the music began to speed up, he started to lose the rhythm. Desperately he tried to keep up, but fielding glares from the other musicians, he flushed and dropped out. He cast his fiercest glare towards Pippin, but Pippin, who was fairly glowing with the music, cast a smile his way full of fond encouragement. Pippin gave Merry a couple of firm nods to the beat, and soon, by keeping his eyes on his cousin, he was able to get back into the music, and even managed the fast run up to the end of the piece. Merry flashed Pippin a triumphant grin, which Pippin returned along with a look that said ""I told you so."" Maybe this wouldn't be so bad after all… The music started for ""Happy Hob"", which was one of Merry's favorite dances. The last time he had danced that was with Estella at Sam's wedding. This wasn't so bad. They went through a number of Merry's favorite dances, nothing unfamiliar. Soon they were playing the Tangle Dance.(3) They'd take a break after this. Merry watched the dancers-why that was Frodo leading the Tangle! He and Pippin grinned again. It was worth it to see Frodo dancing again. After the music ended, and the dancers had extricated themselves, the guests all descended on the tables, and began to help themselves to food and drink. Pippin handed Merry an ale, and Merry took it gratefully. ""See, Merry, it's not so bad."" ""No, Pip, it's not so bad. But I wouldn't want to make a habit of it."" After the food and drink had found its place, the musicians went back to work. They played a few songs that were just for listening to, and then after a while, they struck up ""Exchanges"".(4) Everyone thought it would be great fun to try and cut the bridal couple, but Tom and Marigold were very nimble, and managed to stay together through the whole dance, in spite of some very determined efforts by Tom's younger brothers, and by some of Marigold's friends. There was much laughter from those watching, at the various tricks that were tried and failed. The music continued with a few breaks here and there, throughout the afternoon. The food and drink kept being replenished, and there were a number of hobbits who began to flag. Finally, as the sun began to set, Tom's Uncle Wil piped the couple to the door of the little cottage that had been built nearby. xxxxxxx Sam and Rose walked back to Bag End with Frodo, Merry and Pippin. ""That was a lovely wedding, Sam,"" Rose said. ""Not so lovely as our own, Rosie-lass."" Sam dropped a kiss on top of her head as they walked hand in hand. A few steps ahead, the cousins walked quietly. The stars began to come out. Frodo looked up at them, thinking that today had been a very nice finish to his duties as Deputy Mayor. xxxxxxx I can't post the links to the music played on this site, but if you search, you can likely find them: (1)To hear the Southfarthing Brawl, search for Califian Bransle. 2)To hear Happy Hob, search for Mairi's Wedding. (3) To hear the Tangle Dance, search for the Tangle Bransle (4) To hear Exchanges, search for Hole in the Wall."
135,2,14,2-dreamflower02-14.txt,lord-of-the-rings,dreamflower02,"choke, he was the last to finish, taking his time, and sometimes just dipping it into the sauce and licking it off without a bite. He'd always been one who loved to play with his food as much as to eat it, and this food was perfect for that. ""I have to say, Merry,"" Frodo said, when he had finally finished his, ""this is a most remarkable discovery! I wonder who would ever have thought to try eating one of these, though? They are so formidable looking!"" Everyone laughed, and Sam said, ""I wonder would these grow in the Shire?"" ""Master Elrond had a very few plants in the garden at Rivendell,"" Strider said. ""They took a good deal of pampering even in the mildest of winters. But once established they bore year after year, though never very prolifically."" Sam nodded thoughtfully. ""I suppose I could give it a try. Mayhap I could cover them over in the winter, like asparagus."" ""It would certainly be worth a try, even if we only ever grew enough for one such feast as this,"" said Frodo thoughtfully. I was delighted to see the look of determination spring up on Sam's face, and I knew that he'd see to it that he grew some of them for Frodo, no matter how much work it was. We talked for a while, discussing some of the things that had been going on in the camp, and hearing the latest news from Faramir in the City, when Strider gave an exclamation! ""The sand has run out, Pippin, and I never noticed. It is time for your draught, and for you, Sam and Frodo to retire."" Pippin made a face, but did not otherwise complain, as he drank down the unpleasant draught. The Big Folk left, though I could tell they had only gone so far as just outside. I helped Pippin into his bed, and then turned to tuck up Frodo and Sam. I'd been doing that since they first wakened. It made Sam blush furiously, and he would always object, but I did it anyway. It was fun to watch him turn red. Frodo suffered my attentions with a sly murmur of ""Thank you, sprout."" That made me blush, as it was a reminder of my childhood when Frodo had always tucked me in. And I wasn't going to object to his using my baby-name. He was alive, and he could call me any names he wanted. I turned to make sure Pip was covered, and dropped a kiss on his forehead. He was already sleepy from the draught. ""I'll be back in a few minutes, Pip."" ""Wish I could have a smoke and a sniff of air,"" he muttered. But he was already asleep by the time I went outside to join Gandalf, Strider and Gimli for a brief evening pipe. Legolas had left to ""go check on Arod"", his usual excuse to get away from the scent of pipeweed. Our supply of leaf from Isengard was low, so we kept it quick. Better a short smoke once in a while than no smoke at all. I soon left the others and went back into the tent. I checked on Frodo and Sam, and then on Pippin. I was tempted to crawl in beside him, but I had promised Strider that I would take my rest in my own cot—he thought I did not sleep soundly enough when I was by Pippin, since I feared to hurt him if I moved in my sleep. I felt quite pleased with myself. Often I had felt I did not contribute enough to the efforts that had been made during and after the War, but last night I felt as though I had accomplished something with my foraging, and especially in finding a new and unusual food that everyone had enjoyed. I hoped that I could find more of those, and perhaps some other new and exotic food that my cousins and Sam could enjoy. And I did not forget the location of those strawberries…a week? Ten days? I would check on them often—it would not do for the birds to get at them before I could. Good heavens! I have been writing for quite a while! I am sure that the others are awake by this time. Sure enough, the King's cousin Éothain pokes his head into the tent. ""Holdwine! Are you still here? The Ringbearer was asking after you just a few moments ago!"" I slip down from my cushioned chair and roll up the pages I have been writing upon. I know that Éomer King will not begrudge me them, and I would like to have these notes to refer to. I am certain that I will once more have the chance to prepare artichokes sometime. *End Notes I had the bunny for this story at once when I received my prompt words. However in researching it, I discovered it was unlikely that artichokes would be at the harvestible stage that early in the year. Since the bunny would not go away, and Merry insisted his encounter with the strange veggie took place at Cormallen, I can only conclude that this was a strain peculiar to Ithilien, one which was ready to eat far earlier than other sorts. Also, the explanation for the name ""artichokes"" is a bit of false folk etymology; the name actually comes from the Arabic. But I thought the popular myth would be suitable for Middle-earth. The recipe I used here is one that I must confess I have never personally tried. (I have cooked and eaten artichokes in the conventional manner.) It came from an excellent book called The Magic of Fire: Hearth Cooking, One Hundred Recipes for the Fireplace and Campfire by William Rubel. It is filled with delightful information about cooking with real fire, and is a marvelous resource for anyone who writes fic set in a time and place when cooking would have been done with woodfire."

And very soon, Sam will be here as well. Estella is also on her way back, though she has left the children in Freddy's and Angelica's care."" Merry gaped at Pippin, speechless. ""And Ilberic?"" Pippin continued, ""Would you be so kind as to see if we could have a bit of second breakfast? My stomach thinks my throat's been cut!"" Ilberic winced at this brutal expression, but nodded and hurried off, finally leaving Merry and Pippin alone in the study. ""Oh, Pip!"" Merry said quietly, ""I knew you'd come if you could. But I really didn't think there was any way you could get here."" ""Merry, all the hosts of Mordor couldn't keep us apart. Do you really think I'd let a river stand in my way of getting to you?"" Merry swallowed. ""Pippin, so many are lost, nearly twenty dead. I-I-"" Suddenly his grief poured forth, and the tears he'd been holding at bay for days finally came. Gently, Pippin wrapped his arms around his beloved cousin, and wept with him. This-this was what Merry had truly needed him for. 0o0o0o0 Months later Pippin wiped the sweat from his brow, and looked around at the mountains of boxes and bundles waiting to be loaded onto a cart for transport to the Great Smials. Crickhollow looked strangely bare; the furniture remained, but all the things that had shown a family lived there, the pictures and cushions and books and toys and other mathoms, were gone. He suppressed a small feeling of guilt; even after all these weeks of effort, and all that had been done to restore Buckland, he sometimes felt guilty that Crickhollow had suffered so little damage: a tree down, some need of re-thatching, a bit of water in the root cellar. So many hobbits of Buckland had lost everything. But he had seen Merry through with the restoration, and now Buckland was beginning to get back to normal. Too many of the buildings still looked brand new, and the harvest was not going to be as abundant, but the recovery was well underway. The help sent by King Elessar and by Éomer of Rohan had made certain that none would go hungry, nor remain homeless. And now Pippin needed to return to the Great Smials and prepare to take up the Thainship, for his cousin Opal had said that Paladin would be fortunate to live until the next Spring. ""Pippin!"" Merry's voice called from the front. ""I'm coming, Merry!"" he called. Diamond and the children were already on their way. They would cross the newly re-built Bridge and await him at the Inn there. Merry stood there with their ponies; he'd ride with Pippin as far as the bridge. Pippin locked the door to the little house and handed Merry the key. ""I'm going to miss all the good times we had here."" ""I know."" Merry's eyes roved over the small house, where they had both lived for so many years after their return. ""Did you leave the axe?"" Merry's voice was grave. The crisis of the flood had left its mark on him as much as had the Quest, and he was solemn more than he used to be. Pippin nodded. ""It's in the rafters of the attic."" ""Good."" For one edict that the Master of Buckland had made, as each new cot was built or smial dug out, as each old one was repaired and re-thatched: every dwelling was to have an ax in the attic or under the rafters. End Notes: This story was originally written and posted on my LiveJournal on Oct. 3, 2005, not long after Hurricane Katrina. It was in response to the overwhelming friendship and generosity showed by many of my online friends, who had created an LJ community called ""Hobbit Aid"" to raise funds to help me and another friend after the storm. I usually edit my stories heavily before posting. This story was a catharsis, and I posted it raw. I keep it that way since it just feels right to me that I shared my emotions as they came to me. There are any number of references to some of my previous stories here, and I have not tried to footnote them at all. Please feel free to ask if something puzzles you. The axe in the attic relates to something my husband told me after Hurricane Katrina. One of his elderly patients had been a contractor who had helped rebuild the Gulf Coast after the devastation of Hurricane Camille. He told my husband some stories about it. Because of the fact that so many had died in that manner-trapped in attics-just as they did with this storm-he insisted that any home or building that he helped to build or restore be furnished with an axe in the attic, so that at least someone forced to take refuge that way would have a way to chop themselves an escape to the rooftop. In my story, it only takes a few months for Buckland to begin its recovery. In reality, it is going to take years for the Gulf Coast to recover from the ravages of Hurricane Katrina. But to even begin to recover would not be possible without all the help being given by kind friends like all of you. I thank you so very, very much. More than any material assistance, just the knowledge that you were caring and thinking of us made the world of difference. I want to give extra special thanks to Llinos, Marigold, Budgielover, Pippinfan, Grey Wonderer, and Anso the Hobbit for the reminders sent to me by snail mail and for the help and support over the phone when it finally came up. But to everyone on my friends list, and to everyone who took part in Hobbit Aid, my thanks as well. I love you all."
137,2,46,2-dreamflower02-46.txt,lord-of-the-rings,dreamflower02,"quite an enthusiasm for the event, and was excited and worried by turns. But Merry had not really thought it would keep him from coming at Yule, and for a few seconds he indulged himself in ill-temper and a bit of unbecoming jealousy. But his good nature reasserted itself quickly. Of course Pippin was excited over being an uncle, and was worried for his sister. And Merry was very fond of Pimpernel himself. He chuckled ruefully-how silly he was, to be jealous of a wee babe who was not even born yet! Would it be a lad or a lass? he wondered. Perhaps after Yule, he'd accompany Frodo back to Bag End, and they could both go to the Great Smials and meet the new addition to the family. First Yule, S.R. 1416 It's taking forever! Pippin thought. He sat down once more, right at the edge of the settee, his ears strained for the sounds behind the closed door between the sitting room and the bedroom. He heard another heart-felt moan from his sister, and jumped up again, pacing to the window to look out at the clear night. It had been hours and hours. In a few moments it would be midnight, and Second Yule. He bit his lip, and went over to the hearth, where he picked up the poker, and jabbed at the fire, causing sparks to fly up the chimney, and the log to break in two. He reached down and placed a new one on the fire. ""Pippin!"" Paladin too, was anxious, and Pippin's fidgeting was getting on his nerves. ""Sorry, Father."" He went over and sat down once more, still tightly wound, and ready to spring up again at any moment. ""Why can't we go in and see her?"" ""Son, the only male who needs to be in there is Pimmie's husband. She would not even take notice of us! And Mistress Poppy has all the help she needs, between your mother, and Milo's mother, and Pearl and Pervinca and her apprentice."" Paladin sighed. ""They would all only yell at us to 'get out!' and rightfully so."" ""I suppose."" He got up again. It was Yule. He could have been at Brandy Hall with Merry and Frodo. Pimmie had told him that he needn't feel obliged to be here when she gave birth-had found it rather amusing that he thought he needed to be. But good heavens! a chap didn't become an uncle for the first time every day. Now, however, he found himself wishing he had listened. It was awful, this waiting about, and every so often hearing his sister cry out. If it was so painful, it made him wonder why lasses ever wanted to have babies. It's a wonder there were ever any new little hobbits! A few hours earlier, he'd gone with his father to the main hall, for the lighting of the Yule log. They'd not stayed for the festivities-the Tooks understood why. All the Great Smials were eagerly awaiting the arrival of the Thain's first grandchild. Pippin winced, as he heard Pimmie giving another groan. The door to the sitting room opened, and he looked over in relief to see his Aunts Primrose and Peridot enter. Auntie Prim went over to her brother, and she and Paladin conversed in low tones. Aunt Peridot came over and stood by him. She gave him a little kiss on the cheek. ""Is everything all right, Pippin?"" she asked gently. ""I don't know,"" said Pippin. ""It seems to be taking ever so long! I hate this waiting about!"" She smiled at him. ""I've an idea, my dear."" She walked over to the shelves near the fireplace, and picked up her lap harp, and Pippin's fiddle and bow. Pippin's face brightened at the thought of music, and she handed the fiddle to him. In only a few moments they were playing ""Light the Yule Log"", and followed it by ""No Shorter Now Will Grow the Days"", ""Wassail, Wassail"" and other seasonal tunes. Pippin felt himself relax as he made music with his aunt. Just as they were finishing ""It is the Turning of the Year"", they heard another sharp cry from the bedroom, followed by the lusty wail of a baby. Pippin stopped playing and grinned. The door opened, and his mother came out, looking tired but happy. ""It's a lass!"" she said. There was much cheering in the sitting room. Paladin turned to Pippin. ""Son, would you like to go make the announcement in the main hall?"" Nodding, Pippin dashed out and ran all the way. After the cheering and back-slapping had died down, he returned wearily to the family apartments, where most everyone was now in the sitting room except for Milo. Pervinca was asleep in a chair, and on the settee, Paladin had his arm about an exhausted Eglantine. He looked up as Pippin came in. ""Would you like to meet your new niece, son?"" He gestured to the other room with his chin. Almost shyly, Pippin tapped at the door, and entered diffidently at Milo's greeting. Pimmie lay in the bed looking pale and a bit disheveled, but happy, with a blanket-wrapped bundle in her arms. Milo, who had been sitting at the edge of the bed stood up. ""Come and meet little Flora, Pippin,"" he said softly. Pippin went over to the bed, and Pimmie pulled back the blanket. He looked at the tiny red face, topped with a few downy reddish-gold curls. No doubt they would darken soon enough. His sister smiled at him. ""I heard your playing, through the door. It really helped, and made me feel better, Pip."" He smiled at her, gratified. ""Did it? I'm ever so glad, Pimmie, if it did."" ""Would you like to hold her?"" Pippin nodded, and Milo bent over and picked up his daughter, placing her carefully in Pippin's arms. Pippin smiled down at the sleeping little one. ""Happy Yule, Flora."" *A reference to my story ""The Dare"""

Those words of Gandalf from so many years ago rang in his mind as clearly as if the wizard was sitting next to him. He recalled how often Bilbo had said of Frodo that he was the best hobbit in the Shire. He realised that in spite of Frodo's ignorance of the world beyond the Shire and the dangers they faced, he saw in him all those qualities of great spirit that he'd seen in Bilbo. Aragorn searched his own heart, and understood his pledge was not born of an impulse to comfort a frightened hobbit, but out of knowing in his heart it was the right thing to do. The journey to Rivendell was likely to prove perilous and difficult. He hoped he would be able to guide these young innocents there without mishap. And he earnestly wished they would encounter Gandalf along the way. V. Cormallen, Spring, TA 3019 This was the day he had awaited for two weeks. So often he had second guessed his decision not to follow after Frodo and Sam, leaving them to pursue their impossible quest alone. When he had seen their battered forms borne by the Eagles out of the Black Land, he thought his heart would burst with terror and sorrow. If they had died, victory would have been but ashes, and he did not think he would have had the heart to claim his throne. But now he sat between the Prince of Dol Amroth and the new King of Rohan, acknowledged a king by this victorious host even though he would not be crowned until they returned to Minas Tirith. He gazed out over the ranks of soldiers who had made between them a path upon which three figures walked amidst the clamor of cheers: one tall and gleaming white, the other two small and clad in scorched rags. His heart twisted at the sight of them, gaunt still, after their long deprivation. Yet Gandalf had insisted they first appear to the host this way rather than the finery Aragorn had arranged for them, a symbol of all they had sacrificed to accomplish their task. Closer and closer they came, and Aragorn could now distinguish their features. Frodo looked almost frightened, but Sam was gazing about with astonishment writ upon his honest face. Aragorn laid aside the sword, and stared at Gandalf. They locked eyes and Gandalf could hear his voice inside his head: 'A little body doth often harbour a great soul.' They shared a moment together of pride in these two great souls. He grinned at the instant that recognition dawned upon the two hobbits. Frodo began to run, and so did Sam. They ran right up to him, delight in their eyes. Frodo just stared, but Sam looked up. ""Well, if that isn't the crown of all! Strider, or I'm still asleep!"" He looked down fondly. ""Yes, Sam, Strider. It is a long way, is it not, from Bree, where you did not like the look of me? A long way for us all but yours has been the darkest road."" He knelt before them, and drew in a deep breath, and reached out to take their hands gently. He blinked back tears at the sight of Frodo's still bandaged hand, and then led them to the throne of grass upon which he had been seated, and he lifted each one up and placed them upon it. They stared at him, eyes wide as saucers, and he laughed. Then he turned and in a mighty voice proclaimed: ""Praise them with great praise!"" -oo000oo- *Two Rivers is my own invention: a fortified town located in The Angle between the Bruinen (Loudwater) River and the Mithiethel (Hoarwell) River, southwest of Rivendell. **In my story ""Trotter"", posted at this site. Author's Notes: Vignettes based on these entries in the Tale of Years- The second vignette is an invention. I. 2956: Aragorn meets Gandalf (SR 1356) III. 3001: The watch is doubled on the Shire (SR 1401) IV. 3018: Aragorn meets the four hobbits in Bree, and gives Frodo his allegiance. (SR 1401) V. And on this passage in RotK, Book VI, Chapter IV, ""The Field of Cormallen""- And so the red blood blushing in their faces and their eyes shining with wonder, Frodo and Sam went forward and saw that amidst the clamorous host were set three high-seats built of green turves. Behind the seat upon the right floated, white on green, a great horse running free; upon the left was a banner, silver upon blue, a ship swan-prowed faring on the sea; but behind the highest throne in the midst of all a great standard was spread in the breeze, and there a white tree flowered upon a sable field beneath a shining crown and seven glittering stars. On the throne sat a mail-clad man, a great sword was laid across his knees, but he wore no helm. As they drew near he rose. And then they knew him, changed as he was, so high and glad of face, kingly, lord of Men, dark-haired with eyes of grey. Frodo ran to meet him, and Sam followed close behind. 'Well, if that isn't the crown of all!' he said. 'Strider, or I'm still asleep!' 'Yes, Sam, Strider,' said Aragorn. 'It is a long way, is it not, from Bree, where you did not like the look of me? A long way for us all but yours has been the darkest road.' And then to Sam's surprise and utter confusion he bowed his knee before them; and taking them by the hand, Frodo upon his right and Sam upon his left, he led them to the throne, and setting them upon it, he turned to the men and captains who stood by and spoke, so that his voice rang over all the host, crying: 'Praise them with great praise!'"
139,2,34,2-dreamflower02-34.txt,lord-of-the-rings,dreamflower02,"sleeping as soundly as Sam Gamgee ever had. xxxxxxx In the public room of the inn, the pipers had gathered. They were mostly having a good time with the ale, and with talking to one another. The older pipers, Ferdinand Took, Wil Cotton and Denham Banks were sitting at a table together, and comparing the worst students on the pipes they had ever had. Only Gil Chubb was sitting by himself, drinking ale after ale, and staring glumly at the door to the inn's private room, where he had watched the Thain and his family, the Master of Buckland and his family, the Mayor, and Sam Gamgee and his wife go in. After a while they all came out, and made their separate ways to their rooms. Rufus Tunnelly had brought with him a cask of his own brew, rather stronger than what the inn usually served, and persuaded the innkeeper, his second cousin once removed, to allow him to broach it. It was dark and rich and heady. Lott Brockhouse was telling a story about the first time he had heard Pippin play, when he was just a young tween, there was a chorus of toasts to ""Captain Peregrin"" and then another to ""Captain Merry"". Then there was another chorus of toasts to the Travellers and to the new King they would be meeting on the morrow. Carl Roper called for a toast to Samwise Gamgee, who had made the Shire green again. As all the rest drained their tankards, Gil Chubb shoved his away, muttering ""Nothing but a gardener, married to a jumped-up farmer's daughter, pretending he's gentry-"" Unfortunately his mutters came during a lull in the conversations, and was all too clear to the rest in the room. He suddenly found Jolly Cotton staring at him, inches from his face. ""What did you just say?"" xxxxxxx There was a persistent knocking at his door. Pippin opened one eye muzzily, and took in the fact that he was neither at the Great Smials nor Crickhollow-ah, yes, was it morning already? He glanced out the window; dawn was peeping in. ""I'm awake!"" he called. Merry stuck his head in the door. His face was serious. ""Pip. We have a problem."" xxxxxxx Pippin looked at the row of pipers standing before him, each and every one of them obviously in the grip of miserable hangovers. Gil Chubb had a black eye and a swollen nose. Jolly had a lump on his brow not at all concealed by his mop of curls. ""What am I going to do with the lot of you?"" he asked angrily. ""The King will be here at noon, and we are to meet him on the bridge. Forget about second breakfast, we are going to practice, now!"" ""Captain Pippin,"" moaned Jolly, ""I'm not sure I could eat breakfast if I had it."" At the second mention of breakfast, Hildibold Took and Marco Goodbody bolted for the door. They barely made it outside before they could be heard being noisily sick. Pippin looked at Merry. ""What happened?"" he asked miserably. Merry rolled his eyes. ""Rufus Tunnelly's home brew and Gil Chubb's big mouth."" Pippin glared at Chubb. He should have known. ""What did he say?"" Carl aimed a venomous look at the subdued Chubb. ""He insulted Sam and Rosie."" Pippin turned bright red with anger. He walked over to Gil Chubb. ""So you found something to say about our Sam and Rosie, did you?"" he yelled right into the hung over hobbit's face. Chubb flinched. ""I'm sorry, Mr. Pippin."" he whined, ""It was the ale as was talking."" ""You'd better be sorry! And you'd better play your heart out today to make up for it!"" ""Ooh, my head!"" the hapless Chubb moaned. xxxxxxx Two hours later, Pippin sank down dismally on a bench by the inn door. They were terrible. They were awful. He'd never heard pipers sound worse. And these were supposed to be the best pipers in the Shire. They had stumbled as they tried to march. Once, Marco, Hildibold and Lott had marched in the opposite direction than everyone else. And they would get halfway through a song, and just fade out one at a time. They could not keep the rhythm. All of Pippin's nightmares seemed about to come true. Merry sat down by him sympathetically. ""Maybe you should just play for Aragorn, and leave the others out of it."" Pippin moaned. He might just have to do that. He felt an abject sense of failure. His father had entrusted him with an important task, put him in charge of this, and he had messed it all up. Merry patted him on the back sympathetically, for once at a loss as to what else was to be done. ""Pippin-"" Pippin looked up to see Sam, Rose and Diamond standing there. Rose had a tray with cups on it, and Sam and Diamond between them were carrying a good sized kettle. ""-I have some of the Gaffer's morning after remedy mixed up here. Bring 'em on over here, and we'll dose 'em."" ""Oh, Sam!"" Pippin's face lit up. ""You are a genius! And too kind, after that one's remarks!"" ""Well now, Mr.- I mean, Pippin, you know I'm not one to hold a grudge."" ""Besides,"" giggled Diamond, ""it's going to taste really nasty."" Rose grinned. ""And you know what finishes off the Gaffer's remedy!"" Pippin gave her an evil grin. Ah, yes! Cold water poured over the head. xxxxxxx King Elessar sat among those of his court who had traveled with him, and watched the twelve hobbits, as they piped and played and marched in precision. They sounded stirring and grand, and every time Pippin passed he caught his King's eye with a gleam of pride. He could not help but wonder, however at the story behind the obviously bruised faces on a couple of them, and why they all appeared to have wet heads. He grinned. He'd hear the tale sooner or later."

She could see in his eyes that he knew it was hopeless. ""Never,"" he said. He looked up at Nico, fifteen feet above. ""The other side, Nico! We'll see you there. Understand?"" Nico's eyes widened. ""But-"" ""Lead them there!"" Percy shouted. ""Promise me!"" ""I- I will."" Below them, the voice laughed in the darkness. Sacrifices. Beautiful sacrifices to wake the goddess. Percy tightened his grip on Annabeth's wrist. His face was gaunt, scraped and bloody, his hair dusted with cobwebs, but when he locked eyes with her, she thought he had never looked more handsome. ""We're staying together,"" he promised. ""You're not getting away from me. Never again."" Only then did she understand what would happen. A one-way trip. A very hard fall. ""As long as we're together,"" she said. She heard Nico and Hazel still screaming for help. She saw the sunlight far, far above- maybe the last sunlight she would ever see. Then Percy let go of his tiny ledge, and together, holding hands, he and Annabeth fell into the endless darkness. Annabeth was just supposed to teach Cabin 12, but some of the Aphrodite girls loved hearing Annabeth's stories so much that they came by on their own. Now they were angry that Annabeth was talking about Persephone getting kidnapped instead of love stories. ""You know, love stories in myths don't always have to be just love stories,"" Annabeth said. ""Sometimes the people who fall in love do other stuff."" ""Like who?"" A girl called Tonie said, throwing it out there like a challenge. ""Ariadne,"" Annabeth said strengthening her chin. ""You know, she saved Theseus' butt when he was facing the minotaur. But why'd she give him the yarn in the first place? Cause she loved him. And after that she helped him escape Thebes and she ran away with him."" ""Annabelle,"" a cold voice said. Annabeth spun around to spot Mr D. ""I suggest you tell the rest of that story very quickly or else I'll turn you into an oak like your little friend, to make your new ""Yeah,"" Annabeth swallowed. ""Sometimes people fall in love with people that aren't being rooted for. And sometimes people get hurt when they're just trying to get love."" She chewed on her lip as she looked at the kids in the cabin and her eyes landed on Luke. ""Yeah, sometimes things get messed up,"" Annabeth said. ""Is that what's wrong with this love story? Annabeth?"" Silena said quietly. ""It's what's wrong with all of them,"" Annabeth said after a while. ""Okay, that's enough for today. Go to, like, archery or something. Leave."" Most of the people obliged since, in the few days of summer, everybody was always itching to be outside. Luke stayed behind and he walked up to Annabeth and pushed on her shoulders before she even got to hop off the desk. ""Question,"" Luke said. ""No discussions, no bullshit, no big words- only answers from you. Kapiche?"" ""Yeah,"" Annabeth said. Luke swallowed. ""Why do you think that love gets messed up?"" he asked. Annabeth shrugged. ""Oh, please. I've known you since you were seven, and even before that, I wasn't dumb,"" Luke said. ""Be honest with me."" Annabeth swallowed. ""The only people I watched fall in love when my cognitive abilities were developed enough to understand it were…"" She shouldn't be telling him this, but she'd already given him enough pieces. ""Me and Thalia?"" Luke asked nodding and looking away. ""Don't get mad. I'm only saying the truth."" ""Yes I know, Annabeth, I know,"" Luke sighed. ""But… Annabeth, Thalia and I… I don't know if it was love kiddo, we never got real far with all of that."" Annabeth chewed on her lip and looked at Luke with big eyes. ""To me it was,"" Annabeth said. ""Okay,"" Luke said. ""Well, perception before reality and stuff."" ""I'm a child of Athena,"" Annabeth said. ""My life isn't normal and it never will be. I live in a thousand worlds at once and know a thousand places in history and in the world today I'll never be in. My perception is everything."" ""Annabeth, you… you're barely twelve, kid."" ""I am twelve."" ""Whatever, you just turned twelve,"" Luke said. ""You can't… you can't go around saying things like that about love."" ""Why? Because I'm not smart enough?"" Annabeth asked. ""No, because you didn't even give it a chance,"" Luke sighed. ""I don't want to,"" Annabeth said. ""That's the most terrifying thing I've ever heard you say,"" Luke said. She stuck her tongue out at him, but he didn't mean it as a joke. Annabeth chewed on her lip. After the last few days of her life had flashed past her in a flurry of numbness and racing action, she felt everything around her too brightly. She felt the setting sun shining against her skin. She heard the lake gushing. She heard the fire in the torches crackling. She felt splinters from Cabin 3's worn bench digging into her thighs. She felt her t-shirt, sticky against her back. She tasted chocolate cake in her mouth. She felt her heart race and everything in her get stuck in her throat. He was looking at her and she was looking at him and they both knew what was about to happen and they both knew who was going to have to say it first because who always said things first, here? And she'd been scared so stiff for the last five days of her life- battle after battle, explosion after explosion, mission after mission- but part of her fear had also been the oh-so-palpable reality of losing him. And how could she ignore that bit? When she stopped being afraid of getting hurt and started being afraid of losing him… She looped her arms around his neck. ""I will never make things easy for you, Seaweed Brain. Get used to it."""
141,3,10,3-HecateA-10.txt,percy-jackson-and-the-olympians,HecateA,"sisters and I are very good at fixing the messes,"" Miranda said. ""A baby bird!"" Lou Ellen looked up and spotted a baby bird, disgusting and pink. ""Hush, hush, baby,"" Miranda said slowly approaching the remnants of the nest. ""Hush…"" ""Don't pick it up, the mother won't come back,"" Lou Ellen said. ""That's a myth,"" Miranda said. ""The only bird with a developed sense of smell is the vulture, besides I don't think this little guy has a mother to go back to… And his wing is broken, oh… Okay, I need your help."" ""Me?"" ""Go to my cabin and check on the shelf near the door, there's a bunch of emergency shoeboxes and plastic bins. Find one about… this big, that's about the size of the original nest. There will be holes near the bottom, we put them there for drainage, it's normal. Grab one of our bird first aid kits too, they should be on the same shelf- make sure it's bird, not squirrel or rabbit or… Go, quick."" Lou Ellen went quickly. oOoOo ""You've got this surgical precision,"" Lou Ellen said as she watched Miranda wrap a sterile bandage over the broken wing, down the bird's side so it couldn't flap, and under the working wing. ""It's just because the bird's letting me,"" Miranda said. ""Yeah, well, the bird's letting you,"" Lou Ellen said. ""They always do,"" Miranda said. ""As long as they know it's because they're being loved, and because they are being cared for."" ""I know they do,"" Lou Ellen said, sinking into her thoughts. oOoOo ""Hey,"" Miranda said. ""Can you pass me the eyedropper? I think he might drink some more."" Lou Ellen was falling asleep with open eyes. Again. Just a bit this time, and Miranda helped her think. ""Wake up. Bailey needs you."" ""Bailey?"" ""That's the bird's name,"" Miranda said. ""Isn't it, little guy?"" ""How do you know it's not a girl?"" Lou Ellen said. ""Bailey's a unisex name,"" Miranda said. ""And I'm switching between little guy and baby girl and babe. I've got my bases covered."" Lou Ellen smiled. She loved Miranda. And Miranda loved the baby bird so much that she had hand-fed it for the last three hours and showed no signs of stopping. oOoOo ""We have to keep her warm,"" Miranda said, tucking some yarn into the baby bird (fine, Bailey )'s shoebox. ""She's just a nestling, see? Shouldn't be out of the nest, not even near old enough to fly… I'll show Katie when she comes over for spring break, but I think we'll be able to get her back in the woods if she keeps taking fluids…"" ""Is this what you always do?"" Lou Ellen said. ""Find little broken things and keep them?"" ""Sometimes,"" Miranda said. She looked up. ""Sometimes I also date extraordinary, beautiful women. Even if they think they're a charity case."" Lou Ellen's mouth opened. ""I care a lot about a lot of things, Ellie,"" Miranda said. ""It's made me a bit observant."" ""Don't tell me I'm wrong,"" Lou Ellen said. ""Is this because your siblings call me when you have your episodes?"" ""Don't call them that."" ""Then what are they?"" Miranda asked. ""I'm seriously asking here, that way I can use the right word. Or do the right thing. If I'm doing or saying something wrong."" ""You're not doing anything wrong,"" Lou Ellen sighed. ""You're perfect. You take care of me so much and so well and I'm so broken that I don't even remember it to thank you, and I don't remember anything about my… I guess they are episodes."" ""That's not the point, Ellie,"" Miranda said. ""To get thanks. I take care of you because I love you."" ""And what do I do because I love you?"" Lou Ellen said. ""Nothing. I do nothing, but I love you so much, Mira, so much it hurts sometimes. And you're so good, sometimes that's why I fall into these episodes because I'm so guilty and you don't even know it and you're too good to even ask or push and…"" ""I got to Camp when I was twelve, three months before you, and I didn't eat,"" Miranda said. Lou Ellen blinked. ""I didn't eat for, like, a week,"" Miranda said. ""And my mother's a bit of a food goddess, so maybe that's why it didn't do as much damage as it should've, but I couldn't eat because I was so scared. And the paranoia was so bad and with the hunger too, that I hallucinated birds and bugs everywhere around Camp. They were even in the showers. And when I finally ate I threw up and I couldn't keep anything down for another week, and then I thought that maybe I was being poisoned because like I said, I was kind of tripping. Katie spoon-fed me apple sauce in the infirmary with Will Solace smashing up multivitamins in the background, and that was my first meal at camp."" Miranda played with her hands before tucking in more yarn and newspaper into Bailey's makeshift nest. ""I notice a lot,"" Miranda said. ""Because I care. And I think that all demigods are a little bit damaged. And that might me an understatement because some of us are the most severely messed up people I know, but all of us at least have something going on. You weren't here when I was at my worst. I'm here now, and this is your worst. It's a coincidence. But I know that if I ever get bad again, or next time that I get hurt really bad, you'll be there. So you're not some charity case or adopted pet, and we're not building up debts here, Ellie. We're being in love."" ""I like being in love,"" Lou Ellen said. ""I do too,"" Miranda said. ""I also like saving baby birds in the wild, so you're going to have to let me do both without taking it personally…"" Lou Ellen laughed, leaned over Bailey's nest, and kissed her."
142,3,16,3-HecateA-16.txt,percy-jackson-and-the-olympians,HecateA,"into the car."" They wrapped it up in under two seconds, and Sally got into the car. Annabeth could tell that she was biting back a smile. ""Oh and by the way,"" Percy said rummaging in his backpack. He pulled out a biology test. ""95%. How's that for focused during the cram?"" Annabeth laughed and squeezed his hand. ""Congratulations. Wow, this really worked out great. We should do this again next year."" Percy's jaw dropped. Annabeth laughed nearly as hard as Sally. ""Don't fight her on this, Percy,"" Sally said. ""Especially once she sees days ten, eleven and twelve."" ""I get days ten, eleven and twelve too?"" Annabeth asked with a smile. ""What kind of a cheap jerk do you think I am?"" Percy scoffed, insulted. Annabeth laughed and rested her head on his shoulder in penance. He kissed her hair and they settled in for the ride. A month later ""How's your contract going?"" Annabeth asked, her hands unfolding from her mug of tea and reaching for a cookie. She enjoyed visiting Sally. She and Paul always had some new tea lying around and Annabeth had claimed her own mug from the array in their cupboards. Sally constantly had fresh baking in the house. Sally was as good at conversation as she was with silence, and sometimes the apartment was just a good place to curl up and read while Paul procrastinated on correction by pacing aimlessly, or while Sally joined Annabeth with her own paperwork. The best part was that she was always welcome to look up and ask a question or burst into a rant about anything. And Sally was perhaps one of the only people to understand what Annabeth was going through spare Grover, and she was so much easier to get in touch with. ""It's going well,"" Sally said pushing a lock of hair from her face. ""I finished revising the first draft before New Year's, and it's back in the author's hands now. I'm back to paperwork for the senior editors."" ""That's alright,"" Annabeth said. Sally nodded. ""It's a great job, even when I'm only doing photocopies. Beats retail, anyways. How's school going? Did you get that physics test back?"" ""Yeah, I blew it like I thought I did,"" Annabeth said biting her lip. ""It's not the end of the world. It's what you get when last period's substitute teacher was a dracanae. Who followed you into the bathroom during the break."" ""Honey, I'm sorry,"" Sally said holding out her hand. Annabeth took it and took a deep breath to secure herself. She was intelligent. She knew that. She had a critical spirit, her memory was amazing, she could puzzle out riddles, and her problem-solving skills were spot-on. But grades were hard. For all intents and purpose, Annabeth could cure cancer or build the eighth wonder of the world or become the next Socrates raddling out philosophy in the streets if she put her mind to it and worked her ass off. But the problem was the grades. The plague on children of Athena everywhere. If Annabeth spelled mitosis ""mitoiss"" on a test, or switched 42 for 24 in an equation on paper, she was toast. In her head she never made these mistakes, she knew what mitosis was and how it was called, but on paper everything was jumbled. She knew that it wasn't an excuse; that she had to work through her Greek-programing, but it was so scary to think that one day she may not be able to do what she'd always dreamed of, that the only people who considered her as smart as she was were the ones who could die at any point in time like her. It wasn't helping at all that they were slipping slowly but surely. Sometimes because of monsters, sometimes because of emergency quests within New York when Jason or Piper popped up in her dorm, sometimes because of the insomnia and worry that gnawed at her nearly constantly. ""I should be doing better,"" Annabeth said, turning her head. ""Listen to me here Annabeth, you are doing fine,"" Sally said. ""Especially given the circumstances…"" Annabeth tugged at her curls. ""We just wanted one Christmas,"" Annabeth said pathetically. ""Annabeth, they would've taken him from the apartment if not from camp, and then it would've taken even longer to realise that something was wrong,"" Sally reasoned. ""Logically I know,"" Annabeth said. ""But I… We haven't had one restful summer since we turned twelve, it would've been nice to have a nice Christmas. We could've eaten until we felt like throwing up. Had snowball fights with everybody else. Jesus, sometimes Miranda Gardner follows couples around and sprouts mistletoe over their heads. We could've just swapped presents and watched old movies. It would've been such a nice break... He didn't even get to finish days ten, eleven and twelve, and he was so fucking proud of himself."" She didn't swear much in front of Sally. Percy had told her once that it reminded Sally of Gabe sometimes, and Annabeth knew what a pain triggers were. Percy and Paul only swore back and forth at each other when Sally wasn't home to get it out of their systems. But she was so tired. Sally switched spots on the couch and wrapped her arms around Annabeth. ""I think you'll be okay,"" Sally said quietly, kissing her hair. ""And you know what?"" ""What?"" Annabeth asked quietly. ""I think that a bad Christmas makes a good Christmas great,"" she said. ""Just you wait until next year, Annabeth. Just you wait."" And Sally's smile was so kind and promising and honest, that Annabeth couldn't help but take a deep breath, smile and believe her. ""I guess I can give him his Christmas present on his birthday,"" Annabeth said. ""That's the spirit,"" Sally said. Paul, dodging some particularly unpleasant ninth grader essays to correct by cleaning bathrooms, strolled by with some Windex in hand and hummed: ""Fa la la la la, la la la la."""

Geez, how did you talk Leo into that?"" ""I don't threaten to kill him once a month,"" Annabeth said. ""Fuck the fucking hell off. Come on Hazel!"" Hazel smiled and took Piper's hand so they stood on Annabeth's bed, jumping as they danced. It may have looked more like a vertical seizure to a bystander, but they were laughing and bouncing and shrieking out song lyrics- and as long as you couldn't see yourself, it didn't matter how crazy you looked, right? Unfortunately Leo could see them, so when he knocked on the door and wandered in looking for an extra cable Annabeth had borrowed… ""Fellas,"" Leo screamed over his shoulder. ""Forget all the self-pitying I've done. I'm okay with being the single hot one."" Piper threw a book at his face. ""This wouldn't be happening if you hadn't stolen my breakfast waffle and wrecked my mood for the day!"" Piper said. ""This is great,"" Hazel said as she drifted off the dance floor for the first time that night, a smile plastered across her face. ""Yeah, the Romans were known for their festivals,"" Frank said. ""I think the Senate was trying to outshine Cabin 12's parties from earlier in the summer."" Hazel smiled and nodded. It was probably the first time that Frank ever seen her in a dress. Only a certain rank was allowed to wear true Roman ceremonial dress at special occasions, so for this evening Hazel had rallied Piper and Annabeth and they'd found a soft yellow dress with straps just wide enough for Hazel to pin her medals onto. She'd tied a white ribbon around her waist, Frank had no idea why, but she could pull it off. She looked exhilarated, her face split by a smile. She'd let her hair down ages ago but she was still standing tall in her heels. Frank felt like he was going on and on, painting a picture of Hazel in his head, when in reality the bottom line was simply that she looked beautiful. ""The DJ is great,"" Hazel said. ""Piper was right, Beyoncé is the queen. That's what people call her, right? And the children of Apollo- they are not messing around on the dance floor. I think I even saw a few Greeks crashing the reception! You should come."" ""On the dance floor?"" Frank asked. ""Yeah,"" Hazel said. ""I better not,"" Frank said. ""Oh come on,"" Hazel said. ""Just because you get to come in your shiny armour doesn't mean that you're in charge of security or anything for the night. Even Reyna got the cue! She's enjoying the night off."" ""That's because Reyna can dance,"" Frank said. ""True. The hips on that girl- wait,"" Hazel said. ""Wait a second, are you insinuating that you don't dance?"" ""Hazel, I'm a clutz. It's gotten a bit better since I joined the legion and started shapeshifting, but I don't dance,"" Frank said. Hazel's jaw dropped. ""Frank Zhang!"" Hazel said. ""Dancing is the first thing the cavemen did to entertain themselves on late nights around the fire. Dancing is the way a lord would court a lady in between dragon slaying and dying of the plague. Dancing is how people shouted into the void and told stories without being told to shut up. How can you say you do not dance?"" ""Umm…"" Frank said. ""Did you know that in South Africa they made a style of dance called gumboots because abused miners wouldn't be allowed to talk to each other by white bigshot bosses- so they'd tap on their boots and stomp to communicate, then they realised that they could dance it?"" Hazel said. ""Did you know that nobody knows for sure why Irish dancers keep their upper bodies so still while they dance, but some say that it was to avoid bowing to English lords when Ireland was under their occupation? Did you know that-"" ""Whoa, whoa, whoa,"" Frank said. ""You're rambling. Your Louisiana is coming out."" Hazel took a deep breath and huffed. A piece of hair floated away from her face. ""My point is…"" Hazel said. Her accent had deflated somewhat. ""How do you not know how to dance? I mean… anyone can dance."" Frank shrugged. ""Mom taught me to skate when I could walk, signed me up for Timbits and that was the extent of the athletics expected from me."" ""Very few of those words make sense,"" Hazel said. ""Okay, but you call soda 'cold drinks' and that's weirder,"" Frank said. She grabbed his hands and pulled him to his feet, which happened when he forgot how strong she actually was. ""Hazel, this is not going to go well,"" Frank said nervously. ""Frank,"" she said. She put her hands on his arms. ""Frank, folks who didn't have a lot, especially coloured folks, we didn't have a whole lot of entertainment either where I grew up. But we could always dance, and it was so fun, and I have waited a long time to do it again. And I never even thought I'd have a dance partner again. Much less someone like you."" Frank looked at her with that strange look he had- like he didn't know what to do with her, but he was also looking at Hazel like he saw every inch of her crystal clearly. Then he held his hand out to her. It hung in the air for a second. ""Is that how you invite someone to dance?"" Frank asked nervously. ""It is in the movies."" ""That's how we do it now,"" Hazel nodded. She didn't want him to think she was making fun of him, but she couldn't bite back her smile. ""It's a future thing."" ""As is the Soldier Boy,"" Frank said. ""Oh, shut up and dance with me,"" Hazel laughed. He'd given her his hand, now she could freely drag him to the dance floor."

Because you were the first to really, really do that. That was so new to me, I didn't know how to manage it. Well, I did. I'd seen it done. I guess it just wasn't my first instinct and we were a bit short on time. I'm sorry."" Jason nodded, and he watched the sun rise and bounce off the snow a bit more. ""Jessa wanted to know why we were making so much noise,"" Jason said. ""She wants to meet you. And then she wants to open Christmas presents. Come on."" Leo's heart dropped, and it started up again as the smile sprawled across his face. Hell, maybe it even grew three sizes. Jason and Leo went to go grab breakfast for the four of them, leaving Piper to pick up the wrapping paper and colourful tissue paper laying on the floor and on Jessica's sheets. Now Piper was braiding Jessa's hair and chatting with her, which was by far one of her favourite things to do in the whole wide world. Except when her four-year-old went all metaphysical and existentialist and deep before 9:00 AM. ""Mommy?"" Jessica asked. ""Yes baby?"" ""Why don't I know Uncle Leo like Uncle Percy and Aunt Annabeth and Uncle Frank and Aunt Hazel and Aunt Reyna and Uncle Nico and Uncle Will and Aunt Gwen and Uncle Dakota and Uncle Bobby and Uncle Mitchell and Uncle Malcolm and Aunt Lacy and all them?"" Jessica asked. Leo's omission from that list was painful enough, but having to justify that to a four year old child? Then again, Piper had held Jessica during nights when she'd been sick and trembling until the early morning. Piper had had to tell Jessica that her blood was sick and that it was a bit their fault. Piper had to leave her daughter every time she saw her, and Jessica always, always cried as Jason and Piper pulled each other away from the Big House (because if it wasn't for each other's sakes they'd be holding their little girl and screaming and crying too). Piper had had to tell Jessica that she may die if she didn't take her medicine or wear her oxygen mask or let Chiron and the medics give her injections and work their magic. There were much, much worst things to have to tell a child- and Piper had found that the truth was always the best. Even when it sucked, the truth was mostly around to stare you straight in the eyes. Even when she was dressing Jessica in her pretty Christmas dress - a red and black checked shirt with a soft red top- she'd come across scars on Jessica's belly and ports for IVs and bruising from dialysis. There was no point in lying. ""He's been away,"" Piper said. ""Is that why you're angry, Mommy?"" Jessica asked. ""I'm not angry with Uncle Leo,"" Piper said. And that was the truth. Piper was... dissapointed, in a way. Well, it wasn't the entire truth. She was a little angry. And the fact that Leo hadn't expected that... Maybe that was dissapointment again, however? She'd thought she knew this boy and that he knew her back. She'd thought they were friends. Friends knew each other. Friends didn't leave each other. Friends didn't miss the biggest, baddest parts of each others' lives. ""That's good,"" Jessica said as Piper tied off her braid with a red elastic. ""Chiron read me a story about how Christmas is magical and about love and joy and being with people and forgiving. That's what he said it was about."" ""What was the story called?"" Piper asked. She felt as if a thousand boulders were shifting across her stomach. "" How the Grinch Stole Christmas,"" Jessica said. ""Can you read it later to me Mommy?"" ""Absolutely,"" Piper agreed. The door was pushed open. Leo came in holding plates all over his arms like a waiter. ""Daddy Jay said you liked waffles, Jessica,"" Leo said. ""Is that true?"" Jessica sat up in bed happily and clapped her hands, a smile across her toothy face. Piper smiled a bit too, and she didn't stop as they spread a picnic blanket on Jessica's bed and set up breakfast. This was how they always ate their meals with Jessica, and Leo seemed to fold into the routine as if he'd been an ingredient all along. It calmed Piper down a bit, to see him so naturally... at ease with Jessica, despite the wires and tubes and pills that Jason portioned out with her meal. He passed the syrup and offered to cut Jessica's second helping of waffles so that Piper could eat and he teased Jessica about how Santa Claus wasn't above return policies and so she should really eat her fruit... It gave Piper a bit of hope, too. Even if he'd been away for so long, even if he wasn't perfect, even if he was still a little bit selfish and a whole lot of awkward, even if he'd missed the hardest moments of Piper's life and of Jessica's diagnosis and treatment and medical scares... maybe there was hope for all of them yet. Maybe it wasn't too late for Leo to be in their busy, tumultuous, agitated lives. In their little broken family, held together by sheer willpower and pure love. Hope. That was something else that Chiron had forgotten to tell Jessica that Christmas was about. Piper would have to tell her later, when they read the story. Perhaps if Piper made a Grinch voice, that Jason read the bits about the dog- maybe Leo could sing like the whoos in Whooville and make Jessica laugh. She'd like that. They all would. ""Thank you Leo,"" she said. Let us all rejoice again On Christmas day, on Christmas day Let us all rejoice again On Christmas day in the morning"
145,3,13,3-HecateA-13.txt,percy-jackson-and-the-olympians,HecateA,"everywhere and the next it was just darkness, you have no idea…"" She barked and licked his cheeks and Percy took a good, good deep breath. Hey. He could breathe again. Annabeth helped him add a message in white Sharpie on Cleo's blue service dog vest: DO NOT SEPERATE ME FROM MY OWNER EVER. As if that wasn't obvious enough as it was. Zeus, people were dumb and insensitive and too curious and incredibly dumb about service animals sometimes. Don't touch. Don't ask, because it's none of your business unless you know the person affected. Don't pry. Don't interfere. Don't. Touch. While at Camp, Percy found out something else that was wickedly cool about Cleo. She could bring down a two-hundred pound child of Ares if he came at Percy from behind in the sword rink. She could, and she most certainly did. Like, what was Percy supposed to do other than pat her on the head and wonder if Cleo was maybe an abandoned or retired K-9 dog or possibly a massive ass gift from the deepest, purest part of Olympus? (Feed the dog a humongous steak and a small pile of marshmallows at supper, that was what). ""Hey, Cleo, you know what?"" Percy asked. ""You know what, girl?"" He was using the voice that made her extra-extra excited just because he could. Her tail was about to helicopter-torpedo fly off of her butt. ""We're going to try sleeping without the nightlight on today,"" Percy said. ""Yeah. Yeah we are. It's gonna be dark, but not too bad right girl?"" Cleo's butt kept wagging around. Having a dog was like a perma-cheerleader. ""Right,"" Percy said. ""Just… stay close, okay girl?"" Cleo did stay close. She never left Peryc's side. Unless he asked her to stay at home while he ran a little errand, or when he flew to Camp via Pegasus and decided to give her a weekend off instead of subjecting her to the traumatic experience of flying… (also he was scared that she and Blackjack may be able to communicate and then gang up on him) On Percy's graduation day -which, it's worth mentioning, was a miracle all in itself- Percy was woken up by Cleo bouncing on the bed excitedly. It took him a while to sit up, acknowledge his lucidity, focus his eyes, and realise that Cleo was so hyper because of… a hat? ""We made it for her,"" Mom said, just as happy as Cleo. ""We figured; well, if you're graduating, and she's graduating- then she needs to wear a graduation cap when she walks across the stage with you, right?"" Percy looked at Cleo once and then laughed. (And then spent the next twenty minutes being ultra-vigorous as he pet her to make sure that he hadn't hurt his dog, his beautiful dog's, ego). As it turned out, Reyna was rich. Filthy rich. So filthy rich that she disgusted herself. This was mostly because her father had been filthy rich before he died, but also because Hylla had used her resources as Queen of the Amazons to sell the house in San Juan. And even more so because Hylla didn't want a single dollar of her inheritance and had therefore transferred it to Reyna- who hadn't known it existed and hadn't needed it, ergo letting an enormous sum of money collect a ridiculous amount of interest in what could only be called a beautiful accident. Reyna didn't want the money either at first. She and Rachel had commiserated for a bit. But then Reyna did what Reyna did best; she turned pain and blood into something worthwhile. She bought a huge property in California, south of Camp Jupiter, and made copious sacrifices to Iris to connect the land to Camp Half-Blood. She built a huge fence circling the land, a modest house on it, and an impressive dog kennel to match. She shopped around shelters in San Francisco and San Juan and New York alike, and picked up any dogs that Aurum and Argentum didn't hate on site. She gave jobs to angsty half-bloods and legacies who weren't fit for legion work and to Greek demigods who needed more than camp to survive. Nico di Angelo did her taxes with her. Percy Jackson and Gwen were the veterinarians on call. Jason spent most of his time there and did groceries weekly, to the point that the pet store owners knew him as he came. They also recognised the old, reliable golden retriever who always walked at his side; Marcus. Reyna housed around 50 dogs at a time, and every month there was a new, rehabilitated stray who was ready to meet his new half-blood owner. The Stoll brothers took care of the paperwork, which was the only truly sketchy part about ""Canis Olympia"", but Reyna's dogs mysteriously appeared in data banks as certified service animals. When a blinded half-blood stumbled into Camp Half-Blood, there was a dog ready to act as her eyes and her nose only seven months later. That was Aggie, but the list was long. Annabeth's Oliver, Hazel's Ruby, Will's Lux, Katie's Holly… The dogs kept coming, and they kept going, and there kept being this incredible demand for them. Eventually, to continue receiving income for food and clothes and such, Reyna started training dogs for mortals as well. It was Thanksgiving, now. Summer had just ended, and it'd been a crazy blitz of incoming half-bloods and the administrative mess of matching dogs and owners. There were now only thirteen dogs on her land; this was Reyna's time to breathe. Well, nearly. Most of the guests had dogs. Oliver, Ruby, Lux, Marcus, Bones, Sabina and Helen were currently all jumping and prancing as their owners finished up dinner. Oh, and Cleo. Cleo had started it all, and so it was only normal that she was the one who came out of this with a thousand new friends and a bunch of new Frisbees to play with every time she visited."

And so the reason that prototype seven failed? Malcolm was a chicken. Successful Patent When Gaia's army retreated under the white flag that one of their undead generals produced, Malcolm felt like lying down on the battlefield and taking a nap. But he kept moving, finding all the Athena campers he could and taking a toll and accounting for everybody- which included two deaths, John and Anastasia. He kept moving. He had to get back to the tent where the other cabin counselors and centurions would be planning while their second-in-commands took care of the rest. The first battle had been rough. Gaia may have been the one to retreat, but that was only because of the lethal canons that Leo Valdez had managed to supply them with. The losses had been more heavy on their sides, and if a white flag hadn't been produced that moment… Malcolm kept walking. He'd lost a grieve sometime during the combat, probably after the lines had folded and it'd become a free-for-all. His thoughts were spinning- okay, the canons had come out. How much Greek fire had been used? How were the seven progressing, fighting the bigger giants in Greece? Had the Romans exhausted their supply of ballista ammunition? Were their losses too great for their formations to be as effective? He was mostly centered on his own thoughts, but as he kept walking he registered some things. A tiny eleven year old's body being picked off the battlefield- Tessa, she wasn't even claimed. She'd showed up at camp yesterday and hadn't even been supposed to be here. She must have sneaked into one of the vans or climbed a Pegasus... A tiny holographic icon of Aegis, the shield, appeared over Tessa's cracked skull. A lesser known symbol of Athena- but not of Athena, goddess of wisdom. Athena, goddess of heroism. Malcolm pretended he hadn't seen that and kept walking. The injured everywhere, some dragging themselves to the first aid tents when they couldn't walk and others laying there, incapable of anything until the medics got down to them, in order of priority. Katie Gardner, whose wrist was broken, was going to them with a water bottle. Broken weapons littered the fields. Demigods were flocking to the first aid and cafeteria tents, some of them supporting injured friends or bringing bodies with them. Mitchell was walking back towards the battlefield, probably to pick up more people. Malcolm offered a weak smile and Mitchell returned it. He spotted the brightness of that smile from twenty feet away. Then out of nowhere a heavy, whistling sound broke through the air and everyone looked up. ""COVER YOURSELVES!"" Malcolm yelled as some other counselors and half-bloods also yelled to get down. Soaring across the sky and breaking the white flag's most sacred meaning as demigods wandered around exhausted and injured and unarmed, came something that looked like a rocket blaster. But when it landed, Malcolm's legs collapsed under him and he didn't have time to make sure that the ones around him were covered. There was a blast like a bomb and a plume of smoke rose from where the bomb landed. Right next to Mitchell. ""No!"" Malcolm said leaping up to his feet. He didn't worry about chemical exposure or an aftershock, he just ran blindly towards Mitchell. Luckily the aim of the bomb had been off so there wasn't anybody else laying on the ground with their limbs at awkward angles and their eyes closed but Mitchell was. ""No, no, no,"" Malcolm said falling to his knees and sticking his fingers on Mitchell's neck for a pulse. He carefully moved Mitchell so that his head would be on his knees. ""No, no, no,"" he said. ""Mitchell. Mitchell, open your eyes. Mitchell, wake up."" Then he got angry. ""Listen to me you idiot,"" Malcolm said. ""Your skinny little ass can't die on me now. You have to hug Piper senseless when she gets back from Europe, and you have to stay alive until the second Avengers movie comes out because they say that Scarlett Johansson is pregnant in it and you love looking for stupid continuity errors or signs like that. And you have to finish that stupid book with the asinine sounding plot that you were reading and you have to get that degree in literature that you wanted and you have to stay alive until the next Christmas party to prove to me that you don't get drunk every time and for the love of all things good I haven't even had the courage to ask you out yet so wake up you idiot!"" He calmed himself down. Mitchell most likely couldn't hear him. He sounded like an idiot. He had to calm down. He had to get a medic or a shroud and figure out which one he needed. He had to calm down. He couldn't calm down. He had to start CPR or something… Then out of nowhere Mitchell groaned. ""There better be flowers on this date you're suggesting, here."" Once Malcolm had stopped hugging Mitchell with potentially rib-snapping strength and gotten him to a medic who then assured him that Mitchell would be fine as long as Gaia didn't take over the world and he let the children of Apollo do their things, Malcolm realised the absurdity of the situation. The one time he actually asked a guy out, it was by accident. He figured that that was okay. Penicillin was an accident too, and look how well that turned out.

147,3,26,3-HecateA-26.txt,percy-jackson-and-the-olympians,HecateA,"herself in this kind of mess once more. Besides, would Thalia let any mortal doctor touch her? Luke didn't have any money on him anyways- and if you needed that to get treated, he wouldn't be able to get her in anyways. He had to listen to Thalia now, to let her make the hard choices- because she would go ahead and make them anyways. That pigheadedness was something he'd admired about Thalia, but now he was scared of the thought process it inspired. Two prayers in one night, he thought. You guys are lucky up there. But don't get too excited. Just keep Thalia safe, please, please, please, that's all I need. Keep her safe. He took the bottle of ambrosia from the storage bin that had been buried in the sand, and shook it. It looked like apple juice, fizzing up in the bottle. He held the bottle just over Thalia's wound and was about to put it away. This was too dangerous. He'd been so afraid of losing Thalia all night, this was a sign. This was a signal that she meant too much to him, more than a best friend did, for him to play with her life. But then he made himself tip it. The nectar poured over Thalia's leg and she screamed. ""I know, I know, I'm sorry,"" Luke said. Thalia's hands were knotted in the blanket she was laying on and her back arched. But her leg didn't move a hair. Even half-unconscious and rather delusional (she'd started talking to him about bugs crawling on her arms) she knew what was going on. The wound sizzled. Luke wanted to throw up, but it meant that something was happening right? He put more nectar on the wound and Thalia yelled again. She tried putting her wrist in her mouth to stop herself, but Luke knew that the pain didn't get any more tolerable. If anything, it seemed to hurt her more every time and that might have made him stop if he wasn't so scared of losing her. Losing his best friend would be one thing, but losing Thalia was unfathomable and Luke could not let it happen. He tipped the bottle again and Thalia screamed again. Tears prickled Luke's eyes and before he knew it, he was crying too. Nerves, fear, fatigue, compassion- whatever it was, it was rushing back to Luke all too quickly and the tears were coming down quietly. He did this again and again. The wound sizzled again and again. Pus and blood and whatever else came out. Luke whipped it away in between pourings until he had no more nectar left. He threw the bottle away, whipped the gunk away, smeared some Polysporin on and applied a new bandage. He hoped that that was enough. Because if not, nothing would be and he'd lose her. 5:37 AM She was stable. Finally. Luke breathed a sigh of relief. Light was poking in through the holes in their shelter and the sun was rising. So was Thalia's chest. No more fever, no more shivering, no more weird breathing, no more moaning and hallucinating. Thalia was sleeping peacefully. 8:30 AM Thalia came around for the first time and her eyes were clear. That's how Luke knew that she may stick around. He told her briefly what happened. She'd gotten sick, Luke had brought her here and healed her. ""I remember bits and pieces,"" Thalia said. ""My leg hurt like a bitch. You were calming me down all the time. Except you left for a bit, to get supplies. It was hell of a night."" The darkest night of my life, Luke wanted to say. But he didn't. It'd been agonizing, tiring, frustrating, draining and terrifying. Coming so close to losing Thalia had made him realise just how much she mattered to him but… but that much importance was nearly overwhelming for Luke. Thalia wouldn't like it. Besides, she'd just nearly died. She deserved a break. ""Speaking of my leaving,"" Luke said. ""I was technically on a medical supply run…"" ""But you took more things,"" Thalia finished. They knew each other too well. ""Hey, don't say it like that,"" Luke said. ""I even have stuff you may like."" Luke showed her the food first and she smiled and clapped at that. ""Not pizza, but peanut butter's good- no arguing about that,"" Luke said. ""I found these Kool-Aid jammers or something- it's like Kool-Aid in juice box forms. I think it's genius, but here's what you're interested in."" Luke produced a bottle of black nail polish, some cheap drugstore earrings and maltesers. Thalia frowned and sat up, backing herself up to the side of the safe house. ""I figured that I may have to encourage you to get better,"" he said. ""I also figured that you'd probably hate the earrings, but that I should grab them anyways…"" ""You're sweet,"" Thalia smiled. ""And they're not even that bad."" Score. ""Thank you,"" Thalia said. ""For taking care of me. You should get some sleep, you've been up for hours."" ""I'm okay, you rest."" ""Luke Castellan, go to sleep or this is going to be hell of day too,"" Thalia said. ""I'm okay. Promise. I'll just eat some Maltesers and stand guard."" ""And wake me up if you feel sick or tired?"" ""Sure,"" Thalia said. She wouldn't, but Luke couldn't win a fight against her- especially not when she was getting her colors back and looking healthy again. He put his head down on her lap and he was out like a light.

Or when my friends open up a bag of candy to study, I still pick out the blue ones and put them aside for him. And I still try to decide if I need to do laundry by wondering if I have any clean jeans to wear on date night. I keep adding movies and shows to the list of things we need to watch on the back of my chemistry notebook even if we don't check it anymore. I… I can't really believe he's not going to come back, just one day out of the blue and apologize and let me call him Seaweed Brain and smack his arm. I can't make myself operate as if he's not around. It's like Hera took him, but he's still here. I can't... I bought him a birthday present already, and he hasn't even opened his Christmas present yet. It's still under my bunk at camp. That's ridiculous. I can't just be without him, even if he's away, and I don't know what's wrong with me."" ""Sweetheart, that's okay,"" Sally said. She laughed under her breath, but not in a teasing way. It was warm and uplifting and Annabeth sat up and looked at Sally, brow furrowed. Sally pushed a curl back behind Annabeth's right ear. ""Did Percy tell you about Gabe?"" Annabeth was startled at how casually she mentioned it. ""Yes,"" she said mechanically. ""A bit. Not the details, but…"" ""He mentioned how he hit me?"" Sally said. ""Among some other things."" Annabeth nodded. Sally nodded back and pushed some curls back, behind her left ear this time. ""When I met Paul, I was terrified,"" Sally said. ""I had all this hurt that I was still processing, and that maybe I'll work on for the rest of my life. I don't know. And at the same time I had all this excitement and all these questions and all this energy. All I wanted to do was listen to his stories and tell him mine, go out for coffee, hold his hand, exchange novels and read the Post-Its that he always leaves in his books, fall asleep on the phone… I thought I was an idiot. Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me- you know that saying. It was overwhelming, falling in love. I was a bit of a mess. But that's okay. That's what love is, when you've been hurt before. It feels like too much, too big, too soon, too good. But it's not. Love is always like that. It's all-consuming."" Annabeth didn't know what to reply. The word love rung in her ears until it developed its own heartbeat, somewhere in the back of Annabeth's head, and thumped away. ""And Percy is good to you,"" Sally said. ""Do you remember that B- he got on his biology test? Before I could even congratulate him he said 'I have to tell Annabeth'. When he came back from his Father's place with that red coral, he asked me about a dozen times if it was nice enough to give to you, and if I thought you'd like it. He wore proper shoes on your one month anniversary. He goes to museums with you. Do you know his track record with museums? It's not good, but he goes in them willingly, for you and to be with you. He loves you so much, even if he hasn't told you yet -and that's between you two, but… Well, he's not very good at keeping secrets, our Percy."" Annabeth smiled at that. ""We ran into my mother when he came with me to drop off blueprints for Olympus. Maybe a month after we started dating. You should have seen his face. He jumped back at least four feet and stayed there until she was gone."" Sally laughed. ""You know how awful Paul's family is?"" Sally asked. ""I heard,"" Annabeth said. ""Well, last time Paul couldn't get off the hook for a Sunday brunch, he was bragging about you,"" Sally said. ""He really does think you make him better. Paul's mother was still unimpressed, but that's a her problem, not a you problem."" Annabeth laughed. Sally squeezed her hands. ""You don't have to be scared of this,"" Sally said. ""This is normal."" ""It feels so big,"" Annabeth said. ""Maybe it is,"" Sally said. ""Or maybe it's simple. Maybe you're best friends and have been for a while, now."" ""We're supposed to be young,"" Annabeth said. ""It's not about age,"" Sally said. ""You're allowed to be in love, Annabeth. It's okay for it to feel destabilizing and big and difficult."" ""I wish it weren't,"" Annabeth said. ""That's a whole other story,"" Sally said. ""And welcome to the club."" ""Does that club have tea and cookies too?"" Annabeth asked. Sally smiled, and this time the lines around her eyes creased the right way. That made Annabeth smile too. It was a simple thing, really, how beautiful and comforting Sally's smile was. Even in the mess that the gods had made, with Percy missing and another storm brewing on their horizon. And Annabeth reconsidered everything, then. If the smile of a mother seperated from her child could be simple, what was difficult? Maybe it was simple, her and Percy together. Maybe he was her first best friend and always would be, and maybe she loved him because there was no other choice. Maybe it was as simple as her heartbeat. No matter how miraculous and complex the human body was, at the end of the day, it wasn't difficult to close her eyes, put her fingers to her neck, and count her heartbeats. The regular muscular contractions, the steady thumps of blood rushing through her veins and keeping her alive... It was easy. One Mississippi. Two Mississippi. Three Mississippi..."

Love is when the other person's happiness is more important than your own. -H. Jackson Brown, Jr. Will was having a blast and a half. The Argo II had been declared, by the senate, to be property of the Greeks and so the ship was presently in their custody, parked in the lake and doing nothing but looking cool. Which meant that it became an ideal party center. The children of Hephaestus and Apollo would work together and make playlists and plus amps so that music blasted through the entire ship. The place was usually decked out in crazy insane lights. The doors to the cabins had been locked (for obvious reasons) and the engine room was guarded by children of Ares- but that still left plenty of room for dancing and mingling and darts and whatever else happened on any given night. It was awesome. Will loved it, loved the karaoke machine, loved the noise and the jumble of people and the carefree attitude of people sipping soda and ""apple juice"". He was sitting on the edge of the railing and laughing at a joke that Travis told him, feeling really good with the night air against his skin, the stars in the sky, his hand in Jake's and a plastic cup of root beer in his hand. He turned towards Jake, who loved knock-knock jokes, to give him a "" that one's funny"" look, but Jake wasn't even looking at him. Jake looked teeny tiny and overwhelmed by the action and the crowd and the music. ""I doubt we'll hear another knock-knock joke like that,"" Will said. ""Let's call it a night?"" Jake nodded and they left the ship before it was even 9:00. Son why you got to sing that tune Catch a Dylan song or some eclipse of the moon Let an angel swing and make you swoon Then you will see...

He wanted to get a degree in English literature and become a teacher, and he was thankful for all the help that Paul Blofis had given him to do so and the support he'd gotten and the fact that Apollo and Camp were helping him pay off his bills, but he couldn't handle sitting down and listening to people talk about Shakespeare as if they knew decisively what they meant. Will hated his dorm. It was too small and grey and he couldn't put posters or pictures up or else the school would freak. He didn't like how he was paying tons of money to do this. His roommate left Cheetos everywhere, had girls over all the time, he always hid Will's stuff as a joke, and he hated everything- including Will. Will hated the premise that people had to pay for knowledge in order to make money and accomplish their dreams. Will didn't like how he couldn't go jogging all the time and couldn't exercise at all. Will hated how he felt so naked and unarmed all the time because he couldn't bring his bow and arrow around, and had to carry a knife and hope for the best about monsters. He hated it, mostly. And people always asked him why are you doing it then? Nobody's making you become a teacher. Nobody's making you live in a dorm. And Will always answered with, ""Because it's the easiest way to get to my life with Jake as quickly as possible."" A good marriage is a long conversation which always seems too short. -Andre Maurois They were squashed against the couch on their first night in their first apartment in New York City. Yikes. This would have been terrifying, if Will wasn't moving in with the calming kind of handyman that Jake Mason was. They could conquer any rent, any malfunction, any issue. Except for Will's first day as a teacher tomorrow. That was a terrifying perspective, and it was a sad little reminder that Will wasn't actually a kid anymore. Now he was an adult. With things like responsibilities and taxes. He'd have to start wearing suits and non-sandal shoes. It was all scary, and Will couldn't sleep at the thought of it all. So Jake was staying up with him for the night since he wasn't working but going to a 12:30 lecture tomorrow about some form of engineering. The TV got boring, the news was looping, all the soap operas were in Spanish, their conversations were dulling, and Jake was starting to fall asleep. ""Hey,"" Will said shaking him awake. ""Wake up. You said I owed you five bucks if you fell asleep. We need to start another conversation."" That was the thing with them. They didn't have to talk or be doing something all the time, being with each other and chilling on a couch they'd picked up on a curb was enough. It didn't help with the all-nighters, though. Just as Will was about to go make coffee, Jake sat up. ""Alright. How's this."" He pulled something from his pocket- a tiny box that... no... no way he had not he was not... Jake got down to one knee and smiled at Will. ""Will you're not an idiot and you know exactly what's going on and so you must also know how much I love you. In which case, will you marry me?""

150,3,25,3-HecateA-25.txt,percy-jackson-and-the-olympians,HecateA,"Poseidon,"" Hera said. ""It's a pleasure to see that you've been paying attention. No, we gods cannot bring back the dead. But we can grant wishes, and we can create as easily as we can destroy. I'll let you puzzle the pieces out. If I were you, I would call a hospital to have this little one checked up on and registered by the state. I have full confidence that on Christmas night, the childless couple who found a baby in the park may be allowed to sit by her, and that you may even be championed in the event of an adoption case."" Annabeth shook her head, looking at the goddess. There were a thousand questions in her eyes, some of them, Percy guessed, may be- why, what, when did you decide to play nice, who is making you do this, what is the catch. ""Consider this a Christmas gift,"" Hera said. ""Since the season is right. Consider it payment. And my debts to you both wiped."" The goddess disappeared as quickly as she'd appeared and Annabeth choked on a sob. ""Percy,"" she said. ""Percy… It's her. It's her, we've been following her all night, like a star."" ""I can't believe this,"" Percy said. But he looked down at the baby and her amber eyes, and he also saw a little button nose that he'd seen in Annabeth's baby pictures and a splash of freckles he knew he'd born as a kid. ""I'll call an ambulance,"" Annabeth said. ""Like Hera said."" ""I think this is the first time we're listening to Hera word by word,"" Percy said. ""Hush, Seaweed Brain,"" Annabeth said. She took off her scarf, holding the phone between her ear and her shoulder as she pushed it into Percy's coat, to keep the baby warm. ""Hello? I need an ambulance in Central Park… My husband and I found a baby in the snow…"" ""Our baby,"" Percy said quietly. His watch beeped, it was 12:00 AM on Christmas day. ""We found our baby in the snow."" There were few things that Percy and Annabeth had wanted to do less than host a New Years' Eve party, but Piper had made it pretty clear that even if she weren't invited, she would be showing up at their house to see the baby- so they may as well feed her and let her watch the ball drop on their television. The baby was currently in Hazel's arms, however. She was wearing a dress with a white skirt and a black top and a silly paper crown from a Christmas cracker on top of her curls. She and Frank were cooing and making faces and trying to elicit a laugh from the baby, giving each other high-fives every time they got her to giggle. Leo and Jason were helping Percy with the dishes. Grover was eating tin cans and healing all the plants in the apartment that Percy and Annabeth had nearly killed since the last time he'd come by and saved their greenery. Magnus, Piper and Reyna were sitting on a couch and exchanging phrases in Norse, French and Spanish- which Percy knew wasn't going to go well because they were also finishing a bottle of wine. Harper Jane was telling Nico and Will all about how when she'd gone to the doctor a mean doctor had given her a shot, so it was good that they were going to school to become good doctors. Mom and Paul were looking on amused, and also catching up with Frederic Chase who had flown across the country as soon as Annabeth had called. Malcolm was inspecting the structural integrity of the baby's crib, which Percy thought was frankly unnecessary since the baby had been safe and sound for the last three days- since her discharge from hospital. He didn't complain. He just pulled dessert out of the fridge and brought his double chocolate cheesecake out with a pile of forks and knives and paper plates. ""Hazel, you're going to have to give up the baby,"" Annabeth said. ""Her bottle's ready."" ""I can feed her,"" Hazel said. ""Let me? Please. Please, please, please!"" ""She's a fussy eater,"" Annabeth said. ""But later you can change her if you want."" ""Oh no,"" Hazel said. ""Oh no, she is too cute like this, she has to stay in her little ladybug pajamas forever."" Frank kissed the baby goodbye on the forehead, and then she was passed to Annabeth who got settled on the couch with the bottle. The doorbell rang while everyone was digging into their cake. It was Chiron in his wheelchair, snowflakes dusting his hat and scarf and shoulders. ""Chiron!"" Percy said. ""Happy New Year's, Perseus,"" Chiron said. Percy stepped aside to let him in. ""My dear boy,"" he said. ""News takes a little bit of time to reach us at Camp, but not too long. Mr D will never forgive you for not having told us yourself, or so he says. I believe he's forgotten the entire issue by now, but I, for one, was very excited to hear about your…"" Surprise adoption? Mystery baby? ""Christmas present,"" Percy supplied, while taking Chiron's coat. Chiron laughed. ""Annabeth, Chiron's here,"" Percy said. He showed Chiron the way in, and Annabeth smiled from the couch where she and the baby sat. Chiron's eyes softened when he saw her. ""She's precious,"" Chiron said. Annabeth got up and brought the baby over, and slipped her into Chiron's arms. She squirmed for a minute, but settled down rather quickly in the centaur's arms. ""She looks like you, Annabeth,"" Chiron said. ""The nurses at the hospital honestly could not believe it,"" Annabeth said. ""It's just been coincidence after coincidence after coincidence for the three of us..."" ""I assume she has a name?"" Chiron asked. ""Well, yes, the nurses at the hospital named her, and we like it,"" Percy said. ""It's Evie- well, Eve. Eve Mariana Olivia Jackson. Although that last part's not official yet. But we're planning on it."""

Hazel dug deep to remember the Spanish that she'd heard flying around the Valdez house so long ago, and found the word to thank him. ""I was always going to die,"" Hazel said. ""I was never going to get out of the war with Gaia alive, one way or another. Either I died on the battlefield like a hero, or Pluto sent me back when all was said and done- don't fight me on this, you know it too."" Frank bit his lip to keep his mouth shut. ""You, on the other hand…"" Hazel said. She closed her eyes and sighed. ""You were going to be praetor. You were talking to me about learning mandarin, becoming a doctor. You had plans and you might have actually gotten to them Frank, you weren't supposed to die."" ""Ideally nobody was going to die,"" Frank said. ""There's a different between ideas and reality,"" Hazel said dunking the bread in her coffee repeatedly. ""And that's the problem. It's all so sweet to give your life for something and die for someone, but gods, Frank, nobody's actually supposed to do that."" Frank frowned and Hazel grabbed handfuls of her hair. ""You had such an awesome life to live and so much to give the world,"" Hazel said. ""I can't believe you're here and it makes me so, so sad and so guilty and…"" She couldn't even finish what she was saying, she could only burry her face in her hands. She remembered when they'd read battered up copies of Romeo and Juliet at school. She remembered how Sister Agnes had blotted out some of the racier parts and dirty jokes, but the ending had stayed. Romeo killing herself on what he thought was Juliet's corpse. Juliet kissing the poison off of her lover's lips and finding her death… she remembered how all the girls had awed and teared up and called it romantic and sweet and how they'd all dreamed of boys who would follow them through death- they'd all gossiped about it in the bathrooms. Back then, Hazel had seemed least likely to ever have a sweetheart, much less one like that. Now that she did, it felt so unfair. She felt so guilty and sad and terrified and so, so guilty . None of those emotions were romantic. ""Wait, wait, wait,"" Frank said. ""Hazel? Do you..? Do you know how I died?"" ""I died first,"" Hazel said. ""But… how do you think I died?"" Frank asked. Hazel swallowed. ""You think I did it on purpose, don't you?"" Frank said, his eyes widening. ""You think I willingly took a knife or something to follow you to the Underworld…"" Hazel didn't meet his eyes. Her coffee was a way more comfortable alternative. ""My gods, Hazel,"" Frank said. ""My gods, no. I was thrown into the Mediterranean by a giant. My arm was broken I was too hurt on impact to transform. I drowned. That's it. That's what happened to me, just another casualty, an accident. Gods, Hazel, I would never have willingly died…"" ""That's not what it sounded like on the boat, okay?"" Hazel said, bunching the overlong sleeves of her sweater in her hands. ""The morning before we all suited up and left to fight, you told me that no matter what happened on the battlefield, you'd always love me and you'd do anything to stay with me. When I saw you after that, I thought… I… can you blame me?"" ""No,"" Frank said. ""No, but Hazel, that's… that's so not what happened."" He reached across the table and took her hands impulsively. ""Hazel, if it weren't for that giant, I would have lived for you,"" Frank said. ""I would have taken all the life and love and happiness and curiosity that you had or wanted or needed or never got to have and poured it into every single thing I did until the day that I died if I'd gotten the chance. Every single bit of courage you had to show, and I'd have doubled it to do all the things right. I'd have done everything you dreamed to do and gone to all the places in the world that you never got to see and holy crap, Hazel, I'd have had the life. I would have had it, I would have lived, in your honour because you've shown me, if nothing else, that life is more important than death time and time again."" Hazel's heart froze in her chest. That was even more important. Hazel's free hand curled around her cup of coffee. ""You're serious?"" ""I am,"" Frank said. ""If I died it's not… it's not my choice. It's just the way that fate works. It's just another way that we end up at the same place at the same time. If I weren't meant to die, there's no way I could have done it. Nothing can change destiny, right?"" Hazel nodded softly. Her curls bounced. ""I shouldn't have shut you out so quickly,"" Hazel said. ""It's not your fault,"" Frank said. ""See, it's easier being alone in Elysium than being with someone that you wanted to see live for years and years and years,"" Hazel said. ""I wouldn't know,"" Frank said. ""I haven't, you know, actually done enough to compare it."" Hazel was quiet for a few seconds. ""It's not too late,"" Hazel said. Frank smiled, but that wasn't enough for Hazel. She leaned across the table and kissed him, right on the lips. It tasted like coffee but that only made it better for Hazel. Nothing could have stopped her from melting at Frank's touch and nothing could have made her want to stay solid now that she had him back. ""I feel so stupid,"" Hazel said when she pulled back. ""I'm sorry."" ""I'm sure you can make it up to me,"" Frank smiled shyly. Hazel kissed him again. Upcoming ship weeks September 21 - 27 - Calypso and Leo 28 - October 7 - Percy and Annabeth"
152,1,2,1-HecateA-2.txt,hunger-games,HecateA,"future drawn in Cinna's sketchbooks -of wedding gowns and bridesmaids dresses- told the tale. While he touched up the curls of her hair, he let Katniss flip through the pages of her sketchbook. Every now and then she recognised a sketch that they'd posed as one of the dresses that her ""talent"" had brought her to design on that phony Capitol report, and she smiled but didn't say anything in case the room was bugged. ""This isn't one of mine. Who's getting married?"" Katniss asked when she looked at one of the white gowns. To be honest, it was a ball gown that Cinna had drawn with Portia's image glowing in his mind. The bodice was snug and striped with diagonal lines of silver beads imprinted into the corset and then down the skirt, as if the bride was the center of a spiral. The train was generous and imposing, the beadwork was simple but fascinating. Katniss flipped to the next one; a gown with intricate folds in the taffeta bodice, and touches of lace on the mermaid skirt. This one showed off the figure that Portia was so proud of, and a meticulously haphazard shawl would hide the scar on her shoulder that she was always did her best to hide. After that came a dress with long white sleeves and a tight fit like a sheath to a sword. Peepholes and slits were strategically placed over the shoulders and ribs and around the wrists to give the gown a quaint, unique look. Romantic chiffon, bold ribbons racing all over the dress, lace skirts, sheer sleeves, intricate backs… try as he might, Cinna hadn't been able to design a dress for Portia that he liked. Actually no- it was the other way around. He'd drawn and drawn and drawn and there wasn't a single dress that he didn't like. Mostly because he visualised Portia in all of them. ""Nobody,"" Cinna said. ""Portia and I were wondering if we should add a bridal shop section to our store. Traditional marriages are coming back into fashion since yours was announced, you know."" Katniss nodded and looked at the ground. The truth was that the dress was for a happier bride. Portia had been told to disappear. She had. Not only had Haymitch taken the courtesy of running down to tell her even though he should be monitoring the bloodbath at the Cornucopia, but Cinna himself had been acting awfully cryptic since the incident with the Mockingjay wedding dress. He'd kissed her and held her face between his hands, lightly as if she was a glass object and tight as he could without hurting her. ""I didn't want to modify the dress without you,"" Cinna said. ""I know we have an agreement. Still, some things aren't worth hurting you for. And I don't want you to get hurt. I want you to run away from anything that could ever hurt you if you get a sign."" She'd associated this intense worry with overflowing concern for Katniss and Peeta, but now she had a daunting suspicion that there was more. Anyways, she'd rung up a few friends whose ill-timed laser eye colouring surgery left them unable to look at screens, ergo unable to watch the Quarter Quell. They were going to rend a villa on the outskirts of the Capitol for the time being. Since they were bitter about their inability to watch such important Games (""what will we tell our grandchildren for them to forgive us!"") and excited since Portia hadn't selected any brides maids yet (""it's a very important decision dear and a very big honour""), they'd accepted this spontaneous vacation. Portia had laughed and said that after all the time and energy they'd put into the flaming costumes and morphing dresses, she needed a break from the games. The plan was for her to pack a bag, empty her bank account and run. Haymitch had promised to find her and pick her up when and where he could if she stayed put at the villa he'd picked out for her, which belonged to Plutarch Heavensbee for whatever godforsaken reason. But on her way out of their flat, it dawned on Portia that this was the last time she'd be seeing this flat one way or another- and certainly everything in it. Of course, there were some knickknacks too big and too unworthy to bring, but there were pieces of Cinna… well, Portia had been told that she'd never have him back but pieces of him… She cursed herself and grabbed another bag and crammed in portfolios, sketchbooks, notebooks, computer chips on which his digital designs would be saved. She had to bring these since the fact that she couldn't bring him… well, it was dawning on her. In her haste she dropped one. Swearing and puffing and slowly stifling a cry (she must've been in the room right next to him with Peeta, right next to him) she picked it up until she noticed what it was filled with. Wedding dresses. One after the other. There were fun and flowy dresses, traditional gowns, ball gowns that must weigh a ton and flirty shorter dresses. Every manner of beading and embroidery and decoration had been exploited and Portia had never, ever seen Cinna on such a good run of designs. The last one in the book had been scratched out in thick black ink- scratched out! Cinna had penned a little note: I don't care what she wears. She'll be beautiful and we'll be each other's. I may as well let Haymitch pick. Portia's resistance and all the composure she'd mustered to walk herself from the arena to their flat –Cinna having the keys on him- melted like snow in the rain and she didn't get back up with the book, but she too melted onto the floor in a puddle of embarrassing but deeply necessary sobs. It was because of that last note that she ended up being too late."
153,1,1,1-HecateA-1.txt,hunger-games,HecateA,"and I have to say so instead of awkwardly bouncing from our coffee dates to my real ugly life. And you like me, so you have to do something other than call me beautiful."" ""Okay,"" Cinna said- and this completely for lack of a better word. What did one reply to that? Maybe Portia didn't know what else to do from that point on, or maybe she was just less clueless than Cinna was. At any rate, she wrapped her arms around Cinna's neck and pulled him into a kiss. Shock kept him from responding at first, but once he started kissing her back it was hard to stop. It was impossible, actually. There was something incredibly entrancing about picking every single palette and fabric and cream and colour that went on someone and still being surprised by how sweet their lips tasted. Entrancing and… addictive. There was something about him that Portia liked too, apparently. Because they didn't stop until daybreak. He may not be proud of it, but Portia had spent more than enough nights at his house by this point. It had become easy to wake up next to her and wiggle his way out of bed for a drink of water and then slide back in without disturbing her rest. Easy but… disappointing. He wished that the sun knew what the moon did. He wished that Portia could love him when it wasn't dark. He wished that Portia could love herself in the light- though he wasn't sure that she did much of that in the dark either… It's because she never sees herself sleep, Cinna thought one night when he got out of bed to shut a window and spared a moment to watch her sleep. She was curled on her side, with her hair fanned on the pillow. She doesn't see herself in all the little ways I do. She doesn't see the flick of her fingertips when she brushes her hair back, because she's doing it. She doesn't see how beautiful her smile is because in every mirror she's ever looked, the image has been flipped and distorted. She doesn't see herself be so peaceful when she sleeps, so she never can be. It frustrated him, and when he slipped back between the sheets and wrapped his arms around her, she actually pushed him back in her sleep because of how tightly he clung to her. Cinna was half-dressed by the time he found Portia in the kitchen brewing coffee. She'd apparently pulled on a button-up shirt of his from the day before and had already poured him a cup. Her bangs were flipped back into the rest of her hair which gave the slowly-but-surely returning curls even more volume. She looked at her reflection in the fridge. ""I am not a morning person,"" she said, smiling at him. ""Good thing I'm with the right man to fix me up."" Considering how patient he was, Cinna didn't know why exactly this was what really got him going. What really made him angry… But it did. ""You know Portia, you don't have to repeat every single awful thing that's ever been said to you in a half-assed funny way,"" Cinna said. ""I don't want to hear Boris and your agent and the tabloids every time you open your mouth, and I don't want to feel all their misery and longing every night when you show up at my door and come to me, and I don't want to see your dreams and ideas and questions from afar because you don't want to be more than a pretty face."" Portia looked at him with wide eyes. "" Excuse me?"" ""You're not an idiot. You know exactly what I mean."" Portia put her coffee down. ""Well good morning to you too."" ""Good morning,"" Cinna said. ""That doesn't mean that I'm not right."" Portia just watched him as he opened the refrigerator and started making breakfast. ""Cinna,"" Portia said. ""Even to you, if I'm not a model, what am I?"" ""I don't know,"" Cinna said. ""I've only met you as a model so far. I don't know if you could be a designer or a singer or an engineer or a diplomat. You've never let yourself be more than that."" Portia smiled. ""My life is much more complicated than it looks, baby. Social constructs, however? That's been decided for you. It's so much easier to let others make you into something than to contort yourself into a thousand shapes."" ""But that's eating you alive and breaking you to pieces too,"" Cinna said. ""It's not keeping you safe, and it's caging you."" She didn't fight him on the subject, and Cinna sighed. ""Don't you get it, Portia? I don't make you beautiful. You always just were,"" Cinna said. She was quiet until she said. ""I brought the sketching pad you gave me. I'm actually using it."" ""That's great,"" Cinna said. ""I drew things in it,"" Portia said nervously. ""I'd like you to look."" ""I'd love to,"" Cinna said. Portia nodded and went to go find her purse from where she'd tossed it last night, when she'd first fallen into his arms. The sketches were beautiful, and Cinna said so about each and every one. Even the trickier ones, the sketchier ones, the ones where the textures and colours and patterns didn't quite add up… there was always something beautiful. Just like every single moment with Portia, period. ""Do you think that these are good enough to… to sell? To make?"" Portia asked. ""I don't know,"" Cinna said. ""We'll have to start by ditching Boris and all his things, and putting a sewing machine where he kept his socks."" ""Actually, I was thinking that putting one by that window would be a nice working space,"" Portia said pointing to the one in Cinna's living room. ""And if we put a fabric shelving system over there…"" ""Brilliant,"" Cinna smiled. ""Absolutely brilliant."" He kissed her hair. ""Beautiful,"" he corrected. ""Absolutely beautiful."""

If he didn't acknowledge the sweater, he'd look like a jerk. ""Actually, it's an ugly Christmas sweater,"" Leo said. ""Regardless, we need you to put it on your body right now."" ""Why do people purposefully wear sweaters that are ugly?"" Jason said. Piper shrugged. ""I've never understood it, but I'm all onboard for a day of unprejudiced warmth and cosiness."" Jason examined his particular sweater more closely. It was an awful apple green with red reindeers knitted into it. Snowflakes were a trim at the collar, neck and sleeves. ""We decided to get a mildly ugly one,"" Piper said. ""Just because you're a beginner."" ""Christmas Virgin!"" Leo shouted. ""This is mild?"" Jason said examining the sweater. It got worst once Jason realised that there were jingle bells knitted into the sweater. Leo's sweater just about blinded Jason. ""I'm dreaming of a white Christmas Just like the ones I used to know Where the tree-tops glisten and children listen To hear sleigh bells in the snooooooooooooooooooooooooooow…."" ""Leo stop you're from Texas."" When Jason answered his door groggily, it was because Piper and Leo had knocked. Both of them were beaming and giddy like little kids, and wearing red Santa Claus hats. ""Well there's Piper's Christmas present,"" Leo said nudging his head towards Jason's bare chest. ""Get some clothes on, Grace. We've got things to do and places to go."" ""What time is it?"" Jason asked, worried by the lack of light. ""6:00 AM,"" Piper said. ""We have to go check the Christmas tree."" ""The Christmas tree?"" Jason asked. ""Thalia's tree, if you insist,"" Piper said. She looked adorable today. She was wearing jeans and a red shirt with holes in her shoulders. From her Santa hat, two braids poked out. The excitement on her face really stole the cake, though. ""Sheesh. Told you he was a virgin."" Jason got dressed and was sent back to go find a red or green shirt. Piper nodded proudly when he came out wearing an army green thermal shirt. Leo ran out ahead of them, but Piper dangled at Jason's arm and put her head on his shoulder. ""Merry Christmas, by the way."" ""Merry Christmas,"" Jason repeated. The greeting sounded weird in his mouth. ""Did Valdez wake you up too?"" Piper arched an eyebrow. ""I had an alarm set."" Under Thalia's tree, presents were gathered. And from the lowest branch, three red socks (that looked hand-sewn) filled with whatever were dangling. ""What's this?"" Jason asked. ""Didn't you figure it out as we went along?"" Leo asked. ""The presents go under the tree?"" ""What?"" Jason asked. ""I thought the trees were the present?"" ""No, no, no,"" Leo said. ""You got it all wrong. Trees under the present, and stockings –that's the sock things- on the mantel piece. We don't have one of those though, so we made-do. Piper made the set-up cute."" ""I…"" Jason felt infinitely guilty. ""I didn't get you guys anything. I didn't… I hadn't caught on that you were supposed to… get people presents at Christmas…"" ""It's okay,"" Piper said. ""We knew that you didn't know, but we wanted you to have a first Christmas in which you didn't freak out about gifts."" ""And we also knew that you would feel bad, so Piper and I bought each other gifts with your name on the tag. You can pay us back later,"" Leo said. Jason grinned, somewhat relieved. ""I'll make it up to you guys next year,"" he promised. ""Does that mean that you like Christmas enough to do it again?"" Piper asked, smiling. ""Only with you guys,"" he said pulling her towards him and smiling at Valdez. ""Wow,"" Leo said. ""He says this and we haven't even opened presents yet."" ""The first Noel the angel did say Was to certain poor shepards in fields as they lay: In fields where they lay a keeping their sheep On a cold winter's night that was so deep.

""That's because Piper can sing,"" Jason said. ""Like really well."" Leo crossed his arms. Piper stuck her tongue out. ""See why I told you to go easy at lunch?"" Leo laughed. ""Turkey is my favourite food ever. This is what my ambrosia will taste like now."" ""With or without cranberry sauce?"" Leo asked. ""Covered in it."" Jason said. ""I'm so full, but I want to keep eating…"" ""Sorry man. No vomitoriums here."" Leo said. ""Just turkey hangovers and pain."" ""That's not something the Romans actually did,"" Jason said. ""Oh. Whatever. Wash it down with some more eggnog,"" Leo said. ""Does the eggnog help with anything?"" ""No, but at this point it's go big or go home,"" Leo said. Jason laughed. ""Jingle bells, Chiron smells, Peleus laid an egg! Argo II has lost a sail and Gaia burned the earth- HEY!"" ""Leo what the fuck?"" Piper said. ""I liked the one about Noel,"" Jason said, running his hand up and down her back. ""Did you have a good Christmas?"" Piper said as they walked around Camp after the Apollo Cabin's (supposedly) Annual Christmas Carol Camp Fire. ""I did,""Jason said. ""Or at least I think I did. I had a blast, anyways."" ""Good,"" Piper smiled. ""But there's still one Christmas tradition that we haven't covered…"" ""Which one?"" Jason asked. ""Look up,"" Piper said. That's when he realised that she'd been steering him towards the Big House's front door. He did. A kind of plant with white berries was hanging over the doorframe. ""That,"" Piper said. ""Is mistletoe."" ""Oh,""Jason said. "" That I know about."" He wrapped his arms around her and kissed her. ""FA LA LA LA LAAAAAAAAAAAA..."" ""Are you going to say anything?"" Jason asked. ""Nah,"" Piper shrugged. ""Let it go. It's Christmas."" ""-LA LA LA LAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!"""

""I can't believe that a guy like me ended up with a girl like you…"" This time Silena pulled away. ""What do you mean 'a guy like you' and why do you say it like that? Someone kind? Someone strong? Someone soft? Someone skilled and talented? Someone ingenious? Someone intelligent? Someone loving and loveable? Someone calming? Someone with leadership? Someone honest? Huh?"" Silena said with strict eyes. ""None of those things deserve anything less than the best because those are all extraordinary qualities, you know . Jesus, Charlie. I'm going to have to unteach you some humility and show you how to boast a bit."" ""Yes ma'am,"" Beckendorf said. ""Can we wrap it up here though?"" Patience ""So you take the screwdriver –no don't hold it like that, like that. Move your fingers a bit to the- there you go. Okay. So hold your screwdriver like that and just notch it on the drill piece and… there you go… Other way baby, other way."" ""How can you tell which one?"" Silena asked. Her hair was put up in a hasty bun and she wore a pair of old, slightly scratched, protective goggles. The plan of the day hadn't been for Silena to learn how to use tools, but she'd been sitting with Beckendorf for hours and he figured that she'd started to get bored so… ""Righty tighty, leftie loosie."" "" What?"" ""It's the saying,"" Beckendorf said. ""To remember that to unscrew something you... never mind. Just turn towards the right."" ""Okay,"" Silena said. She was an enthusiastic learner, if not a noobie, overwhelmed and sort-of helpless one. Silena was pretty good at a lot of things. Dealing with difficult people, for example. Taming the horses at camp. Explaining the idea of demigods to new arrivals. Chatting with nymphs when they took loitering campers hostage. Untying knots in girls' hair and braiding even the most unruly hair into beautiful braids. But using tools was not one of them. So Beckendorf was armed with Silena's weapon in most of those aforementioned activities. Patience. ""Okay, stop. You don't want it to go completely in if we're going to tie a rope around it, right?"" Beckendorf said. ""Oh. Right, duh… sorry…"" Lots of it. ""It's okay, babe. We just won't do power tools today."" Kindness At the end of the day, this is what they rested on. Beckendorf being nice enough to give the new daughter of Aphrodite a tour when she was scared of facing her sisters. Silena being kindhearted enough to think of Beckendorf during camp events and pull him into the light and action. Beckendorf bringing her flowers at random times and Silena weaving them into a crown. Silena making Beckendorf's brothers and Nyssa fall in love with her. Beckendorf holding doors for her. Silena saving Beckendorf some of the good snacks when he was late for counsellor meetings. Beckendorf listening through long intense and sometimes hysterical raves and then telling Silena that everything would be okay while rubbing her back and playing with her hair. Silena putting on that popping red lipstick that he liked, kissing a piece of paper and tucking it in his bag when he went to the city or on missions for a few days. Beckendorf forgetting an anniversary and Silena forgiving him. Silena being patient and supportive with her antisocial boyfriend as he stumbled his way through conversations with her family, her friends and sometimes even the ones between the two of them. In the end if something atoned for the sins; it was kindness. And wasn't kindness a kind of basic love? The kind of basic love that you could use as a building block to build anything from a friendship to a long relationships that involved adults falling in love while listening to music a bit more with each passing day and each sip of wine, from dramatic summer flings that burned brightly enough to compensate their short duration and match the sun overlooking it all, to high school sweethearts reuniting. So at the end of the day, it was love that got Silena accepted into Elysium and back to Beckendorf. Even though the judges hadn't paid much attention to that particular factor.. Silena and Beckendorf just seemed to ooze it. They seemed to breathe it and want it and crave it and live in it. Yeah, that was what they did. Living in love.

It was their place. They never went without each other. ""Yes. Forgive my uncleanliness, Milady,"" Kinzie said. ""I'll wash it off as soon as possible."" Hylla, she thought. Not Milady. Hylla. It was nearly crushing how Kinzie had gone without her. What did it mean? And now that she paid attention, she saw that Kinzie's nymph eyes were shot with chlorophyll. Kinzie wasn't that bad of a light weight, and she held her liquor rather well- but it was hard for nymphs to process alcohol (which was the bane of Kinzie's life). Kinzie had drank last night, which probably meant that she'd been on the dance floor, dancing with other people. Hylla tried not to let that make her jealous, but she couldn't. And she couldn't help but be hurt even more. Her advisors –a small, specially selected portion of the court- were gathered around her. They were bouncing the political implications of kicking off this one member of the Queen's old court who was making the new bill on Male worker benefits impossible to pass. Earlier in the day a male worker had jumped an Amazon, smashed her head against the concrete floor and stolen her keys to start a forklift and had caused massive destruction in a warehouse, as well as running over another Amazon. Fifteenof Hylla's subjects had been hurt by the initial event and the following little riot, and that was fifteen too many. She was furious. To top it off, all of this was causing extremely high breakup rates in the kingdom between Amazons and their working boyfriends, which had about half of the staff completely bummed out or meaner than usual and just plunged the entire place into a bad atmosphere. Things were getting bad. And to piss Hylla off personally even more, everybody present was deeply involved in the negotiations and debates except for the one person whose advice she wanted; Kinzie. Kinzie was being quiet and not even meeting Hylla's eyes or doing anything more than picking at her jacket. She wasn't even taking notes or putting up some kind of pretense. That pissed Hylla off. ""Look, I need this bill passed in the next 48 hours,"" Hylla said. She knew slavery. She knew rebellion. This wasn't going to stay contained long. ""So thank you for your counsel, but I'm going to have to do it. Shanyka, go find me Vincent McLeod and bring him here in about fifteen minutes. He acts as spokesperson of the male workers. The rest of you may be dismissed. Except you Kinzie, would you mind staying a few minutes?"" Kinzie shook her head with a ""No ma'am"" that put Hylla's teeth on edge. Everyone left the throne room and Hylla crossed her arms. Kinzie didn't move. ""What are you doing?"" Hylla asked. ""Pardon me?"" Kinzie asked. ""You're ignoring me, you're being so distant, you won't look me in the eye, won't use my name… that's not like you. Even when you're sad or upset that's not like you. Why are you doing that?"" Hylla asked. Kinzie didn't reply for a while. Hell, she didn't even stir. ""Look Kinzie,"" Hylla said. ""I'm already struggling with the paperwork and my limited language skills and the ethics involved with making out on the throne. Don't make me wonder how you feel too."" ""I love you, of course!"" Kinzie said. ""I love you to the moon and back. You should know that!"" ""Then what's going on?"" Hylla asked. ""Because something sure as hell is and sometimes I get this horrifying feeling that after three years of smooth sailing of clicking like each other like puzzle pieces and understanding each other and not pulling crap on one another, something went wrong with us. Talk to me."" Kinzie's eyes were fixed on Hylla with the most profound and deep sadness in them. Then Hylla realised that Kinzie wasn't looking at Hylla, but at the throne. ""I've served three different queens in the same position,"" Kinzie said. ""The first one died of an injury a month after her duel. The second hit me when I didn't bring her lattes fast enough. And the third is you, my girlfriend of three years. What do you think that that pattern looks like to me?"" Hylla frowned and then she processed it. ""You're scared that I'll either die painfully in a duel or a coup or an attack,"" Hylla said. ""Or you're worried that I may become bitter and power hungry and ruthless and heartless. Or maybe both."" Kinzie didn't say a word, but Hylla knew she was right. She walked towards Kinzie and took her hands. ""You became queen by protecting me,"" Kinzie said quietly. ""I didn't want anything to change because of that. I didn't want... I didn't want us to change."" ""Hey,"" Hylla said. ""It's not complicated. You and I are no-bullshit kinds of people. I love you. Do you love me?"" ""Yes,"" Kinzie said. ""Perfect. Then let's not complicate it. We're okay, and we're going to stay okay. Got it?"" ""Yes ma'am,"" Kinzie smiled. ""I mean, yes Hylla."" Hylla's laughter was interrupted by a kiss that tasted like strawberry lipstick, and like every other single kiss that she and Kinzie had ever shared. Kinzie didn't even back away from it fully. She rested her freshly shampooed head against Hylla's chest.

Nobody was much energised by the little old woman who had –purposely, Finnick could tell- only replied "" What? Talk louder sonny!"" to any of Caesar's questions (God bless Mag). Finnick felt defensive and clapped from backstage. His mentor turned towards him and fixed up his collar at the last second. He was wearing a suit, his designer said that he may as well look crisp and classic. However his District was very present. The cuffs and buttons were shaped like sand dollars. The back of his jacket was made entirely of the same netting he'd worn at the parade, showing off the muscles on his back. His ankles were showing, designed like most pants in District Four, and a cut he'd gotten from a hook as a toddler stuck out. The applause spiked, the screaming started and Finnick realised that they must have announced his name. His mentor shoved him, and he jogged onstage smiling and raising a hand. He could nearly hear her: If you're going to smile like that, all fake-like and such, you may as well not smile at all, Finn. He hoped that she'd forgive him. He'd make sure to smile like she liked (like the cameras hated) once before leaving the arena at least. Maybe even raise his pinkie- the sign they'd developed for her to tell him that she was breaking down and needed an out before she collapsed after her games, during social events and such. Whatever, he shook Caesar's hand before ripping his away and opening his arms for a hug. Caesar shrugged, made a face to the scandalised and thrilled audience, and then hugged him. Caesar calmed the audience down seconds after they'd sat down. ""Finnick,"" he said. ""Long time no see."" ""Yeah, eh?"" Finnick said. ""I was strangely okay with it. No offence."" The host laughed and the audience did too. ""None taken, none taken,"" Caesar said waving his hand. ""But you can't be feeling that bad about your chances, can you? I mean, what were your training scores? Eleven? Again?"" The audience cheered and Finnick raised a hand before leaning back in his seat. ""Yeah, well, apparently. Still, I wouldn't count any of these tributes out. They were all victors, right? Besides, some of these people are brilliant dinner conservationists."" More laughed. Caesar said. ""You've been a mentor for so long now, standing behind the kids going into the arena nowadays... How strange is it going to be to get back into an arena?"" ""Very,"" Finnick said. ""Completely bizarre. I mean, my life's been so great… I've been so fortunate to spend time out here and back home... I'll just be dazed and missing everything for as long as I'm in there. Maybe longer."" Anxious whispering shot through the audience. Clearly he was one of the china doll that the Capitol citizens didn't want getting scratched. He wondered if he should have Katniss shoot him to piss off the masses. Nothing big, just an arrow in the hand. He was pretty sure that the girl could be convinced to do it. ""What's the one thing that you'll be missing the most?"" Caesar said. Finnick saw the opening. His stomach folded itself into a painful knot. His throat clogged. ""Actually Caesar, it'll be a some one . Not a some thing."" Excited whispering tore the audience apart. ""A someone,"" Caesar said suggestively. ""A lady perhaps?"" ""Yeah,"" Finnick said without hesitating. ""My one true love."" There were a few gasps. ""Can we get a name?"" Caesar said, jumping at the gossip like a frog. ""No, but you can get a clue,"" Finnick said. ""See, when you get reaped, you don't have the time to say goodbye to all the people you want to and this year… well, I didn't get to anyone."" ""What's our clue?"" Caesar said leaning towards Finnick. Finnick chewed on his lip and got up, brushing off his shirt. He walked to the front of the stage, so that the camera could really see him. See his face. He smiled the clumsy, camera-awkward smile that Annie loved and that his publicity folks didn't. He took a deep breath. ""Anytime Finnick,"" Caesar said. He probably should have said something witty like 'don't rush me Caesar, this is art'. But he really was nervous. Brutal death was on the agenda yet he was still concerned about proclamations. No, actually. He was concerned with goodbyes. He started before his brain could tell his mouth to stop. ""I've spent so much time with my eyes on the sea So many hours given to the waves and their rolling Expectantly I'd be used to things creeping on me But darling, thanks to you my heart is always surprising If the world's your oyster I'm sorry that you couldn't have one better. But darling, if you need to find comfort whatsoever, Please remember that you glimmer. You glimmer like hope, like a sinner's last chance, Like a jewel laying where the sun cares to dance, You glimmer when you smile, or at least when you try Darling you don't even have to do a thing, it's in your eye. As a string of pearls rests around your throat A noose starts surrounding mine The miles between us like a moat But darling, even across time I'd see you shine Now that I've seen firelight jump to your face, Crawl up your chin and cheeks where there's already such grace Now that I've seen the purest stars reflected in your sight It's alright if the world takes me, I've gotten all my light."" He heard the audience going wacko. Women flipping out, convinced that the poem was specifically written for them even though he'd never spoken to them. But just to make sure that the one true love knew who he was talking to… He scratched his nose with his uplifted pinkie."
158,3,1,3-HecateA-1.txt,percy-jackson-and-the-olympians,HecateA,"diplomat who had been brought back from the United States and removed from office after speaking out against Il Duce- Benito Mussolini... There was also Clara, his charming wife, who sang in the church choir and knitted for the soldiers and did a thousand other charitable and kind things. Their first daughter had been Maria di Angelo, definitely a wise-ass and a firecracker in temperment and a bit of a heretic as far as Italian catholics from 1930 were concerned. They had lost three children; their firstborn Anteo in Mussolini's African campaign, their youngest daughter Pamina in childbirth, and their son Adriano during the second world war. But there was another daughter; Sofia. Sofia di Angelo was, in short, a badass. She was an anarchist even during Mussolini's reign, and had been a huge pioneer for women's rights in Italy -so Nico was told. She'd worked in an orphanage for Jewish children for ten years after the war before coming to America with a lesbian lover named Carmela who had left her three weeks later for a veteran who had gotten rich after losing a leg. To this day she said, 'I don't even think I was really lesbian'. Anyways, in New York Sofia had opened a dress shop and when the store became too big for her to handle she hired marginalised women to assist her. Ot all became so wildly popular so fast that she opened three locations before selling the chain to one of her oldest employees and moving on to writing detective novels in German and getting rich off the stock market. In there, she had also studied art history for a year at NYU, taken part in the civil rights protests, disappeared for three months in Tanzania only to later declare that she really loved safaris, purchased multiple motorcycles, and appeared in a viral YouTube video as a 91-year-old lady declaring that her wish had been for 'George Bush or anyone else equally stupid' to never become president while eating red velvet birthday cake. When Nico had met her, she was comfortably wasting away in one of New York's City's best retirement homes where she enjoyed Sudokus, making dresses (she sent them all to Haiti and Syria and wherever tragedies would hit) and blasting bad soap operas to annoy the lady in the room next to hers. You couldn't really tell, looking at Sofia over the last couple of weeks. Nico had watched her state disintegrate after she was hospitalised with Stage IV lung cancer. Sofia would have been 14 when Bianca had been born, 18 when Nico had surfaced. Sofia had been stunned but convinced when Nico had introduced himself- Maria had always been far too secretive about her lover for Sofia to consider him normal. She'd held onto his shirt and cried and cried that day. Now, Sofia's grip was too weak for her to even hold herself up. It was seeing her in this bad shape that had convinced Nico to finally introduce Will to her. They hit it off like two old friends. Will was kind and open and he listened to her ramblings not just patiently, but with genuine interest. He didn't look awkward or horrified or worried when she had to stop midsentence to cough half a lung out, like Nico was sure he did. He held hands with her longer than Nico could hold hands with anyone in the world. He was the one to kindly suggest that it had been a long day for Zia Sofia, and that she should rest. Sofia beckoned for him to come close and he did; she kissed his cheek. Will waited outside, and Zia Sofia softly whispered to Nico in Italian: tenere a questo. ""Hold on to this one."" ""Lo farò,"" Nico agreed. She coughed again and kissed his own cheek. Nico closed the door on his way out. ""You were so good with her,"" Nico told Will. ""She's cool,"" Will smiled. ""Do I get her blessing? I mean, that's as close to a family blessing as I'm going to get, right?"" Nico smiled. ""I think she was this close to adopting you."" He eased himself on his tiptoes to kiss Will. ""Thank you."" ""For what?"" Will asked. ""For being you,"" Nico said. ""For taking care of people so well. I mean, I know how well you take care of me. But the fact that you can instantly bond with any random Italian senior citizen I bring you to… That's just talent."" ""If we must each bear our crosses, then mine is the burden of talent,"" Will said, spreading his hands. His smile betrayed his role-play. Nico rolled his eyes and took one of them, and didn't let go as they walked back home. He hoped that despite the kidding, Will had really gotten it. Both the thank you and the implied I love you. ""If I do not violate this oath, may I enjoy life and art, respected while I live and remembered with affection thereafter. May I always act so as to preserve the finest traditions of my calling and may I long experience the joy of healing those who seek my help ,"" Nico said. He could nearly feel a wave of heat touch his cheek, as if a cloud had just moved away from the sun- or as if a warm hand rested on his forehead. He closed his eyes. He could nearly feel Will, inches away from his face. He remembered the exact way that Will would be saying; Open your eyes, Nico. Take a deep breath. Think of our happy times. Take care of yourself. Nico opened his eyes. There was a full classroom more of doctors in front of him, all sworn in, ready to make the world a better place. There was roaring applause. There was a good world out there. He could still hear Will, too. Saying; You won't want to miss this. I promise the world will be good to you."

I have mine…"" Lou Ellen didn't dare to believe that that's where they were going. But Miranda brushed aside a low-hanging branch and sure enough, they walked into a garden that would be destroyed if other campers could walk in at their whim. It was full of what looked to Lou Ellen like outdoor doll houses. Wheelbarrows, pots, a bird bath and even tea cups displayed on a little table had all been filled with dirt and all kinds of tiny plants and moss types. But the real impressive part was the tiny furniture. There were swing-sets and ladders and fences made out of twigs and string, toadstools made out of clay and toothpicks, wire and bead wind chimes, wells and houses made with rocks and twigs, popsicle stick doors, twigs out of bent wire, tire swings made out of toy wheels, stepping stone paths made with river stones, clotheslines holding up doll clothing… the variety was amazing. ""Miranda, what's all this?"" Lou said. ""These are fairy gardens,"" Miranda said. ""Remember how I had to start wearing shoes after my family sold the farm to the government? Well, we moved into the city and I had major issues with the cement and the urban everything. So my father used to make these with me all the time when I was little. He said it was to 'keep my thumbs green'. He told me that it was a safe haven for fairies, a kind of hostel. Every year I asked him if fairies were real and every year he said yes, so every year I believed in magic."" Miranda shrugged. ""You ask me why I believe in magic so hard, well here you are,"" she said showing all her tiny gardens. ""I just wanted to show you my kind of magic, or at least how close to them I can get."" The fact that Miranda hid these away made Lou Ellen realise that she didn't show these to just anyone, and that to Miranda Lou was special. ""Thank you,"" she said. ""These are beautiful and adorable."" She smiled. ""You're welcome. But I didn't show you this just because they're cool. I wanted to show you these because… Okay, how do I explain this…"" She took a deep breath. ""Katie and I were talking, and we have a theory. I think that you think that I only hang out with you because of your magic."" Lou Ellen's blood froze in her veins. ""Is it true at all?"" Miranda asked. Lou Ellen didn't know what to answer at first. ""That's how it was when I was little. To the kids at school I was a puzzle. I sat at the popular kids' table on the bench that acted as a curio cabinet. That's how it was in Kronos' Army. We were exhausted, the children of Hecate. Tested and tried until we either died, blew up or went AWOL. It's just what I'm used to. And you get this look on your face, every time I pull a coin from your ear or show you the card you touched in a pack. You love magic. You love having your breath stolen from you and you like feeling wondrous about the world. And it breaks my heart a little, Miranda. It breaks my heart a lot that I'm only an obscure science or an aura reader."" ""Lou Ellen, I don't like your magic. I think that you're magic."" Miranda said. ""I think you're incredible and breath-taking and enigmatic and wonderful and interesting and unique- so, so unique."" Lou Ellen nearly wanted to shake your head. ""You're just always doing magic, Lou,"" Miranda said. ""As your safety blanket. As a way to get rid of spare energy. Talking magic was a way that I could make you talk to me and open up. I'm not surprised that you can't see the difference, but I can. There's Lou, and then there's Lou's magic. I love them both, but I wanted to show you these gardens to prove to you that I don't look for you around camp or make faces at you during camp fires because of the magic. I have my own source of magic, since I was little. I do it because you're Lou Ellen."" Lou didn't answer. ""You're not convinced,"" Miranda said. ""No,"" Lou Ellen admitted freely. ""What do I have to do to convince you?"" Miranda asked. That's when Lou read her aura. See, the thing about auras was that if someone's aura changed subtly, and you saw them every day, you didn't register the change. It was like putting a frog in a pot of water over a stove top and cranking the temperature up a bit at a time. The frog didn't notice the temperature until it was dead. Lou saw a red tint around Miranda's aura, but not the angry red one. Nothing mean or negative like anger. Something soft. Something good. She grabbed the daughter of Demeter by the back of her head and smashed her lips to her. Surprised at first, Miranda tensed, but then she kissed back. Her lips parted a little bit and her hands too flew up to Lou Ellen's hands. Her energy too became soft and giddy at once. Her fingers too knotted in Lou's hair as if she never wanted to let go. When they did, they both panted, looking at each other. ""Okay, I'm convinced,"" Lou said. ""Oh good,"" Miranda said. ""Because I wasn't going to go long without doing that again."" She pulled Lou Ellen back to her.

Four hours later… ""I think she's finally done crying,"" Katniss said from where she lay. Peeta plopped down next to her on the mattress. ""And, Liam has finally decided to go to bed."" He looked over at his friend and smiled tiredly. ""I don't know how you do it."" ""Patience,"" his friend replied. ""Lots of patience."" Katniss' eyes fluttered in exhaustion. ""Let's just rest our eyes for a quick minute."" Peeta closed his eyes. ""Agreed."" Since arriving back from the airport, Peeta and Katniss had been juggling taking care of both the kids. For a bit, he and Liam helped the teething Charlie by holding the cold ring to her sore gums. He switched off with Katniss so that he could prepare grilled cheese sandwiches at Liam's request for dinner and the three of them had eaten in the nursery. Then as Katniss bathed Liam, he had rocked Charlie until she fell asleep. When it was time for Liam to go to bed, Charlie woke up and so Katniss went to her daughter as he shuffled to Liam's room, where the little boy showed him his entire collection of Ninja Turtles memorabilia and proudly displayed his present from Peeta at the center of it all. Now, here he and Katniss were at the brink of exhaustion. Then the wail from Charlie's room came. He stood up, not even thinking about his tiredness. ""I'll go."" ""Thank you, love,"" Katniss mumbled, half-asleep. ""You might as well marry me,"" Peeta told her. ""Because, this is pretty much how I imagine it."" Katniss waved him off. ""Yeah…yeah…"" Standing up, he went to Charlie's nursery, a large meringue-yellow colored room and picked up the tired baby. Cradling her close, Peeta sat down in the rocking chair next to her crib. ""I know it hurts, sweetheart."" He pressed his lips to her forehead. ""The good thing is that your fever is down…and soon you'll feel much better and have a new set of chompers."" ""Peeta?"" He looked up to see Liam in the doorway. The little boy went to Peeta, crawling onto the free space on his lap. ""Can't sleep."" ""What can I do to help you?"" Peeta asked the little one. ""Tell me a story?"" Liam suggested tiredly as he settled his head onto Peeta's chest. ""How about I tell you about the first time that I met your Mommy?"" he said and the little boy nodded in agreement. ""I was about your age and it was my first day of Kindergarten. Our teacher had us sit in a circle and then asked who knew the Valley song, which is Panem's town song. And, your Mommy's hand just shot up."" Liam yawned. ""Really?"" ""Yeah."" Peeta grinned as he caressed the boy's head and pressed his lips to Charlie's forehead. ""She was wearing a red dress and her hair was in two braids instead of one. Your Mommy just stood right up and belted out that song like there was no tomorrow."" His eyes went to the doorway where he found Katniss watching them, her gaze focused on him. Peeta met her eyes. ""And, her singing was so beautiful that even the birds outside our classroom window stopped singing to listen. I just knew then that I couldn't live my life without having her in it. That I was just meant to love her for the rest of my life."" Looking down, he realized that both of the children were asleep. Katniss reached for Charlie. ""I'll put her to bed. You can take care of the little man."" Nodding, he stood up, cradling the sleeping boy and carried Liam out of the room. Going next door, Peeta placed him in his bed and pulled the blanket over the little one. Leaning down, Peeta kissed the boy's forehead. ""Goodnight…son."" Getting up from the bed, he went to the door and shut off the light before going into the hallway. There, Katniss was waiting for him. Her smoky eyes beckoned him and he went to her. ""Peeta—"" His hands reached to cradle her face and Peeta drew her close, pressing his mouth to hers insistently. Katniss yielded, her mouth opening as she let his tongue plunder hers and taste what he had craved for as long as he could remember. And, Peeta knew he was where he was always meant to be. Backing her against the wall, Katniss bucked against his pelvis, a quiet moan escaping her mouth as she moved her hot center against his own to create a friction that had him aching to be inside her. If she kept on, Peeta knew he would be unable to hold back. He would take her right there against the wall. But, his concern for their children overpowered his lust. ""Should we be doing this here?"" he whispered as his mouth moved to her neck and his lips sucked at her sweet skin. She arched against him, small pants escaping her lips. ""Let's go to our room."" He planted a kiss on her chin before pulling away slightly. ""Our room?"" She nodded, her hand reaching to the nape of his neck to pull him in for another kiss. ""Hell yes, our room."" One Year Later… ""Can I help you?"" The saleswoman asked Peeta. ""Yes,"" he replied and looked down at Liam. ""My son and I were having 'Guy Time' and he wanted us to look for something for his mother. It's her birthday."" ""That's adorable,"" the woman gushed. ""What are you looking for, sweetheart?"" ""I want to get my Mommy a necklace."" Then, he pointed to Peeta. ""And, he wants to get her an engagement ring. Especially since Mommy is having my little brother—and doesn't want anyone to see him through her wedding dress."" He stifled a laugh; sometimes Liam could be a little too observant. But, Peeta wouldn't have him any other way. Meeting the woman's amused eyes, he nodded. ""Lead the way."" FIN."

Trust me when I tell you that Rye will protect your heart with everything he has. And, you're a lot braver than me, Prim."" Peeta looked to Katniss once more. ""I should've trusted her more. Because the girl I lost would have fought tooth and nail to protect my heart."" He met Prim's eyes. ""Prove me wrong, Prim. Show me that people like us can have a happy ending."" Giving her space, Peeta waited for her response. After a moment, Prim spoke. ""Okay."" She was grinning from ear to ear, her tears rushing steadily down her cheeks. ""Let's go back!"" Peeta rushed over to her, picking the girl up, and twirling her. She laughed, the sound of it watered with happy tears. The girls in the car clapped, all wiping their eyes. As Prim got back into the car, Peeta caught Katniss' eyes. 'Good job,' she mouthed, beaming at him. He nodded before getting into the car. ""Hi, I'm Peeta Mellark,"" he began. ""And, I'm the Best Man."" There was a series of whoops and hollers. ""I guess my reputation precedes me."" The wedding party rippled with laughter. ""I'm supposed to give a speech about love and such."" Peeta looked around before his eyes fell upon Prim and Rye, who were glowing. The ceremony had gone off without a hitch and even his eyes misted seeing his brother slip the wedding band onto Prim's finger. ""But, I'm no expert,"" Peeta continued. He looked to Rye. ""My brother, however—he embodies the word. Rye loves without fear or restraint. He does it unrepentantly. Big brothers are supposed to teach their little brothers things. I did the best I could and tried to give him the wisdom that I knew. I never realized that he was teaching me, too."" He took a breath before raising his glass. ""So this is to my brother, Rye,"" he said, choking back his tears. ""The best teacher I know."" He looked to Prim. ""And to Prim, because she is oh so brave to be taking the Mellark brothers on. I love you both. Salut!"" The crowd clapped uproariously as his brother and Prim hugged him. He whispered his 'I love you's' into their ears before sitting down next to Katniss. ""You owe me a dance, Everdeen,"" Peeta said as he met her eyes. ""Later, Mellark,"" Katniss responded, her own stare steady and her smile teasing. ""If you can find me."" Peeta left Effie with Plutarch, an old comrade of Mr. Everdeen's and as they continued their conversation, he stepped out of the crowded ballroom using one of the trick doors that led into the courtyard. The night was clear, the zenith of stars spread above him and he wished for hope on all of them before approaching Katniss, who sat on the old swing set. She looked up hearing his footsteps in the snow and smiled softly. ""I knew that you'd find me."" ""You find comfort in good memories,"" Peeta said as he sat on the swing next to her. ""I wanted to show you something."" He pulled his camera strap over his head and turned on the DSLR camera. Pressing play, Peeta shuffled through the photos before stopping on the one he wanted to present to Katniss. ""This is my favorite photo out of all of them."" Katniss laughed seeing the picture. ""You should've been paying more attention to the ceremony."" It was a close-up of Katniss smiling at him during the wedding. The green gown complemented her complexion. However, her smile was what made his heart leap from his chest; it was lovely and full of hope. He saw their children in that smile. ""I thought I'd print it out,"" he said carefully. Reaching into his pocket, he pulled out his wallet and rifled through it before presenting to her the most priceless thing inside of it. ""And, put it next to this photo."" Katniss took it, her eyes staring down at the faded photo of her eight-year-old self. She swallowed slowly. ""You kept it,"" she whispered thickly. ""I thought you let me go."" Peeta shook his head as he placed his camera on the ground. Standing up, he faced her before kneeling down. ""I couldn't,"" he said. ""You were always in my heart, Katniss. I think I protected it for so long because you filled most of it. I don't know what's going to happen, but I swear that if you decide one day to spend your life with me, I will be there for you every waking day. I made all the choices when it came to us. Now it's your turn. "" Peeta lifted her chin, seeing the crystalline tears. ""Tonight after this wedding is over and we go to bed, I'll leave my door unlocked for you,"" Peeta told her. ""If you come in and lay down with me, then that's it. We can both expect to spend the rest of our days in that very same way…together."" Peeta took a nervous breath. ""And, if you don't, then it's okay. But, I'm never going to stop pursuing you, Katniss. I'm always going to be hoping that you come to me, lay your head on my chest, and let me hold you till we're both asleep like that first night. I'm not letting you go. Not now. Not ever."" Peeta waited, the air still around them. ""They're playing our song,"" Katniss suddenly said. She stood up, tears rolling down her cheeks and a gentle smile on her lips. ""You owe me a dance."" "" Those three words Are said too much They're not enough… "" Peeta smiled, his own eyes watering as he pulled her close. ""I've been waiting for this dance."" ""Me, too,"" she replied thickly as they began to sway. "" If I lay here If I just lay here Would you lie with me and just forget the world ?"" FIN."

""No, it was just a horrible thing that happened,"" Peeta said. ""But maybe now we can make things a little better for Mari."" She nodded. ""Give me a little time with them?"" ""You can have as much time as you want,"" Peeta assured her. ""I'll be outside here if you need me."" Hazelle nodded before leaning over to give a motherly kiss on the cheek. ""Congratulations, Dad."" He smiled. ""Congratulations, Grandma Hazelle."" Two Months Later… "" Give your all to me I'll give my all to you You're my end and my beginning Even when I lose I'm winning 'Cause I give you all of me…"" ""I know. Daddy isn't much of a singer."" Peeta offered the bottle to their daughter, who eagerly reached for it. ""But, I can bake you a good cake."" From behind the door, Katniss leaned against the wall watching Peeta and Mari's nighttime ritual. He always sang to her before giving her a bottle and then putting her down to bed. ""Don't drink too fast, sweetheart,"" Peeta cooed to the little girl in his arms. ""You'll get the hiccups and I know how much you hate those."" Mari hummed in agreement, her sounds muffled by the fact that she was currently sucking on the rubber nipple of the bottle Peeta held. ""That's it, Daddy's got you."" Katniss' chest constricted seeing the protective hold of her husband. ""I will always take care of you, my little Mari. As long as there are breaths in my body, Daddy will always take care of you and Mommy."" Mari stared up at him, fascinated by her father's voice. She reached for him and Peeta brushed a kiss on her tiny fingers. ""There's so much of Gale in you,"" Peeta whispered. ""Your boldness and that strength in your eyes; that is all your father. I see your Mommy in you, too. You have her curiosity and bravery, not to mention her beauty. Don't tell her but even as a little boy, I already knew I was a goner."" He pressed a kiss to Mari's forehead. ""I hope you get something from me one day."" Katniss felt her eyes water up at his words, so sweet and tender to their little girl. Not wanting to disturb the two, she went back to bed to await her husband. When Peeta came to bed, the lights were already out and he quietly slipped under the blanket to rest before Mari woke them for her 3AM feeding. ""Peeta?"" He turned to see Katniss staring at him, her coal eyes glittering in the darkness and his memory wandered to that late night on the back porch of the frat house. She had looked at him that same way. Only now did he realize what that look was—it was hunger. It was love. ""Yes, sweetheart?"" Peeta said into the gentle silence. ""I love you,"" she whispered, her head going to his chest. ""Always."" ""Is this real?"" he asked, his voice low and causing her center to tighten. Katniss sat up to face him. Her hands went to the noose of her robe and she slowly undid the ties before revealing her body to his longing eyes. She had some stretch marks and had not lost all of her baby weight but she could see that her husband appreciated her body. It had brought their child into the world. Hopefully one day, it would bring more. Taking his hand, she moved it along her shoulder before letting his rough palm find its way to where her heart pulsed in anticipation. ""Real."" Katniss leaned down, her lips teasing his. ""I intend to show you just how much until Mari's next feeding."" ""I might need some confirmation a little after the feeding,"" Peeta said with a smile. Katniss let out a laugh before covering his mouth in a full kiss. Three years later… They played in a field. The dark-haired girl with mismatched clothes and messy pigtails, screaming in delight as she was swung about. If there was anything that she got from Peeta, it was her zest for life. Then there was the man with golden hair and eyes so blue that Katniss often found herself drowning in them, especially when they made love in the quiet hours before dawn. ""Mommy!"" Mari rushed towards her with a small bouquet of dandelions in her small grasp. ""Pretty like you!"" ""Thank you, baby!"" She took the flowers before giving her daughter a kiss. Mari sat next to Katniss, snuggling to her side. Her eyes then went to Peeta who approached, his eyes full as he stared at her. ""Don't I get a present from you, too?"" ""I suppose,"" Peeta responded easily. He reached into the picnic basket in the corner of their blanket. ""How about this?"" Her eyes went to the green crayon wrapped in his grasp and Katniss let out a laugh. ""About time!"" she exclaimed before grabbing the bit of crayon revealed in Peeta's hold. Her husband winked at her before letting go of it. The laughter dropped from her lips seeing at what rested on the other end of the crayon—a delicate band crowned with a bright canary diamond. ""I thought that we'd renew our vows,"" Peeta said. ""You could wear a wedding dress…or a burlap sack…I could care less—as long as you'll marry me…again."" ""Okay,"" Katniss breathed out. She watched him slip the ring on her finger, feeling the onset of tears beginning. In time, these hormones would only get more erratic, but she knew they could handle it—just like last time. Katniss took his hand, placing it over the slight swell, before meeting his overjoyed eyes. ""Should we get married before or after your son is born?"" FIN. Songs: ""All of Me""-John Legend I think it's dependent on how you pronounce, 'Amaryllis' but in my head, the correct pronunciation of 'Mari' is 'MAH-ri'. Thanks for reading!"

""I bet you didn't think that you'd be stuck with someone like me this weekend."" ""True,"" he responded bluntly. ""But, we're stuck with each other. So what are we going to do about it?"" ""I'm going to go home and dive head-first into some Ben and Jerry's—"" Katniss informed him. ""—while you continue living your billionaire life and forget about the pathetic office girl that you rescued."" ""Or, we can get some revenge,"" Peeta suggested, a wicked glint in his eye. Katniss looked at him in bewilderment. ""What?"" ""Your girlfriend is very lovely, Mr. Mellark,"" the saleswoman said as they stood outside the dressing room of the resort's sole clothing shop. ""A diamond in the rough."" ""Did she resist your choices?"" Peeta asked in an amused voice. It had been Katniss' mode of rebellion—first at the salon, then the Manolo Blahnik boutique, and now at the dress shop that he was waiting in. ""About every one of them,"" the woman responded with a slight smirk. ""Until she found this dress—"" ""Peeta?"" His eyes went to the vision in front of him. Katniss stood in a sleek emerald-green gown along with silver sandals on her tiny feet. Her dark hair fell in elegant waves onto her bare shoulders and her face was simply made-up to only accentuate her pretty features, sans her glasses. ""Do I look like a total tool?"" she asked. Peeta shook his head, a proud grin on his face. ""No…"" He lifted her chin. ""Just remember that no one can make you feel bad unless you allow them to. Hold your head up, Katniss. You are a strong woman and tonight, my dinner date."" ""How did you know that Marvel would be there?"" They sat in front of the resort's crystalline steps. Carefully, Katniss slipped her very expensive heels off to stretch her toes out. ""Simple. I had him tracked,"" Peeta said as he sat back. ""My men told me exactly where he was squiring his girl. However, it's safe to say that he's really regretting letting you go now."" Katniss laughed. ""Doesn't matter anyway."" She reached into her small purse and pulled out her glasses to put them back on. ""Tomorrow, I'm heading back to reality. It really isn't all that bad. Truthfully, I like who I am."" Peeta gave her solemn nod. ""You should."" He sighed to himself. ""I'll be heading back home...single once more."" ""Sorry about your girlfriend,"" she responded sympathetically. ""I think that things will work out. You have the money to fly over to New York. You two can make it work."" ""I guess,"" Peeta said. ""The thing is…Madge knows that and still dumped me. So I know that this has nothing to do with distance and all to do with us."" Katniss gave him a smile. ""At least you helped a nobody get sweet revenge on her supposed beau. The look on his face when Marvel saw me walk in—I can see how spite would work for me."" ""Don't become me,"" Peeta told her. ""I'm not all good."" The woman stared at him for a moment. She suddenly reached into her bag and met his eyes. ""I think you are."" Katniss held out the small circular object to him. ""My grandmother gave this to me. It's a Mockingjay pin. She told me that it would bring me luck."" She flipped the pin over, revealing the bird, wings spread along the pin to him before placing it in his palm. ""You see, I don't believe that there's really luck in it. I do believe that there's hope, all the hopes that my grandmother had for me. Now it has all the hopes I have for you—live a love-filled life, Peeta."" His limo pulled up and Peeta stood up with the pin in his hand. ""Thank you."" Katniss smiled at him and his breath caught seeing how it lit up her heart-shaped face. ""You're welcome."" Two Months Later… ""Why is everyone freaking out?"" Katniss asked Delly as she sat down at her desk next to her friend. ""The big boss is coming,"" Delly responded. ""How are you feeling?"" ""Better. Can't seem to shake off this stomach bug though,"" she responded before reaching into her desk to grab some more Tums. ""We both seem to be having a sick day,"" Delly informed her. ""Aunt Flo has come to town and she brought my cousins, Bloaty and Bitchy. Do you have any feminine products?"" ""Bottom drawer,"" Katniss replied as she logged back onto her computer. Delly rummaged through her friend's drawer before jumping from her chair. ""I'll be right back. Have to freshen up before Peeta Mellark arrives!"" Katniss froze at the name, her stomach clenching. It had been two months since she heard that name…two months since she woke up to said man spooning her naked body. And, two months since her period. A cold rush ran through her body at her sudden realization. Had it really been two months? She quickly reached into her purse and pulled out her planner to look for her most recent period date mark. There was none. Crap. She was having Peeta Mellark's baby. To be continued… To my detriment, I have started another story. This was actually a story written for Fandom4LLS. Thank you if you were one of the people who donated to such a great cause! I ask that you be patient. I'm hoping to have the next chapter out next week but keep in mind that I'm juggling this story, North Star, and This I Promise You. Plus, I work and real-life stuff. Feedback would be awesome if you have the time—a favorite, follow, or subscribe are also great!

""How do we get out of this?"" Madge asks bluntly. I laugh in spite of the situation. ""We'll speak in private about your question."" I nod slightly at the Avox behind me, some of them are trustworthy but others will do anything for mercy. ""How do we figure out what to do to impress the Gamemakers?"" Madge looks to me. ""I mean, what am I supposed to do? Knit them sweaters?"" ""You're fast,"" Katniss suddenly says. ""You have good instincts and you know how to pay attention to detail. I remember when we all used to play together in school. You were the fastest runner. Also, you always knew what was happening around you. No one could trick you in school. And, knitting requires a lot of attention. What's the difference between doing that and being able to spot the distinct weave of a forcefield?"" I look to our nervous male Tribute. ""You're smart, Adam. You have a good memory from what you've told me. You can feed yourself in the Arena because you'll be able to identify what's edible and what's poisonous. You'll learn to heal yourself once you have a good gauge on what's around you as well."" ""Thanks,"" Madge says softly, her eyes going between Katniss and me. ""I know this isn't easy for either one of you."" Katniss shoots up from her seat, her face going completely grey. She's going to be sick. Quickly, Madge takes the bowl of fruit in front of her and tosses the contents out before handing it to Katniss. My wife grabs it and immediately she is throwing up into the crystalline bowl, filling it with what little she's had for breakfast and sour bile. ""What's wrong with her?"" Effie asks in panic. ""Should I have a Capitol doctor ready when we arrive?"" Haymitch turns to the Avox in the room. ""Get out!"" She scrambles out quickly, leaving us alone. Finally, Katniss stops retching and even when she protests, I scoop her up and bring her to the couch. The rest follow anxiously, breakfast abandoned as well as the bowl of her vomit on the table. ""Here."" Adam hands Katniss a glass of water with a green leaf floating atop. ""Mint will help with calming your stomach."" She takes the glass, sipping slowly, before giving him a smile. ""Thank you."" Madge grins at us. ""You two have a lot of trouble ahead of you!"" Her eyes go to Katniss' swell. ""You're pregnant?"" Effie cries out, her eyes lighting up. Katniss nods reluctantly. ""Yes."" ""Our Victor is having a baby! Can you imagine?"" Effie gushes in excitement. ""Everyone will be in a frenzy! The celebrations for you two will be phenomenal and the invitations to your baby shower—"" ""Effie, please!"" Katniss stands up from the couch and goes to our escort, her eyes desperate. ""No one can know. Peeta and I are just barely wrapping our minds around the fact that we're having a child...let alone two."" Effie's light eyes widen at her words. ""Think, if Snow knows...the danger we'll be in. Madge and Adam are targets...Haymitch...even you."" She takes my former escort's hand, placing it to the spot where our children rest. ""And, especially them. I lost my sister, even Peeta for a bit. I can't lose anyone else."" They look at one another, communicating silently, before Effie lets out a sigh. ""I will talk to Cinna and Portia,"" she tells Katniss after a moment. ""I'm sure they'll love thinking of creative designs for your maternity wear. The empire waist is coming back into fashion so the children will be coming at a most opportune time in Capitol fashion."" Effie cups Katniss' cheek affectionately. ""Dear girl...don't worry so much. We will protect you."" ""I don't care about what happens to me,"" Katniss says in a quiet voice. ""I care about the babies...about our family."" She looks over to me and I join her side, taking her hand. ""And, I care about all of you, too."" ""Of course,"" Effie says thickly. She gives us all a trembling smile, her eyes briefly lingering on Haymitch before looking to me and Katniss. ""We're a team."" There is a single beep from the intercom and I look to Katniss. ""We're close."" ""What do you mean?"" she asks. As I lead her to a nearby window, Adam and Madge follow behind us. They gasp collectively at the sight and Katniss places her hand to the window ledge, leaning in to get a closer view. I can understand the awe, remembering the first time I saw the gathering of metallic high-rises against the mountainous backdrop; it doesn't seem so threatening from a distance. However like a hunter and its prey, I fear that we won't know that we are captured until we are in the middle of the trap. The Capitol. So ends chapter one. I hope you are enjoying so far. It's going to be an interesting canon-divergence and I always love playing around with this kind of genre. For all those who want to know and have asked, Prim won't be coming back in any form other than in dreams and memories. I know we all loved her, but she's really gone to a better place. Also, it's time for Katniss and Peeta to learn how to be on their own in some way and learn to work as a couple. They need to be a family because trust that Snow will try to destroy them. Adam and Madge are interesting because they are actually very strong as team. Also, they will be very popular. As for Gale and Madge...they will talk. Anyway, thank you for your support. I hope that you review, follow, favorite, and subscribe. Feedback is always welcome! Next, Chapter Two: The Mellarks and the Capitol Until the next chapter, JLaLa"

""I'll have a lot of things to keep me preoccupied so the time will pass quickly."" We still haven't finished unpacking. Also, classes start in a week and I've also been filling my time with shifts at the bar. I continue to list all the things for me to do in my head to keep myself from coming to terms with the fact that Cato will be leaving for a cross-country journey for a whole month. And, that I will be all alone. ""What are you thinking?"" Cato whispers into my ear. I turn to meet those sweet blue eyes. I haven't been able to lie to Cato since we were kids. He could always tell that I was keeping something from him. ""A month,"" I say to him. ""A lot can happen in a month."" ""I'm going to be traveling in a rickety old van and climbing to temples,"" Cato replies. ""You're going to be in school and at work. The time will pass and before you know it—I'm going to be home and in your arms."" Together, we lay back on the soft mattress and I'm spooned against Cato. His heart beats against my back and press myself into him to memorize those beats coming from his firm chest. ""It's going to be boring here,"" I whine. ""Is that your way of saying you're going to miss me?"" Cato asks and I chuckle at his teasing words. Before long, he is laying me on my back to press his lips to mine. My arms encircle around his neck as he urgently begins to tug at the leggings I wear. ""Promise that you will."" My legs part eagerly as soon as Cato throws my leggings, along with my panties, to the ground—and then, he is thrusting quickly into me. My back arches as the pleasure spikes up my chest and causes my nipples to tighten. ""I'll miss you…and this…"" I tell him as his hand reaches to yank my shirt up and his lips go immediately to a rosy peak. ""More…please!"" My eyes meet his and I'm surprised at the tenderness in his. His eyes usually go feral during our lovemaking. ""Make me forget that you're leaving…"" I'm surprised by the sadness in my voice; I've never been a sentimentalist. Cato slows and he kisses me, hooking my leg over his hip. ""I'm going to make sure that you never forget this moment, Katniss."" He begins to pick up his pace. ""Because when I come back, we're going to have a talk about us. You're it for me—no one else. You just have to remember that every day that I'm gone."" The words don't seem real. I know I love Cato, but this all feels likes too much. So instead of responding, I put my hand to the nape of his neck to silence him once more with my kiss. ""I'll call as soon as I land,"" Cato assures me, two days later. It's nearly sundown as I walk him out to his cab. I try to smile at his excitement but I'm disheartened by it, too. This whole Manhattan move was something that we were supposed to experience together. ""Be safe,"" I tell him and my arms reach to wrap around his neck to pull him in for a kiss. ""Don't fall in love with any cute tour guides."" Cato chuckles. ""Don't go falling in love with anyone, either."" His eyes look over my shoulder. ""Make sure of that for me, Peeta!"" I turn to see our roommate walking over to us; his shift at the bakery must have just ended. ""Make sure none of those Juilliard boys get near my girl."" We separate so that he can shake Peeta's hand. ""Katniss will be fine,"" Peeta assures him. His eyes wander over to me and he gives me a smile. ""She's a lot braver than she thinks."" ""Don't I know it,"" Cato replies. ""I better go. I have to meet my team at JFK in an hour."" Kissing me one last time, he hops into his cab and I watch it speed away until it disappears down the block. ""I mean it."" Turning, I see Peeta beside me. ""You're a lot braver than you think."" ""You don't know me,"" I say to him. ""So how would you know how brave I can be?"" ""Just have a feeling about you,"" Peeta tells me. ""Like you're just on the verge of finding what makes you…you."" He gives me a smile. ""When it does, I hope I'm there to see it."" I nod before looking out into the direction where Cato's cab disappeared. Finally, I look to him. ""Before that happens, do you want to grab something to eat?"" Peeta stares at me for a moment before a bright grin breaks out on his lips. He looks much younger when he smiles that way and something in me stirs at seeing it. This is not good. I shouldn't be staring so hard at someone who isn't my boyfriend. But, I'll have to learn to deal with the enigma that is Peeta Mellark. Because, he is my roommate—and right now, my only friend in Manhattan. ""Sure,"" he responds. ""Do you like pizza?"" I snort. ""You really don't know me,"" I say. My lips rise in a proud smile. ""I can eat a whole pizza by myself!"" He puts an arm around me and leads me down the block. ""Now this I have to see."" Just a new little something I'm working on. This began as ""Last Words"" prompt and now has spiraled into this. Like all of my trademark fics, the title comes from a song—from one of my favorite artists, Ben Folds. It's going to be a difficult process to Everlark, I assure you.

Peeta asked her, his blue eyes hopeful. She liked seeing that in his eyes—hope. ""I think that you should tell them that we'll meet them at City Hall at noon then join me in the shower,"" Katniss responded before placing a gentle kiss on his lips. She went back upstairs, letting out a laugh as Peeta demanded that the Hawthornes leave the house. Panem High's gym was filled with Peeta's old classmates and he grinned seeing the pictures hanging along the walls, each one bringing back joyful memories of his senior year. He turned to Katniss who looked around in awe. She never had a high school reunion as most of her schooling had been done by correspondence. ""How are you doing, Mrs. Mellark?"" he asked as he lifted her hand to kiss the top of it. The class ring looked huge on her long finger but she had burst into tears when he slipped it back on her finger during their ceremony. He would be returning her Tiffany's set to find something that was more her when they got back home. ""I'm great,"" she told him. ""I can barely remember how my high school looked. I had to leave halfway through my freshman year."" ""Don't worry, Katniss,"" Gale said as he joined her and Peeta along with Madge. ""I have more than enough stories to tell you about high school…and about Peeta."" ""Don't make me change my mind about letting you be my Best Man,"" Peeta retorted. ""Please…I can tell you stories about this whole class that will make you cringe,"" Madge said. ""Peeta! Gale!"" Finnick rushed over to them, breathless but striking in his black suit. ""You'll never guess who's here!"" Peeta bit back a smile at Finnick's excitement. ""Who?"" ""Thresh! His wife had the baby—a son, by the way, and then she shooed him back here for the reunion,"" Finnick told them with a smile. ""You know what that means."" Peeta and Gale turned to their wives eagerly. ""Can we?"" Peeta asked. ""Please?"" Gale added. ""You two look like the most pathetic puppies I've ever seen,"" Katniss told them, a smile on her red lips. ""I don't know what you're doing but just go!"" Peeta and Gale each gave their wives a kiss before rushing away with Finnick. ""What did I just allow them to do?"" she asked Madge as they walked into the gym. They spotted Annie and waved before walking towards her. ""Did Peeta ever tell you about our varsity talent show?"" Madge asked her and Katniss shook her head. ""All the varsity teams had to do some sort of performance and well…"" As they reached Annie, the lights of the gym dimmed as music filled the large gymnasium. Katniss looked at the stage in front of her where Peeta, Gale, Finnick and a dark-skinned man who she assumed was Thresh moved in a choreographed dance. They all did a synchronized twirl and the class erupted in cheers seeing the foursome back together. All of them were in their football uniforms. Her husband stood in the middle, mic in his hand and as their eyes met, he blew her a kiss. "" You're sweet as a honeybee…but like a honeybee stings…you've gone and left my heart in pain…"" Ten Months Later… ""Peeta, our daughter is so cute that I think I might just throw up,"" Katniss said as she wiped the bit of drool from the corner of Ivy's chin. ""I mean these cheeks and her hair...I hope her eyes stay blue."" ""You weren't saying that two days ago,"" Peeta responded with a chuckle. ""I mean you fractured my hand."" ""I can't be held accountable for what I did while in labor,"" she retorted. Her eyes met his through the rearview mirror. ""Are you really mad?"" ""Not at all,"" he told her. ""It's a good thing that it wasn't my drawing hand."" ""Yes, it's also fortunate that you own the firm,"" Katniss responded with a smile. Things had changed since they returned home from the reunion. Peeta had decided to approach his firm with his own designs. When Plutarch didn't feel the need to take any of them into account despite their quality and innovative styles, he decided to leave. Three months later, Peeta had opened his own firm—in Panem. Beetee had been his consultant and when the man retired, he recommended an up and coming business manager to help Peeta. Johanna Mason had found Peeta a good office space and helped hire interns to get his team going. She and Katniss had a similar business mindset so the two got along well. He had to slow down once Katniss confirmed that she was pregnant. She had an inkling once they returned home, due to their impromptu game of 'Cheerleader and Football Player' after the reunion, that she was pregnant. Peeta came home one night to ten pregnancy tests lined up on their bathroom counter—all of them were positive. ""It means that I get to spend more time with you and Ivy,"" he responded as they pulled up to the driveway of their house. The dream house that had been Peeta's first design was his six-month anniversary present to her. Since there was plenty of space in Panem, Madge, who was a realtor, found the lot close to the main street for Peeta to begin construction. The four-bedroom colonial house with green window shutters for their growing family. Peeta could almost see Ivy running around the large lawn in front of it. Carefully, Katniss unstrapped the baby seat before handing it carefully to Peeta and then stepping out. ""You alright?"" Peeta asked as he put an arm around her, his functional hand holding Ivy's carrier. She looked up in the house before giving him a smile. ""I'm just happy to be home.""

Even if we've only just met, I've known her from lifetimes before. So you should shoot me instead, I don't think I was even alive until I met her. I don't want to be in a world without her."" ""Oh fucking hell,"" Johanna mutters. Two shots go off. It's been five years since the murders of Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark. They say it was a jealous ex-boyfriend, the amount of blood at the crime scene so gruesome that several police officers were sick to their stomachs. Someone had beaten their faces in so badly that they were practically unrecognizable. They were deemed ""Star-Crossed Lovers"" by the papers, their short relationship showing so much promise. Who knew what could have happened if they survived the massacre? Maybe they would've married, had children, and raised them in Panem until they grew old. Maybe they would've traveled the world, finally settling on their dream home, and married under the light of the moon. They were mourned by thousands, people driving into the small town of Panem and packing into the church where they were eulogized. Katniss has been a kind-hearted girl with humanitarian ideals while Peeta had been a pillar of strength to the town, dedicated to his students. There was talk that it was all a set-up by Burton Cray, who Peeta was planning to testify against. Cray laughed it off knowing that there was no way to connect him to the killing since he was in jail at the time. Confidently, he believed that he would be getting off scot-free. Unfortunately, Cray didn't think of Peeta transcribing his account of Cray smuggling children into the States to sell for a variety of reasons, including prostitution and slavery. Ten video tapes of Peeta at his home describing the events were found along with the signed affidavit by his lawyer, Marvel Smith, who presented the tapes on the day of the trial. Cray is currently doing ten consecutive lifetime sentences. Who knew what Katniss and Peeta could have been? I know. I know who they are. My mind pulls back from the memories as the boat that I stand on, starts to slow. ""Ma'am?"" I turn to the attendant. ""We're about to dock. Do you have bags in the stowaway, Miss…?"" ""Everdeen,"" I respond. ""Primrose Everdeen."" I shake my head at him. ""I only have this."" I hold up my small duffle. ""Are you visiting family?"" I look out at the dock where a dark-haired woman and blond man wave at me. Jumping excitedly in front of them is a little girl with eyes so blue that I can see them even from the mile or two that separate us from land. ""My sister and brother-in-law,"" I respond simply. ""My sister is expecting a baby any day now and someone has to keep my niece busy."" The man smiles at me, his dark eyes looking over at me appreciatively. I'm only 15, but I know that I exude a bit of wisdom and mystery in me. My sister taught me well. She taught me how to act distraught, how to pretend to identify her ""body"" at the morgue. How to keep a straight face over the fact that Beetee and Wiress were able to place her and Peeta's DNA as well as fingerprints in cadavers stolen from some place that we'd rather not know about. ""They are lucky to have you then,"" the man replies. ""No one ever comes to this island. There are only two boat trips out here annually."" ""I don't plan on leaving for a while,"" I respond as the boat begins to dock. ""Our eldest sister is on her honeymoon right now anyway and I live with her so I'd rather hang out here than be in that large house by myself."" Johanna's rather quickie marriage to Marvel was due to the fact that both were celebrating their promotions at the Academy and had a little too much to drink, causing neither to realize that the sterility shots we were given were no longer lingering in their systems. Haymitch and Effie are currently watching their twins as the newlyweds explore Rome. ""Aunt Prim!"" Waving goodbye to the attendant, I quickly pick up the dark-haired four-year-old as soon as I step onto the dock. ""Miss Amelia Adele!"" I kiss her cheeks as she blanches at my use of both of her names. ""How are you?"" ""I can climb a tree by myself,"" Mia responds proudly. ""Not that we let her,"" Katniss tells me as she pulls me into a hug. ""You're getting tall."" ""You're getting huge,"" I retort and she gives me the finger behind Mia's back. ""Well, it's Peeta's baby,"" she responds before looking at her husband affectionately. ""All legs. What did you expect?"" Peeta takes my bag before drawing me into a strong hug. ""I wasn't the one walking around in a new bikini, eight months ago."" ""This is all Johanna's fault then!"" I conclude as we walk towards the small home in the tiny borough of District 12. Johanna during her travels often presents me or Katniss with lovely clothing pieces. I saw the barely there bikini before Johanna sent it and I definitely don't have the breasts to fill it. Katniss does and Peeta obviously appreciates this fact. ""Isn't it always?"" Katniss responds. Her hand goes to her stomach before she puts an arm around me. ""Though thank goodness, she's so good at ballistic shooting."" Precise enough that the police didn't even bat an eyelash at the distance logistics or suspect any foul play, giving Katniss and Peeta enough time to flee the country. In front of us, Peeta and Mia, who is sitting on her father's shoulders, sing "" Rolling in the Deep "" in Spanish. ""Yeah."" I rest my head on my sister's shoulder. ""Thank goodness."" FIN.

In the far reaches of his mind, Peeta had often wondered how soft her hair was. ""Will you teach me how to do this?"" His cheeks warmed as the question tumbled from his mouth. ""For when Joy is older?"" Katniss stared at him for a moment before wordlessly pulling the elastic band from her hair. ""Sit,"" she said to him and he followed as she sat on the ground of the hospital roof. She turned to him and he marveled at how pretty she looked with her dark hair down, framing her face. ""You'll need to learn this before the sun goes down and we lose the light—so, listen carefully."" Peeta listened diligently to Katniss' instructions, his hand weaving through her soft hair, and he imagined one day braiding his daughter's sunshine locks as the sun went down in front of them. It had been a long week for her. Katniss was grateful to have the next few days off. She was in desperate need of sleep. She looked into the nursery and her eyes suddenly zeroed in on the empty crib where Joy once lay—something inside her ached at the thought that the little girl would never remember her. ""Nurse Everdeen?"" She looked up from the chart she was completing to see Haymitch in front of her. He had come back right on time to meet Joy before she went home. She could've sworn that there were tears in his eyes as he held the tiny golden-haired girl. Joy had that effect on everyone. ""You okay?"" he asked carefully. Katniss was sure that Johanna had spoken to him about Peeta. ""I'm perfect,"" she replied as she closed the chart. Katniss met his eyes and smiled. ""Ready to take a break, that's all."" ""I was wondering if you could do me a favor,"" Haymitch suddenly said. He placed a folded yellow blanket in front of her. ""Madge found this in the NICU nursery—it needs to be returned to the owner."" ""Why don't you just mail it?"" she asked. ""It's on your way to the house,"" he told her. ""It will be a quick drop off."" ""Haymitch— "" Katniss took the blanket from him. ""Why are you so insistent?"" She unfolded it and stopped at the embroidered name in the corner: Joy . Her friend slid a piece of paper across the desk to her. ""Their address."" Haymitch met her eyes. ""If you don't tell—I won't."" ""Katniss?"" Peeta stepped out onto the front porch where she stood. ""What are you doing here?"" Katniss held out the blanket to him, her cheeks flaming as he took it from her. ""You left this in the NICU—and I know how much Joy liked sleeping in it. She loved being bundled in this."" She met his eyes in the evening light. ""How is she?"" He grinned. ""She's perfect. And I'm tired—but I'm happy."" ""That's great,"" she said to him. ""I knew you were going to do just fine."" They went silent. ""I should go,"" Katniss told him abruptly. ""It was nice seeing you, Peeta."" She turned, stepping off his porch, and began the walk to her car. ""Hey, Katniss!"" She turned to see Peeta in front of her, his eyes—Joy's eyes—glowing under the light of the moon. ""I know you said that we couldn't be friends in the hospital—but, we're not at the hospital anymore."" He looked at her hopefully. ""Do you think we could be friends now?"" Katniss felt the grin grow on her face and she nodded. ""I think we could do that."" He beamed at her. ""Did you want to come in for a cup of coffee? We'll have a good half-hour before Joy wakes up."" ""Sure—as long as you let me tuck her in."" One Year Later "" Goodnight stars Goodnight air Goodnight noises everywhere…"" Peeta stopped in the doorway, watching as Katniss and Joy sat with their backs to him on the soft cream carpet of his daughter's nursery. Joy touched the pages of the book open in front of her and Katniss. He watched as Katniss placed a kiss on top of Joy's short, golden hair. ""I can't believe you're one,"" Katniss said to his daughter. ""You've grown up so fast, sweetheart."" Joy gurgled happily and he watched his daughter's hand reach for her dark braid—she loved playing with Katniss' hair. ""I love you, Joy. Do you love me?"" Joy turned and simply patted her face, her pink lips widening in a toothy smile. ""Good enough for me,"" Katniss said with a grin. Sweet blue eyes looked up at her. ""Mama?"" The melodious call made his heart jump. Her voice was so light and full of innocence—so much like his late wife's, who he missed every day. But that pain lessened as he watched his daughter grow in front of him. Peeta never really lost Joy; he saw her in their daughter. He saw pieces of himself in her, too. And, he even saw bits of the woman sitting with his daughter. The woman who loved Joy like her own—and the woman who had slowly woven her way into his heart. ""Oh no, sweetheart— "" He heard Katniss say. He could hear the heartbreak in her voice. ""I'm not—"" ""No— "" Peeta suddenly entered the room and sat next to her. Lifting Katniss' chin with his finger, he kissed her softly and looked into her eyes. ""Joy can call you Mama—if you want her to."" She stared up at him for a moment, her mouth lifting into a blissful smile. ""Yes."" Their lips met once more and when they pulled away, both of their faces were wet with tears. Katniss cleared her choked throat before lifting their daughter onto her lap. ""Yes, Joy. I'm your Mama.""

Nothing compared to the sight before him, thick chocolate hair that fell against her soft shoulders and curves that were emphasized perfectly by the tightly woven black corset she wore under the matching silk robe. ""Hey,"" he greeted back. ""How are you?"" ""You didn't pay fifty thousand dollars to talk to me,"" Katniss said as she walked towards him. ""No one talks to me."" ""I'm here to talk to you,"" Peeta replied easily as she led him to a plush chair in the middle of the room. As she slid off the robe, he could see that the cups of the corset barely held her breasts in. ""Haymitch is looking for you."" Katniss straddled him and he tried not to focus on her forceful grind—or the heat coming from in-between the apex of her thighs. ""Listen to me,"" she whispered against his ear. ""We can't talk here—they're everywhere."" The warmth of her breath against his ear made him twitch. ""Then where and when?"" Her hands reached behind his neck so that she could hold on to him as she danced. Katniss smiled softly and for a moment he saw the girl he knew. Peeta pushed his pelvis against hers and he was surprised when she let out a quiet groan. She cocked an eyebrow at him and his hands went to her hips as he brushed his now hard length against the barely there thong she wore. ""Tell me,"" he urged as he gripped her hips roughly. ""In the back—ten minutes!"" Katniss replied and her eyes closed as she pushed against him. When she opened them again, Peeta could see them clouded over with lust as she gasped for breath. ""You play a wicked game."" ""You started it,"" he countered. ""Is this what they come for?"" ""They pay because I know how to make them feel good,"" Katniss told him as she moved against him. ""I bring it out of them."" ""What?"" His hand traveled in-between her thighs without hesitation. The slick heat of his fingers in her reminded him of the three minutes he had asked for before he left her alone. ""Power, lust, fear, whatever makes them feel like they can run the world."" ""And what about you?"" He pushed in deeper and his thumb found her clit. Peeta's lips found her neck and his mouth tasted the skin he dreamt about for years. ""What makes you come?"" She still tasted the same. ""I have my memories,"" she said softly into his neck. Peeta felt her clamp down against his fingers and the rush of heat against his hand. ""Good girl, let it out,"" he whispered against her ear as she hissed her orgasm into his. ""I'll see you outside. I'm going to call Haymitch and let him know you're in."" Gently, Peeta let his fingers slide out of her as he helped her stand up. Peeta's fingers quickly went to his mouth so that he could taste her. It was as sweet as he imagined. His eyes traveled to the Mockingjay pin that he had given Madge to give to her. It sat nicely in-between the dip of the sweetheart line of the corset. Katniss met his eyes and grinned. ""Damn you, Peeta Mellark."" ""I did it, Eff,"" Haymitch said as he placed the bouquet of sunflowers on top of her tombstone. ""You always thought I was a lazy bastard but I'm going to save our home. And I know you never thought I cared for the little ones, but I did. Every single one of them—but I wish I could've done better for you."" His eyes watered thinking of her last smile—so gentle and serene. ""She never thought you were lazy."" Haymitch turned to see Johanna walking towards him along with Gale. They both carried bouquets of flowers which they placed in front of her stone. ""Effie just knew how to push your buttons,"" Gale said as he reached into the bag he carried on his shoulder and pulled out a bottle of champagne. ""She knew how to make you do things without you knowing it. She was the real mastermind."" ""I guess I wasn't the only one who remembered."" Finnick joined them with a jovial smile. He took out the mahogany earring and placed it on top of the tombstone. ""Hey, Effie—sorry for taking your earring. I just wanted something to remember my Mom by."" Haymitch put an arm around him. ""Glad you came."" He nodded at Johanna and Gale. ""All of you."" ""Sorry, I'm late."" Annie arrived breathlessly and hugged him. ""Had to run an errand."" She placed a box in his hand and he hesitated before opening it. The ring still looked new to him despite the many scratches it held. Each scratch held a memory of her and their years together. ""What did we miss?"" The group turned to find Peeta and Katniss walking towards them. Their hands were entwined tightly and Haymitch grinned—he knew Peeta would bring her back. ""Hey, Mockingjay,"" Finnick teased, though his smile fell slightly seeing Annie staring at him disapprovingly. ""None of that,"" Peeta said to him. ""She's just Katniss to us—none of that Mockingjay shit."" ""Looks like someone grew some balls,"" Johanna remarked with a smirk. ""Can we just toast already?"" Gale stomped his foot and then looked down at the tombstone he was standing on. ""Sorry—uh, Mr. Jones."" Annie handed out the cups and Gale poured. When they were topped off, Haymitch looked around at the group. At their children. ""It's going to be a big, big, big day,"" he started, quoting his late wife. ""And we've got a lot of work to do, but we're going to do it. For Effie."" They toasted in agreement and Haymitch gulped it down quickly before meeting their eyes again. ""Let the games begin.""

The sharp pain to my head comes quickly and as I hit the ground, I hear a loud snap through my body. Then, it all goes black. Rue is dead. So is her partner, Thresh—and now the last of the Careers, Cato. Mutts chased us to the Cornucopia. Horrible mutts with the eyes of our fellow Tributes. The thought shakes my insides. Especially the thought of the one with Rue's deep brown eyes. We had befriended the young girl during my supposed alliance with the Careers. Prim and I had planned it all along. The best way to kill them off was to start from the inside. We didn't expect the pretty little girl from District 11 to keep such close eyes on us, and to help Prim cut down the Tracker Jacker hive that took down Glimmer, the District 1 female Tribute. I had already been running out to our meeting place by the time the hive hit the ground. We spent two days with Rue, telling her about our life in District 12—of Gale, of Katniss, and how we were the Kings and Queens of the forest. On the last day, when I had destroyed the Careers' supplies and Prim had stabbed Clove from District 2 during a fight, we made Rue our very own Princess. Marvel, Glimmer's counterpart, had found the little girl, sending a spear through her stomach as she waited in our meeting spot. I had arrived too late but I sent an arrow to his chest. It is still the only kill that I feel good about. Prim had lost it, screaming into the air as she cradled Rue in her arms. I still see her blood-stained hands when I close my eyes. Prim's creamy skin had never been tainted. She had always been the neat one. Katniss had always been the one who enjoyed running through the mud with me. ""We have to clean her up before they take her,"" I whispered in her ear. ""Give her some dignity. Let her District know that she didn't die in vain."" Nodding frantically, Prim wiped her tears away as she gently laid Rue down in the grass. Together, we fixed her hair and zipped up her jacket so her wound was unseen. I made sure that her shoes were properly tied. When Prim disappeared, I gathered wildflowers for Rue to hold. Placing them in her small hands, I leaned down to kiss her forehead. ""Watch over us, Princess."" Prim is suddenly next to me, a small daisy chain crown in her hands. Carefully, she placed it on Rue's head and together, we stand up to embrace each other. ""I'm so tired, Peeta…"" Prim's sobs shake me to the core. ""No."" I take her face in my hands. ""Remember. Look to the West."" ""R-R-Right,"" she agreed shakily. ""And, we're the only ones left except for Cato and Thresh."" We left then, but not before holding up the District 12 sign, knowing that Rue's family could see us. Now, as I help Prim down from the Cornucopia, I look around and wait for the announcement to declare us winners of the 74th Hunger Games. But, instead— "" Attention, remaining Tributes—the previous rule…has been revoked. There can only be one Victor. Good luck and may the odds be ever in your favor."" Prim and I look to one another. I almost want to laugh at the absurdity and cruelty of it all. I take Prim's hand and placed within it the dagger that she used to kill Clove. ""Just like we practiced,"" I tell her as I put the knife to my carotid artery. ""We knew that this might happen."" Prim nods, her eyes intent. I know she doesn't want to, but we have a plan. I'm sticking to it. ""It doesn't have to be this way."" ""Yes, it does,"" I assure her. ""It's okay."" I breathe deeply and feel the blade against my skin. ""Always—remember?"" ""I remember,"" she says in a soft voice. ""Close your eyes, Peeta."" Closing my eyes, I feel a peaceful calm come over me and embrace the thought that I'll be somewhere watching over her. Maybe one day, she'll even name her son after me. Death doesn't come, however. Instead of blood filling my throat, I taste warm salted tears against my lips and I open my eyes panicked to see that Prim has dropped the dagger at my feet. Pulling away quickly, Prim stares at me, a blue smile on her pink lips. ""I've never been kissed before."" She looks up at the fake arena sky. ""I'm sorry!"" Then that word again—it comes out in single breath. "" Makidada… "" Her hand reaches into the pocket of her jacket and she pulls out a handful of dark, round berries. Her eyes meet mine and Prim gives me a tear-filled smile. ""Peeta…"" I rush towards her. ""PRIM, NO—"" But, she swallows the berries in one gulp and the cannon sounds as Prim falls to the ground. This wasn't part of the plan. We had a plan. I'm reaching for her, pressing her mouth to mine, and trying to breathe life back to her lifeless body. Or, maybe I'm trying to take the little bit of nightlock that might be left against her lips… All I know is that as Claudius Templesmith announces my name and declares that I am now the Victor of the 74th Hunger Games, I am clinging onto the body of one of my best friends before Peacekeepers pull me away to sedate me. Since I'm sure you're curious, the word 'Makidada' roughly translates to 'little sister' in Swahili. We'll learn about that in a later part of the story.

We took the train out to the next District where we could start over. Peeta got a job with a construction company where he was paid under the table. Eventually, I started working on the ledger for the company, putting my advanced math skills to use. Haymitch Abernathy, our manager, doesn't ask any questions. Even when he found out that we have no sort of identification or social security numbers. He did, however, find us someone who could give us identities—for a hefty price. ""Mellark,"" Peeta tells me with a smile. ""I wrote in that my name is Mellark."" ""You always did like their cakes,"" I respond as we sit in our small living room. ""I didn't know what to put for my last name."" ""Put 'Mellark',"" he states, his eyes suddenly bashful. ""I mean…never mind."" I climb onto his lap and wrap my arms around his neck. ""I was wondering when we would make it official."" Kissing him gently, I give him a bright smile. ""This was a very intimate wedding."" A week later on our kitchen table, I find an open jewelry box with a thin gold band and a cake from Mellark Bakery that says, ' Happy Wedding Day '. ""I told the guy at the front counter that we eloped a week ago and you always loved their cakes,"" Peeta tells me with a grin. ""He suggested that we feed one another just like they do at actual weddings and then save a piece in the freezer so we can eat it on our anniversary next year."" Excitedly, I sit on his lap as he slips the ring on my finger. With the disposable fork that the bakery gave us, I scoop a piece and feed him our first bite of non-medicated cake. Yes, we have good times. But, we also have bad moments. There are times when I wake up from my dreams screaming in terror. Sometimes, it is Peeta who wakes up in a feverish sleep, begging for Cray to leave him be. In-between sleep and dreams, I see blood on my hands and I know that every now and again, my husband will awaken seeing Cray's slit throat and open eyes. When I am pregnant with our first child, I worry constantly that he or she will find out about our past. I begin to think of plans for what would happen if our child found out. I couldn't explain to Peeta why I put a bed in the attic of the new house that we purchased just six months after Lila was born. After that, I began to write it all down. If I didn't, I would lose it. Occasionally, Peeta will add things into my journal, writing or drawing pictures of the past. We slowly grow together. When Lila is three, Peeta and I take her to the local mall for her first pair of shoes for preschool. I am pregnant with our second child, a boy, who is due on Father's Day. ""Mommy, looky!"" Lila's blue eyes gaze proudly at her new sneakers. I smile indulgently at her enthusiasm. ""Those are beautiful, sweetheart!"" Every day, Lila fills our lives with the sunshine we were deprived of in our attic home. I watch her take off in a run across the store, her two dark braids swinging. Peeta follows our daughter, catching her easily in his strong arms and blowing raspberries into her chubby cheeks. He meets my gaze and winks, easily making my cheeks grow warm. Even now, the fire has not tempered between us. ""Your daughter is adorable,"" one of the sales clerks remarks. Her blonde hair is neatly plaited in a braid and her blue eyes are bright, a similar shade as Lila's. ""How old is she?"" ""Three,"" I respond with a smile. ""Lila is also very spunky for her age."" ""Lila?"" The girl tilts her head at me. ""That's my mom's name!"" A sudden chill rushes through me and I quickly look at the girl's nametag: Prim . ""Are you okay?"" Peeta comes rushing to my side. ""You went pale."" I turn to give him a smile. ""I must be tired. Your son is giving me trouble."" ""Taking after his sister already,"" my husband responds. Prim retrieves the shoebox on the floor. ""I can ring you up for the shoes, Mrs…?"" ""Mellark,"" I tell her in a hasty voice. ""Mrs. Mellark."" Only when we reach our car do I tell Peeta in-between sobs that we have just come face to face with the sister that I couldn't remember. December arrives. Lila and Peeta decorate the Christmas tree as I nurse our six-month-old son, Owen, who is named after his godfather. My husband has been working for Mellark Bakery as a driver since Lila was two and has recently started training to become a pastry chef. Owen is the son of the infamous Mr. Mellark who started the successful chain of bakeries. He is two years younger than Peeta and has a similar crooked smile to my husband. Sometimes I wonder if they're related. There's a knock on the door and I stand up after fixing my top. We're expecting Haymitch, Lila's godfather, for dinner and to help untangle the Christmas lights. I am surprised when I find Prim at my doorstep. Her eyes briefly go to Owen before meeting mine; they share a similar shade of blond. ""I remember you,"" she suddenly says in a choked voice. ""I was three and Mom was looking for the shoes for my first day of preschool—just like you were with Lila. When she turned around, you were gone."" A hand goes to my shoulder and I turn to see Peeta behind me, Lila in his arms. Whatever I decide, we are in this together. After a moment, I make my decision and widen the door for Prim.

I want to savor the moment. Most of all, I want to savor her. Her nipples are sharp from the cold and leaning down I suck one, caressing the peak with the tip of my tongue. ""Fuck!"" Katniss cradles my head as I flick her nipple up and down in my mouth. There's something intensely sexy in the movement of my mouth on her tits—that feeling of a hard duct in my mouth. ""I'm going to come if you keeping doing that."" ""You're that wet?"" My free hand travels to the cleft between her legs, the heat emanating from her quim making me twist in hunger.

The essence of Katniss. ""You taste delicious."" She doesn't respond, her body undulating in the spiky sensations of hot and cold intermingling. It is not even a second before I make another grab for a rapidly-melting popsicle and get on my knees in front of her. Katniss brings her own knees up, her feet on each of my sides on the couch. Our eyes remain on one another, never breaking—even when I circle the cube along her stiff clit and then along her slick lips. Leaning down, I breathe her in—succulent, rich, and enticing. My lips go to her slit…sucking…tasting…relishing the taste of lemonade and Katniss. I am punch-drunk and inebriated, just barely aware of the nearly-painful grasp of Katniss' fingers in my hair as she grinds against my face. ""Ohh…uhh…"" The sounds coming out of her mouth urge me on until I'm in rapture, my tongue plunging into her quivering canal. ""Peeta…ohh…fuck!"" She tightens around my tongue and I suck, drinking her up eagerly. There isn't any time to recover as Katniss pushes off and onto the cot on the floor. She is frantic, her eyes crazed as she climbs onto me, and plunges onto my swollen cock in a matter of seconds. Her cunt swallows my length up eagerly. ""Oh—fuck!"" I'm barely conscious, dazed by the sensation of her surrounding me, hugging every nerve, causing spikes of pleasure to surge through my body. My hands move to her waist, gripping her harshly so that I can meet her thrusts. ""Katniss…please."" Katniss meets my eyes, her mouth in a musing, breathless smile. Her breasts bounce with every harsh jab of my dick and my hands go to her lemonade-sticky nipples, letting my thumbs graze along them. A warbled moan builds at the base of my throat as I feel the beginning of her second climax. ""Peeta!"" Katniss arches, her body almost folding back, as she comes around me. Hot-white light invades my sockets and I'm blinded and flying high as I thickly coat her insides. When I come back to earth, I feel her face resting against my shoulder. ""Dearest,"" I whisper, pressing a tender kiss to her forehead. My eyes become heavy, sinking in exhausted slumber. But, not before I hear her whisper, ""I love you…always."" The next day is much calmer; the temperature going down in the still of the night. I wake up, reaching for Katniss atop our couch and find it empty. Sitting up, I begin to pull my clothes back on. The slight creaks along my body are apparent as I stand, our joining, age, and having slept on a cot having contributed to my body aches. There is no iota of regret. I hear humming outside the window and, gathering my blanket, I go join Katniss on the porch. She is walking along the floorboards once again, her hands on her stomach and a gentle smile on her lips. I lean against the doorway, taking her in, seeing the ethereal glow about her as she sings. "" Dearest, though you're the nearest to my heart Please don't ever…ummm yeah…ever say we'll part You scold, and you are so bold Yes together…ummm yeah…our love will grow old… "" ""Where did you hear that song?"" Katniss turns to me, her mouth lifting even higher at my appearance. She walks over to me, giving me a full kiss as her hand reaches to put mine on our child. He or she is wriggling under my palm and I'm breathless at the feeling of enchantment that this tiny little person gives me. I can't wait until we meet. ""Sometimes, Haymitch sings it to himself. After awhile, I memorized the words,"" she explains. ""Last night, you called me dearest—and the baby hasn't stopped moving since."" She is all lit up inside at the thought of the little one and I feel my eyes grow heavy with tears. All this time, my wife has feared being a mother and without realizing it, she has taken to singing to our baby—like she did with Prim so very long ago. I wrap the blanket in my hands around her before pulling its ends to bring her close. We are bundled together, protected from cold and from the world. Just us two, though not for long. ""Why are you so good to me?"" Katniss asks softly. ""Because I love you,"" I tell her plainly. She kisses me, instead of responding, tender and sweet, and always full of hope. There is bang of a screen door and we turn to see Haymitch coming out of his house, a little rumpled and bleary-eyed. He smirks at us. ""Hot night, wasn't it?"" Katniss, this time around, doesn't bother to leave. Instead, she replies with a cheeky smile, ""It was—but we found a way to cool off."" Haymitch lets out a barking laugh. ""Yeah, I heard."" With that, he walks back into his house to let us enjoy the cool morning. FIN. Song-""Dearest"" sung by Buddy Holly"

However when he awoke, there was a note: Our sessions are over. –Katniss Three Months Later… ""Congratulations Haymitch."" Peeta shook the man's hand. ""Six months sober."" ""I've got a long way to go,"" the man replied. ""I also have a lot of groveling to do. Effie really is a saint."" ""She loves you,"" he responded. ""As long as you put in the work like she does, you'll both do fine. I'll have Delly give you some recommendations for marriage counselors along with your release letter."" Together, the two men went to the waiting room where Peeta gave Delly the final instructions for Haymitch. ""Peeta."" Delly handed him a piece of paper. ""Urgent message for you."" Opening the paper, Peeta skimmed the information before looking to his secretary. ""Cancel the rest of my day,"" he told her before walking out the door. Peeta nervously held the small bouquet of dandelions in his hand. Surprisingly, the florist close to his office had what he needed and had even wrapped the delicate bunch in a silk red ribbon. Standing outside the door to the room, he hesitated for a moment. She had left the message asking for him yet Peeta didn't want to intrude on her space. Also, there was the possibility that what Katniss had to say was not good. Their ending was not bad but it wasn't good either. In fact, Peeta was surprised by the amount of pain he felt in her absence. The door opened and an older woman in light blue scrubs stepped out, giving him a smile when she spotted him. ""You must be her young man,"" the nurse said. ""I think they've both stayed up for your visit."" She held the door open for him. ""Go on in."" Tentatively Peeta entered, walking against the thin barrier curtain. Peeking inside, he took in the sight in awe. Sitting up in the hospital bed was Katniss and in her arms was the small swaddled bundle that was her child. Sunlight streamed in through the half-closed blinds, beaming onto the mother and child. They were beautiful. ""Don't be a stranger."" Katniss looked up at him with a shy smile. She looked exhausted, her hair akimbo and dark circles under her eyes. However, she looked happier than he had ever seen her. ""Come meet my son."" He walked over to the head of the hospital bed. ""Long time no see."" She met his eyes. ""Did you miss me?"" ""Yes,"" Peeta told her, his gaze never leaving hers except to gaze tenderly at her little boy. Katniss' looks were clearly dominant as the newborn had her dark hair and olive skin. ""I missed you both."" ""Come sit next to me,"" she demanded and Peeta lowered the bed rail so he could move onto the side of the hospital bed. Her eyes went back to the sleeping baby. ""He's beautiful, isn't he?"" Her fingers caressed her son's cheek. ""From the moment he was in my arms, I knew nothing would ever make my life as full as being his mother."" ""He's gorgeous."" Peeta's finger went to the newborn's cheek. He had thick, raven hair similar to Katniss' and a pert little nose that was also from his mother. ""Nothing like his father, I'm sure."" ""I don't see any of ol' what's-his-face in this kid,"" Katniss informed him. ""He is all me."" She held the baby out to Peeta. ""Hold him."" Peeta instinctually moved away but Katniss took hold of his forearm. ""I'm not sure."" ""You don't scare him,"" she assured him. ""He recognizes you."" Carefully, Katniss placed her son in Peeta's arms. The blanketed baby squirmed for a moment before settling his head against Peeta. The feeling of the child on his chest made something inside soar; he knew that Katniss' son already had a place in his heart just like his mother. ""Congratulate me."" Katniss gave him a smile. ""Six months of non-sexual contact."" She looked to her son. ""After I posted bail and was sentenced, I found out about the baby. I knew I had to get help…for both of us. Then you saved us."" Peeta met her eyes. ""You saved yourself and your son."" Leaning forward, he pressed a kiss to her forehead, feeling her sigh against his skin. ""Congratulations."" Her eyes opened as he pulled away, her grey eyes shining. ""The reason I left was because I started to feel it come up again,"" she explained. ""We've worked on this,"" he told her as he rocked her child. ""You know exactly was to do in a situation like that. I'm confident in that."" Her eyes dashed downwards. ""It wasn't that kind of urge."" Peeta lifted her chin to look into her eyes. He realized that it was a different kind of urge. A different kind of hunger. It was the kind of want that spoke of holding hands and long conversations, of trust and affection and hopefully one day—love. ""I like you,"" he told her. She grinned through her tears. ""I like you back."" The baby yowled and instinctively Peeta continued his gentle motions before kissing the little one's cheek. ""What's his name?"" The baby gazed up at him, light blue eyes greeting him. Peeta felt that rush of love for the baby. Katniss and he were his just as Peeta was theirs—if they would have him one day. ""I don't know,"" Katniss responded, her head going to his shoulder. ""Maybe if you aren't busy later on, we can have a session on baby names."" He watch her eyes flutter close. ""I don't know if you realize but having a baby is exhausting."" Making sure that the baby was safe and sound asleep, Peeta kissed the top of her head. ""We'll figure it out together."" His eyes closed, the fatigue taking their little family over, and soon they slept. FIN. * Quote from The Velveteen Rabbit by Margery Williams"

He held her tight as the police officer walked over, speaking of a drunk driver, their friends attempt to avoid the man, and a car crash that she didn't want to think of. When it was over and the officer was gone, Gale sank to the ground and took her with him. Their house looked frozen in time, a relic of Katniss and Peeta Mellark. When Madge and Gale walked in, their eyes went to the unopened mail on the entryway table. In the kitchen, her eyes filled seeing Katniss' neat print on the bulletin board, including the small mark from last week saying, ' Vi learned to crawl! '. A little doodle next to the phone reduced Madge to a sobbing mess. Peeta must've been bored during a call, because on one of the notepads he had written over and over: I love Katniss, I love Viola… ""I have to find the number for CPS and we have to get Viola out of there,"" she started. ""Then, I'll have to call someone to close my studio for a bit and then…"" ""Stop."" Madge looked to where Gale stood in the kitchen doorway. ""Just sit for a moment because I still can't believe this is real."" He went to the dining room table. ""We were just sitting here with them two months ago!"" She went to him, her hand going to his shoulder. ""I feel like I have to do something, because if I don't then I just think about how we'll never see them again."" Madge pulled out a chair, tears prickling her eyes as she remembered Katniss' laugh. ""We lost our best friends…but Viola has lost her parents."" Gale wiped his eyes. ""Why did this happen?"" He looked so lost, so broken by it all. She let the sobs overtake her. ""I don't know…"" ""Cry it out, Madge,"" Gale told her hoarsely. ""Let me call CPS. You should rest."" ""I can't sleep,"" she replied. ""Not in this house."" ""Then go sit in the living room,"" he told her. ""I need you to go so I can cry and then get enough strength to get Viola back."" Their eyes met, his own bloodshot. ""Please Madge…I can't let you see me this way."" She nodded and stood up. ""I'll be in the living room."" Two Days Later… ""Madge, the lawyer is here."" She looked up from the changing table where Viola laid, her legs up in the air to see Gale watching the two. He gave her an exhausted smile, his unshaven face making him seem older and much more haggard. Gale looked like she felt. Diapering Viola, she lifted the little girl in her arms and then carried her over to Gale. ""Let me just wash my hands and I'll be right down."" ""We'll meet you down there,"" Gale responded before giving Viola a bright smile. ""And after we get all this crap out of the way, Uncle Gale is going to feed you whatever you want—we practically have the same appetites."" Madge gave them a wave before throwing out the dirty diaper then washing her hands in Viola's bathroom. Walking out into the hallway, her eyes went to a random picture hanging right between their friends' bedroom and Viola's nursery. It was of the four them on prom night. Peeta and Katniss were staring at one another as she and Gale smiled at the camera, his arm around her waist and her head on his shoulder. They all looked so young and carefree. Yes, Madge was mad at Gale then, but they shared one dance together and she had forgiven him enough to take that photo with her best friends—though she couldn't remember it. There had been some pre-party shots at Katniss' place. Oh, what a night that had been. Taking a deep breath, she descended downstairs and into the dining room where Gale sat with Viola across from their friends' lawyer, Plutarch Heavensbee. Joining them at the table, she nodded at the man before sitting down next to Gale and placing Viola in her lap. The little girl remained unaware, her hands toying with Madge's tangled mane. She hadn't even showered, feeling so stuck in herself. ""First off, I'd like to say how sorry I am that we're meeting under these circumstances,"" Plutarch said. ""Peeta and Katniss were very good friends of mine and they spoke so highly of you both."" Opening his portfolio, he looked it over before meeting their curious gazes. ""The house is paid off as they used the money inherited from their parents to foot the majority of the mortgage. However, if you choose to remain here, you are subject to the house tax."" ""What are you talking about?"" Gale asked. ""The next thing we'll discuss is Viola's inheritance,"" the lawyer continued. ""She has a trust fund which is to be given to her after she reaches the age of 25, though Viola may contest for an earlier release should she need it."" ""But, what about now?"" Madge inquired. ""Is there anything about whose going to take care of Viola?"" ""I thought that's why we were here."" The man produced a copy of a statement, handing Madge and Gale copies. ""They left Viola to you and your husband."" ""Husband?"" Madge looked to Gale, who was trying to pick his jaw up from the table. ""He's not my husband!"" ""The way they talked about you two, I thought you were,"" Plutarch said. Gale finished reading over the statement. ""Those two were fucking insane!"" ""I tried to convince them that it wasn't a good idea with your careers and such,"" the man said. ""But, it states clear as day that they reward full custody of their daughter, Viola Eustace Mellark, to Gale Hawthorne and Madge Undersee. As of today, you are both parents."" End of Part One.

Katniss blinked, surprised when she felt the trail of wetness on her cheeks. She didn't know where they would go but she felt that he had to know something, too. ""Will you grab my phone for me?"" she asked him. Peeta reached into her tote and took out her iPhone before handing it to her. ""If we really want to start again—to do this right—then you should know me, too,"" Katniss told him. ""I posted this picture on my Instagram about two months ago as a throwback."" She handed the phone back to him. ""I never ever thought you would see me like this."" Katniss watched as he examined the photo of her—12, in braces, and wearing a t-shirt with The Tributes' neon green logo on it. Behind her was a wall of P-Beatz posters that she had pinned and coveted with the careful care and longing of a young girl having her first crush. Peeta's finger traced over her adolescent face gently and she watched a smile grow on his handsome face. He met her eyes. ""You're adorable."" ""I had headgear too, you know,"" she told him with a grin. Peeta sat next to her, his arm going around her shoulders and pulling her close. ""Oh yeah?"" ""And, I didn't get boobs until I was 16,"" Katniss continued. ""I couldn't grow facial hair,"" Peeta said. ""I used to watch Cato shave when we were touring and I'd just be so jealous."" Katniss brushed her thumb along his chin. ""I like you better without facial hair."" ""The braces and headgear made your smile even prettier,"" he told her quietly. Her head went to his shoulder and she let out a small breath. ""When I was 12, my parents were getting divorced, just like yours,"" she said, her eyes closing and remembering that painful part of her past. ""You sang that song, 'You Are Mine' on TRL. It made me feel like I wasn't the only one going through something like that. I think I fell in love with you right then. You made me like someone like you could feel pain and regret, just like an ordinary person—like me."" ""Katniss, you were never ordinary,"" Peeta whispered into her ear. She took his hand, bringing her mouth to his knuckles, and her eyes closed at the sensation of his skin. ""Neither are you."" ""Can we start again?"" he asked. Katniss turned to him, seeing that same tenuous hope that she knew was in her gaze, before nodding. ""Yes."" One Year Later… They held hands the whole way home though Peeta's free arm held a bag of groceries. ""Annie is wondering if we can watch Maddie next Friday,"" Katniss told her boyfriend. ""What do you think?"" ""I'd say no, but that girl is so damn cute,"" he told her. ""And, I'm pretty sure that you already said yes."" She chucked. ""Yes, I did."" Peeta shook his head at her. ""I couldn't help it! Annie gave me that pout and told me that she and Finnick hadn't been…together…in months."" ""Far be it for me to deny my friends a chance to get intimate,"" he told her. ""I can't say no to you, either."" They made a turn leading into their apartment building and the sound of music wafted through the air where the courtyard was. ""I guess someone's having a party."" Katniss sighed. ""I hope it's not too noisy. I'm exhausted from doing inventory and we still have cleanup before your Dad gets here. We're trying to convince him that it was a good idea for us to move in together, remember?"" ""Of course, I remember."" Peeta stopped, turning to her. ""Why don't we check out this party? I'm sure they won't notice us."" She looked to him suspiciously. ""That's kind of weird, isn't it?"" ""Just a quick peek…"" Peeta pouted at her. ""…please?"" Katniss smiled at him. ""You have Maddie's pout."" Rounding the corner, they walked towards the courtyard and Katniss let out a yelp seeing what was in front of her. Her father was there with Lena and Rye, who waved at them joyfully. Beside them were Peeta's father and his brothers, Aidan and Grant. Then there was Prim along with Marvel—they were supposed to be on their honeymoon. At the end of the group were Finnick, Annie, and seven-month-old Maddie. Johanna was, not surprisingly, sitting on Cato's lap. They had met when Katniss moved into Peeta's apartment and spent two days in Johanna's apartment, 'purging' her presence. That's what Johanna called it when she called in sick, anyway. Katniss turned to Peeta. ""What is this?"" ""A reunion concert of sorts."" He led her further towards the courtyard and she saw that Gale and Thresh had also come. ""Come sit here."" She nodded in disbelief as everyone gathered around. ""Do you remember what happened here?"" Peeta asked her. ""Of course. This is where we first kissed,"" she responded with a roll of her eyes. ""It's also when I first realized that you were it for me,"" he told her. ""I want to ask you something—but first, I thought I'd sing the song that made you fall in love with me."" Katniss beamed. ""Really?"" Peeta stood up and the rest of the group gathered behind him. Cato clapped his shoulder as Gale began to strum the guitar to begin the first chords of 'You Are Mine'. ""Yes, I'm going to sing to you,"" Peeta told her. ""But after, you have to say yes."" Katniss nodded eagerly. ""I promise."" Peeta reached into his pocket and placed a velvet box in her open palm. ""Hold this."" He winked before stepping back to begin his song. FIN.

176,1,32,1-JLaLa-32.txt,hunger-games,JLaLa,"a bouquet of wildflowers-an apology for what he had done. Why was he sorry? Better yet, why was she crying? Year Three There was still no baby. Hazelle's wish for a grandchild had gone unfulfilled. It didn't help matters when Madge gave birth to a beautiful, golden-haired boy named Cole, who inherited her sweet smile and her husband's green eyes. The town looked at their beautiful baby then they turned to Katniss waiting in expectation for a little version of her or Gale. Her first time had left her jaded when it came to the concept of lovemaking. Gale had come home later that day to find her still in bed, her body aching from his intrusion. He went to her immediately, lifting and bringing her to the tub so that he could clean her up. He murmured his apologies in her ear over and over as she struggled to not show him her pain. However by the time the warm water hit her pelvis and she cried out, they were both in tears. Gale had started working in the mines at the beginning of their third year. They wanted to make improvements on their home so the extra cash helped. Katniss used her new bow in the mornings to hunt while he was gone. The feeling of the quiet forest helped calm her nerves. She wasn't so daisy-fresh anymore. There was something bitter growing inside her. Was this how it felt to grow up? Everything looked unclean, including herself. Katniss could barely look at herself anymore. She couldn't recognize the grey eyes staring back at her. Her husband had become very attentive, more affectionate even- but it seemed too late. Sure, she would smile when they were among their family and she would give him a kiss on the cheek here and there. However, when they were home and they lay in their bed—she no longer reached for him. Summer came and their home became a furnace. She couldn't sleep so she stayed up listening to Gale's steady breathing intermingling with the sound of crickets outside their window. One night, just as she was about to close her eyes, Katniss heard him shift to look over at her. Instinctively, she shut her eyes and waited for him to reach over for her. Instead, she heard him sit up slowly and her ears heard the sounds of him dressing quietly followed by his steady, quiet footsteps as he walked out of their bedroom. Both she and Gale were light steppers because they were hunters. They also shared the same keen sense of hearing. Katniss listened to him leave their house and she could hear his steps from their open window heading upwards. He was going over the fence and into the forest. Katniss ran to their closet and threw on the olive jacket that Gale had bought her two weeks ago. It was a replacement since she had outgrown her old one. She gave her old jacket to Prim, though it looked like her sister might outgrow it soon. Taking her boots, she slipped her feet into them and rushed out of their bedroom. Their sitting area and kitchen was dark except for the small sliver of light coming from the crescent moon outside. Opening the door, she walked out onto the porch and made her way around the perimeter of their house following their trail. She knew it by heart and found herself walking it easily even in the darkness. Her steps were light as she stepped under the broken wired fence. Katniss listened for his footsteps as she roamed further into the woods. It always seemed like time stopped outside the border. Katniss didn't know how long she had been walking when she heard a sound to her left. Quietly, she walked as she tried to steady her breathing—if it was an animal; there was a chance of her getting attacked. Weaving her way through the trees, she stopped when she heard a branch crack under someone's foot. It was Gale. He was usually so careful to not step on branches because the sound would scare off prey. However, her husband was too distracted to notice that he had made a fatal hunting mistake. He was pressed against the trunk of a tree, his hands grasping the short golden hair of the man he was kissing. The air was knocked out of her and she stepped back, as quietly as she could, trying to stop herself from gasping for breath. Her legs were quaking under her and she suddenly turned to run, not caring if anyone heard her. The cold rush of air hit her face and Katniss picked up speed letting her strong legs pull her away from the image she had seen. He had betrayed her. Katniss cried out at the thought and she pumped her legs harder as she let the wind hit her wet face. She closed her eyes for a moment, trying to push everything out of her mind when she slammed into something. No, someone. Opening her eyes, she found her face pressed into a strong chest. Looking up, her grey eyes met the glowing blues of Peeta Mellark, the baker's youngest son. So this is kind of a new thing that I'm trying. I never really dabbled in the actual Panem universe but this idea came to me during one of my favorite shows and I just couldn't let it go. I started writing this around the middle of December and told myself that I wanted to finish the whole thing by the beginning of 2014. I made this my last goal for the year. So celebrate—because this fic is actually completed. Yay! I know that it's turning out slightly off kilter and it will continue to be this way.

""And I swear, I was yours from the moment I flicked your nose."" ""Cato…what is this?"" I slowly go on one knee. ""This is me trying to work on my resolution—to be a little braver."" I reach into my pocket and pull out the ring box for her to take. ""Marry me?"" She reaches for the box and opens it. ""Holy shit!"" I look up at her and in spite of the situation, I laugh. ""Is that all you have to say?"" She falls to her knees so that we're eye to eye. ""What do you want me to say?"" ""Yes."" I brush my lips against hers. ""Say yes, Primrose."" I only call her by her full name when I really want something and she knows that. I kiss the side of her mouth. ""Say yes ."" The last yes is whispered into her ear and I can feel her fall against me. ""Then yes,"" she whispers. ""Of course, it is a yes."" I pull her to me and stand us up. Prim is holding me tightly and I can feel the wetness of her tears against my cheek. ""Thank you for making one of the worst nights of my life into the best."" ""Thank God!"" A voice interrupts. ""I thought we were going to freeze to death waiting!"" The loud blare of noisemakers rings through the night air as Katniss and Peeta along with the rest of the Mellarks jump out of their hiding places. They had arrived a few minutes after I did and begged me to stay. Johanna and Gale stayed with the kids. ""We're engaged!"" Prim holds out her left hand, which now sports the engagement ring on her finger. ""We know! We've got it recorded on all of our phones!"" Peeta says after he kisses her cheek. ""I'm uploading it on YouTube now,"" Rye tells us. ""Don't you dare!"" Prim yells but reaches over and hugs him anyway. Katniss approaches me, a smile on her face. It's both happy and sad. ""Think of it this way, you're not losing a sister. You're just gaining…me."" I kiss her cheek. ""Are you sad?"" ""No, it's just that I still have a hard time not seeing her as fourteen year old."" She looks over at Prim who is showing Carrie her ring. She looks over and flashes me a smile. ""But she looks so fucking happy and that's all your doing."" ""Come on, everyone! It's time to have our New Year's toast!"" Mr. Mellark calls out, his arm around Prim. ""My daughter has just asked me to walk her down the aisle!"" He kisses the side of her head. Carrie hands me a plastic flute. ""It's apple cider so Katniss can drink, too. Congratulations."" She hugs me and joins her husband. ""I hope you and Katniss don't mind,"" Prim says to her brother and sister. ""Of course not, sweetheart,"" Katniss replies, her eyes wet. Prim goes to her. ""I'm just full of hormones."" ""Oh, Katniss."" Prim hugs her. ""You will be my matron of honor, right?"" Katniss nods and then begins to cry again. ""I can't wait for your speech."" ""And you'll be my best man,"" I tell Peeta. ""I promise that I won't get us kicked out of any clubs like last time."" Peeta nods with a happy smile. ""Of course."" ""Okay everyone! I'm freezing my balls off, so let's toast!"" Wheaton says. ""To our beautiful sister, Prim and her fiancé, Cato!"" ""To the New Year,"" Mr. Mellark adds. ""To the future,"" Peeta says. ""To family."" Katniss smiles and looks down at her small bump. ""To planning a wedding."" Carrie looks over at Prim. ""You won't regret having me as your coordinator."" ""To marriage."" Marvel puts an arm around Rye, and looks at me. ""Welcome to the circus."" ""To Cato finally putting a ring on it!"" Rye winks at me. ""We haven't chased him away, so he must be a keeper."" Prim walks over and wraps an arm around my waist. She looks up at me, her eyes sparkling brightly like the ring on her finger. ""To resolutions,"" she says. I kiss her softly. ""To you."" We toast. So this is a one-shot of gigantic proportions - but as everyone might remember, chapters from Two Wrongs were usually this long. Some notes as usual: Prim and Cato's apartment is in the Mission District around 16th Avenue, which is where a lot of the delicious taquerias are located. Also, there is some awesome vintage shopping, like Clothes Contact and Thrift Town, around there. Savor is a restaurant in Noe Valley which has a delicious brunch menu. They also have an adorable porch area. There is some great shopping around the area, too. It's a very family oriented neighborhood. El Farolito is a Taqueria in the Mission which I go to—a lot. The best part is that they're open really late so if you're hungry in the middle of the night, it is one place you can go to. Prim is now working at University of California San Francisco (UCSF) which is actually a teaching hospital. The Mount Zion Campus is where the Cancer Center is located. I actually worked there for a bit as an admin. Cato is still teaching at San Francisco State University. As you can probably guess, Katniss is having a little blond boy as written in ""Mockingjay"". ""The Adventures of Milo and Otis"" was a favorite movie of mine as a child. It's a really cute movie about a friendship between Milo, the cat and Otis, the dog. Dudley Moore narrates it. Jessa is Gale and Johanna's only child. She is named after my dear supermodel twin. Song: ""This is Your Night""- Amber Thanks for getting to the end of this. I hope you enjoyed it. It's always nice to revisit my favorite family. -JLaLa"

""Might want to keep it down. The kids are downstairs, you know,"" Peeta responded quickly. ""Are you kidding me?"" She looked to Katniss as a particular painful contraction happened. ""I swear that I'll kill him right now!"" Katniss looked frostily at her husband. She finally admitted their marital status to Johanna, just a few weeks ago. ""Not if I do first,"" Katniss assured her before looking to the man currently paling against the doorway. ""Please go downstairs and check on the kids. We'll talk later."" Peeta disappeared with a quick shut of the door. ""Is it over yet?"" Johanna asked miserably. ""I mean, how long has it been?"" ""A few hours, give or take,"" Mrs. Everdeen informed her. ""It's going to be one more big push and I think we're going to get the head out."" ""You hear that?"" Haymitch told her. ""One more, just one more."" ""Everything is going to change…"" Johanna looked over to him, tears of pain and exhaustion glistening on her face, as she bore down. ""I don't know how to do this! I have no patience and can barely stand kids. Except maybe Willow and Rye…Rowan, too. But, Annie says that he's getting into those weird teenage years. I don't think I can deal with a teenager."" ""Johanna."" His gaze remained on her. ""You're thinking too far ahead. Neither of us is going to know what happens until you push her out."" Haymitch took a slow breath. ""When she's here, we'll figure it out. We always do. We always will."" ""You said 'we',"" she croaked out. ""I did."" Haymitch nodded in agreement, giving her an encouraging smile ""Do you think that you're ready to get her out?"" ""Yes."" Katniss helped her sit up before she settled back against Haymitch's chest. Her friend joined Mrs. Everdeen at the edge of the bed. ""What does it look like down there?"" Katniss tilted her head in examination. ""Like a clam with dark hair."" ""That sounds horrendous,"" Johanna responded. Her head pressed against Haymitch's shoulder as she felt the next tide of pain rising. Closing her eyes, she concentrated on the solid thought of making the pain going away. And, it happened so quickly—the feeling of something sliding out before a shrill cry filled the room. ""She's here,"" Haymitch announced thickly. ""I'm afraid of opening my eyes."" ""Why?"" he asked. ""Because when I open them, everything will be different."" ""Just open them,"" Haymitch encouraged her. ""Nothing bad is going to happen, not while I'm here."" So Johanna did. Her eyes were as dark as night, her skin as rich and olive as her father's, and her hair was a thick ink. She was perfect. Katniss cooed at the baby before placing her in Johanna's arms. ""You made that."" ""I helped,"" Haymitch added indignantly. ""Yeah…yeah."" Katniss grinned at her former mentor. ""She definitely has your frown."" The baby's rose lips pursed at Johanna. ""So you're the one who's been kicking me,"" she said softly. ""If you weren't so cute and I wasn't tired as hell, I'd probably be pissed."" The rainy day had cleared, bits of sunshine filtering through the gauzy curtains and warming the room. ""I think you like her,"" Haymitch remarked, his eyes on the baby in her arms. Tentatively, his hand reached to touch the girl's round cheek and he laughed softly when a small smile rose, plumping her face even more. Johanna closed her eyes, exhaustion finally taking over her as she accepted the lull of slumber. ""I think I might love her."" ""She is small,"" Willow whispered so not to wake the baby in Haymitch's arms. ""You were once this small, sweetheart,"" Haymitch told her affectionately. ""She's depending on you to teach her the ways of District 12."" ""I'll do a good job,"" the little girl responded, her blue eyes solemn as she accepted her duty. ""I promise."" ""I'm real sorry about walking in on you,"" Peeta told Johanna from the foot of the bed. ""I feel sorrier for you,"" Johanna told him as Rye crawled over to her to look at the baby. ""You had a full-frontal view."" ""Well, that will teach him to enter rooms without thinking,"" Katniss said to her friend, sitting on Peeta's lap. ""My mom is talking to Rowan and Annie right now, telling them to come visit."" ""What's her name?"" Rye asked, his eyes on the baby as his small fingers moved over her dark hair in curiosity. Johanna turned to Haymitch. ""Any thoughts?"" ""Nope. I'm still reeling over the fact that she's currently snoring against me."" Willow looked to Johanna, her smile bright. ""The rain stopped when she came—like you said."" She went to Johanna, blue eyes looking very worldly. ""And, it was pretty! Daddy let us stand out on the porch to look at the rays through the clouds. Then, we could hear her crying."" It came to Johanna suddenly. ""Rae."" Haymitch's eyes met her and he nodded in understanding. ""Rae."" ""But, her last name will be Mason-Abernathy,"" she said. ""That's a little complicated for a kid, don't you think?"" Katniss stood up. ""I think this is our cue to leave."" Peeta joined her. ""Come on, little ones. Haymitch and Johanna are about to have their first fight in front of Rae."" Willow and Rye rushed over to their parents and the Mellarks left the room, closing the door behind them. ""Abernathy is fine,"" Johanna told him. ""Actually, Rae Abernathy sounds perfect."" Haymitch pressed a kiss to her forehead. ""Fight over."" ""Can I stay?"" He turned to her once more, grey eyes tired but full. ""I thought that was the plan."" Johanna rested back against the cool pillows. ""Okay."" Haymitch adjusted Rae's yellow bundling, his eyes hidden. ""Maybe you might think of adding Abernathy to your name…one day."" She took a solid breath before looking to Rae and then Haymitch. ""Okay."" FIN."
179,1,23,1-JLaLa-23.txt,hunger-games,JLaLa,"of Haymitch's laughter draws my attention back to him. ""Those two are very possessive."" He shuffles to move me off his lap. ""You should go and assure them that their big, bad mentor has not touched you."" Laughing, I lean down and press a kiss to his mouth. ""I don't belong to anyone. Especially not them."" It's the lie I tell myself every time I dream of them. On my third night in District 12, I wake up screaming. The nightmare is always the same: the room slowly filling with water until my screams are nothing but a rush of white bubbles in front of me. This particular dream features another dead Victor—Mags. She smiles gently at me before pressing a kiss to my forehead. ""Johanna…it's alright…"" The tender voice cuts through the night terror. My body is drenched in cold sweat and my throat hurts from the screams that no one heard in the water. ""I'm drowning…"" I open my eyes and find Katniss wiping my soaked forehead. ""Katniss, I drowned!"" ""I know,"" she replies, her grey eyes full of pain. ""Peeta told me about your time in the Capitol. The water…the electrocution…anyone would find that horrifying. Even someone as brave as you."" ""I'm so tired, Katniss."" Her eyes fill with tears at my words. There's a dip in the mattress behind me and Peeta's arm wraps against my front, right above my chest. ""Don't let them take you away from us,"" he whispers in my ear. His mouth ghosts along my neck, against my hair, and I stiffen in pleasure at the sensation. My eyes go to Katniss who is suddenly inches closer. If I lean any closer, I can almost taste her once more. ""You're soaked from your nightmare,"" Katniss says against my lips. Her hands are already unbuttoning the front of my nightgown. ""Let's get this off."" ""This is weird,"" I suddenly tell her and sit up. ""It's wrong."" ""You took care of us,"" Peeta interrupts as his large hand moves the thick strap of the gown off my shoulder. His mouth goes to my sweaty skin and I fall back against him. ""Let us take care of you."" Katniss pushes the skirt up before pulling the gown up over my head, leaving me naked before her and Peeta. My body hums in anticipation. I won't say no to either one of them at this point. ""Show me."" I lean back against Peeta once more. ""Show me how you're going to take care of me."" Katniss presses her forehead to mine, her lips brushing over mine and leaving me breathless. ""I've learned a lot after our time together."" She looks to Peeta. ""I told him how it felt to have my fingers inside you."" Katniss spreads my legs apart, the palms of her hands moving towards my soaked cunt. She finds my clit easily, pressing the pad of her thumb against it as her index and middle fingers sink inside me and my shoulders push into Peeta's heaving chest. ""I think it's better that he gets to see,"" Katniss says. ""I also told him something else."" My mouth is open in a silent cry. ""What?"" ""I told Peeta that you wanted to kiss him,"" she tells me. ""Because you had never been kissed the way that he kissed me."" I look over my shoulder and grin at the handsome golden-haired man. ""She made it sound really good."" Peeta laughs gruffly before his mouth moves along my lips till I'm hurting to have his lips pressed to mine. He does not disappoint. Peeta Mellark's kiss is all about control and precision, his mouth making sure to move across every piece of skin around my lips before finally kissing me. His tongue probes against my slightly open lips to allow him to brush his tongue to mine. ""You helped us find our way back to each other,"" he tells me in-between kisses. ""You were our guidepost."" My eyes roll back when I feel the touch of a tongue to the inner lips of my slick sheath. I moan into Peeta's mouth, ripping my lips away just in time to see Katniss kneeling in-between my legs, her large dark eyes looking up at my hard nipples and blushing body. Peeta smiles at my noiseless pant. ""I imagined the kisses between you two, over and over. This kiss was a particular one that I actually wanted to see."" Katniss' nose brushes against my clit and my cry is covered by Peeta's eager kiss. That night was the first night in a long time where I was not plagued by nightmares. By dawn, we are all sated as Peeta finishes, coming inside me for the second time. There is no need to worry about a child. I have been sterile for long while, another painful Victor punishment. Snow wanted to make sure that I would never have a family. It is okay. I have them. As the sun rises, I rest my head against Katniss' abdomen, wrapped in a cool night shirt, as her hand plays with my hair. Her head lays on Peeta's shoulder as he presses gentle kisses along her temple. ""Johanna, we have to tell you something,"" Katniss suddenly says as the morning light bathes her skin in gold. I look up at her, beautiful and serene, in all her naked glory. The glow of her skin travels throughout her full breasts and hips. Peeta gazes at her in adoration, his arm around her protectively. I've seen this look long ago. It was the same look that my father gave my mother when she was pregnant with my baby brother. The memory doesn't slice through as harshly as it had in previous times. I sit up and turn to them, an excited grin growing on my mouth. ""We're having a baby."" Katniss nods in joyful affirmation ""We're having a baby."" The tears come suddenly, escaping out along with happy sobs as a long-forgotten feeling overtakes me. Hope. FIN."
180,4,14,4-Straight-thru-the-Heart-Fics-14.txt,twilight,StraightthrutheHeartFics,"he retained his composure. ""What do you mean."" ""That's why a treaty was required when they decided to live here, because we are protectors and they are the ones we protect against. I can't reveal more, but I can say that the Cullens themselves are good ones. Most of their kind is bad, but their family is not. Every one of them does the opposite of what their evil counterparts do. If Bella had to become one of them, I'm glad it's with Edward. The Cullens are worthy of a truce between natural enemies, Charlie. Bella's going to be okay. I know she will."" ""Thank you, Sue. This is…a lot to take. Enemies and supernatural stuff. But she seems to be happy, and it helps that you vouch for the Cullens."" Sue shrugged and gave him a look that said 'the Cullens aren't the point.' Sue stepped closer to Charlie, and before he knew it, she'd wrapped her arms around him and was squeezing him tight to her. It was not at all unpleasant. ""I know it's hard to accept. When Seth and Leah turned, they were powerful and magical and I was still just an ordinary person. Now you're in the same boat."" She rested her forehead against his chest, hugging him tighter now. He wrapped his arms around her and held her to him, enjoying the feel of her embrace. ""I'm sorry I let you worry. I'm sorry I didn't tell you."" Her voice was muffled against his chest. ""It's okay. I understand."" He stroked her hair back from her face as she looked up at him. Their eyes connected and held for a few moments. Their lips met before Charlie realized what he was doing and he was slightly horrified that he was kissing his dead friend's wife, but he liked to think Harry would be happy. Sue's lips felt so good, so soft, it would be a waste if she never kissed anyone again. And who better than Charlie? He checked her eyes for resistance and, finding none, went in for another, deeper kiss. This one really made his head spin—the taste of her, the feel of her body moving closer to his, her arms winding around his neck, her nails scratching at his nape. It sent a buzzing sensation through his whole body that he hadn't felt in a long while. ""Is this wrong?"" she asked when they broke, her voice breathless. ""If it's wrong, I don't want to be right."" After a brief pause, Sue burst into laughter. Her shoulders shook with her mirth. ""You are so corny!"" Their laughter melted into warm smiles, and again they kissed, and kissed, and kissed some more. Charlie was starting to hope she'd stay for a while longer, but she pulled back with a shy smile. ""Well, I should be going."" ""You sure?"" ""I'll come back, just...not tonight."" ""Okay,"" Charlie said as she made her way to the door. He listened until her car drove away, then went upstairs to his bedroom, relishing the tension she'd built up in him and anticipating what he hoped was to come. CSCSCSCSCS ""Morning, Chief. Thought you might like some donuts with your coffee."" Sue placed a half dozen donuts on his desk. ""Wow, thanks."" He peered into the plastic window on the box. ""Ooo, chocolate glaze, my favorite. How did you know?"" ""I didn't. That's my favorite and I hoped you wouldn't want them."" Charlie chuckled. ""Well, I'd love it if you helped me eat them."" Sue took a seat while he got her a cup of coffee. When they were both settled, they dug into those donuts. As he ate, Charlie appraised the woman before him shoveling donuts into her mouth, oblivious to his attention, and she let out a delighted little moan after every few bites. It was part of what appealed to him about Sue. She was down to earth, didn't care about appearances (obviously, with the way she plowed through those donuts). He enjoyed her carefree attitude though, always had. She was also strong and driven. A widow too young, the mother of two supernatural people, a high-ranking council member of the tribe. And yet she held herself together, soldiered through the tough times and didn't let them beat her down. This woman understood the pressures of leadership just as he did, but she didn't let it rule her life. Instead, she embraced each moment, and lived to the fullest. That was what Charlie needed. He figured what the hell. He'd lived too long alone. His life needed rejuvenation, and who better to do that with than this beautiful woman who knew him so well. And those kisses they'd shared, they'd stoked a fire in him, and he knew she felt it too from the passionate way she kissed him back. It was a risk. She was his friend, and by going out on this limb, he might lose that friendship if she said no. But he was tired of playing it safe. He cleared his throat. ""Um, Sue?"" ""Yeah?"" she asked around a mouthful of chocolate fried dough. He scrubbed a hand over his stubble, knowing his nervousness showed, but he soldiered on anyway. ""Would you maybe want to go see a movie with me?"" She wiped her mouth with a napkin and smiled widely, revealing a small chocolate smudge on her front tooth. ""You are too cute."" He blushed and ducked his head. Looking back up at her, he found her gazing tenderly at him. ""So, is that a yes or a no?"" ""Sure, Charlie. I'd like that.""

I don't like the sound of where this is going. I take my seat as she serves me. The chicken smells delicious. We are halfway through dinner when she drops the bombshell. ""The divorce was finalized today."" For a moment, I am gobsmacked before she hits me with a second surprise, this one as bad as the first one was good. ""I'm moving out, Edward."" Her eyes are downcast, and she refuses to raise her head and meet my shocked gaze. ""Why?"" What happened? Why is she talking about going all of a sudden? ""Why? Because it's the right thing to do. I should have moved out ages ago."" She still can't meet my eyes. ""Bullshit."" My voice is raised. I don't care. ""I have taken undue advantage of your generosity. I've hampered your life. You can't put your life on hold because of me,"" she whispers. ""Who fed you this crap?"" My anger is evident in my words. ""Edward—"" ""Answer me, Bella,"" I demand. Her silence is my answer. Fuck people. Fuck their big mouths. And fuck my father's temporary secretary, Jessica, for being a bitch. I know who plants the seeds of self-doubt with such precision. ""Fuck this,"" I mutter as I leave my chair to move toward hers. Her eyes are pools of confusion as I pull her into my arms and put my lips on hers. Perfection. It feels as if I've died from too much happiness. She tastes of wine and Bella, a unique taste that I have never tasted in all my life. Her lips are hesitant, but they accept mine as I slowly court them with all the love I feel for this woman in my arms. I still feel as if I'm dreaming. Having her finally in my arms after loving her for so long feels as if gods made her for me. My tongue nudges her lips, and she opens for me. I drink her sweetness from the chalice that is Bella, and I feel as though I'm the luckiest man alive. Tentatively, her tongue slides with mine. This woman could make me come with just a kiss. ""Does this feel like you're hampering my life, Bella?"" I whisper as I pull her to me, making her feel my erection. A blush taints her cheeks. ""Feel what you do to me by just existing. Does this feel like charity to you, Bella?"" She buries her head in my chest but doesn't reply. ""Let people talk, sweetheart. That's what they do,"" I murmur. After a moment, she lifts her head and looks into my eyes. I am a goner. This woman has me wrapped around her pinkie, and she doesn't even know it. That is the last thought that crosses my mind before I start kissing her again. We end up in my bedroom. And we are ravenous. Her hunger for me matches my hunger for her. We are a single being of crashing lips, wandering hands, and entwined limbs. Somewhere along the way to my bed, we have lost our clothes. She sits at the corner of the bed, head bowed. She is perfect. My Bella. She tries to hide herself, but I kiss her insecurities away. I kneel in front of her, my eyes never leaving her skin. Her breasts are magnificent, her nipples hard points of arousal. I close my mouth over one while my hand shapes the other. ""Edward,"" she moans, her head thrown back, eyes closed in ecstasy. I flick my tongue over her stiff bud. ""What do you want, Bella?"" I ask as I give the same attention to the other neglected one. ""You,"" she pants. ""Only you."" I push her on my bed and follow. She is a vision, this woman in my bed. Her alabaster skin is glistening with sweat, her eyes are needy, and her mouth is swollen from my kisses. She is my seduction, my passion. I move down to start from her feet and work my way up to her mouth. It's gonna be a long night. I pepper kisses on the arch of her foot while my hand slowly inches toward her inner thighs. What can I say? I'm a greedy bastard. ""How do you want me, Bella?"" I ask while I find hidden mysteries of her calf through my skilled lips. She's making those needy sounds in her throat, ones that urge me to abandon the foreplay and dive straight for the treasure. ""Answer me, Bella,"" I plead as I kiss the backs of her knees. My hands have traced my name on her inner thigh for the past several moments. That is only why they have not yet parted the folds of Bella's slick pussy. I am between her legs, slowly inching toward my goal when her needy whimper reaches my ears. ""I want you in any way I can get you, Edward."" I raise my head to see her propped on the pillows. Her eyes bore into mine, and I see myself mirrored in those orbs that have shed far more tears than anyone I know. I see love in them. ""That's quite handy because you are going to have me, sweetheart."" I smirk as I dip my head, and my lips touch her pussy. I had always wondered in the back of my mind, when I'd been fucking all those women, what she would taste like. Now I have my answer. She tastes like my eternity, my soul mate, my happily ever after.

His growl pulls me back into the present. I realize that my mission is complete, and I should hop off of this stranger, but I don't want to. He makes me feel so good. His kiss chases away the darkness, filling me with a heat of passion and so much more. It's indescribable, and it's scary. I pull away from him, opening my eyes to get a better look. His eyes are slowly blinking open just as there is a tap on my shoulder. ""You don't have to rub it in. We got it,"" James says from behind me. The stranger looks up at James and frowns, his eyes then meet mine and they widen. ""It's you,"" he says. His words cause a memory from earlier in the day to rush back to me. ""The Bennie and the Jets girl."" ""You two know each other?"" Victoria asks, moving around James to stand beside us. I hop off of the stranger's lap and fold my arms across my chest, uttering the word ""no"" as he says ""yes."" I do remember him, but I don't want to have to redo this challenge with a hundred more people. I'm exhausted. ""I sang to you this morning,"" he says as he stands and walks toward me. ""This doesn't count, Bella,"" Victoria says, and Edward turns to her, his brows drawn together. ""Bella,"" he says, turning his attention back to me. He smiles that same smile from this morning, and my heart thunders in my chest. ""That's your name?"" I nod and his smile brightens. ""Are you two done having goo-goo eyes for each other? Can Bella get back to her job?"" Victoria rolls her eyes and stomps away, pulling James by the arm. I follow, turning my attention from the handsome stranger. ""Job?"" he follows behind us causing Victoria to look back and huff. ""Your job is to kiss random boys on the beach?"" ""No, this isn't a job. It's a social experiment, and you're messing it up for me,"" I mumble, shooting him side glances. He stops walking and reaches for my arm, halting my steps. ""Can I have your number?"" With obvious displeasure, I back away from his advance out of fear. ""I don't do that. Well, I try not to anyway."" He grins and takes out his phone. ""Take a chance on me."" ""I can't. I got-ta go."" I wave as I back away, but he reaches for me again. ""Come on, I sang for you. I don't do that for just anyone."" His smile widens causing a smile of my own to spread across my face. Looking away, trying to hide the fact that his smile affects me, I reply in a low voice, ""I doubt that. Boys with your face probably do that all the time."" He reaches out and taps my hand with his phone. I look up in time to see him licking his lips. ""You're wrong about me."" ""It's a possibility, but better safe than sorry, right?"" I ask with outstretched arms as I take another steady step away from him. He comes forward matching my step. ""You don't seem like the same carefree girl I sang with earlier. She would give me her number."" ""Bella!"" Victoria calls loudly in a very rude and demanding way. With the roll of my eyes, I turn to face her. ""One second."" I turn back to the boy who is quite determined to have my number. ""Look, I'll give it to you if you promise to go away."" ""Deal,"" he replies, looking at me expectantly with his phone in his hands. I rattle off my number one by one and watch as he grins from ear to ear in victory. Then all of a sudden, his eyebrows rise practically into his hairline and shock registers on his face. ""No fucking way! Princess?"" he asks, looking up at me, his mouth open and eyes wide in shock. ""What?"" ""Check your phone, Princess. This is going to blow your mind."" I do as he says, taking my phone out to look at it. I have a new text message. The words displayed across my screen from an unsaved number cause my heart to thaw, and I allow myself to take a risk. I allow just a bit of light to creep into my dark soul. This boy is full of light. It shines brightly through him and threatens to break down all of my defenses. Light will overshadow darkness, and I have been conditioned to protect myself from that. However, now that I have basically received a sign from the gods, I know for sure that following the lit path can be an okay thing to do. The light can be just as fun, right? Just as freeing? Truth is... I prayed for light, and I see now that it came in the form of a Prince. So, as I stare down at the text, I know now that vulnerability and discomfort are okay and baring my flaws is an okay thing to do. Last night, I showed my weird side to a complete stranger, and I did the same again today during the car ride to the beach. The gods saw fit that my darkness is flushed away, misery and loneliness all bathed in light. Light floods my insides with just one text. 12:30pm I told you we would meet again another time.

""Haven't you?"" There was no way she hadn't thought about it. She felt something other than lust for him. Maybe she wasn't in love with him yet, but she was getting there. Her fingers swept through his hair. ""Yeah, I have. I thought about how I can come out to you in month or so, and a few more times in between trips to Alaska and Ireland. And I thought maybe you'll figure out you can't be without me sometime in November so we can spend Christmas together, where you'd confess you're undying love for me and we get to live happily ever after."" There was no stopping his need to kiss her right then, under the stars, the same ones reflecting in her eyes. Already halfway on her body, she curled her arm over his shoulders to pull him above her. She tasted of wine and a hint of s'mores they had earlier. He had been inside her in the last few hours, found satisfaction between her lovely but strong thighs, yet his desire always returned just as hot as ever. Campfire light danced over her hair, highlighting shades of red. Fuck, she was beautiful. ""If you think it's going to take me nine months to fall for you,"" he whispered, his lips moving down her softly scented neck, earning a sweet, sweet moan. ""You're crazy."" She laughed softly, wrapping her arms tightly around his neck and head. ""Damn, I love this spot."" His teeth nipped the top curve of her breast, soothing it with brush of his lips. ""You mean it?"" He returned to her pretty mouth, her eyes wide open and questioning silently. ""I'm already on threshold, Bella, and we still have five days together. Trust me when I say I'm falling in love with you."" ""Oh God, so am I,"" she moaned, his tongue teasing her nipple. ""Do that again, please."" He chuckled and did as she asked. ""I'm falling for you, too."" Her thighs tightened around his hips, making him groan. ""We're really going to do this."" Her laughter was sweet and distracting. She took advantage of distraction and pushed him onto his back. There was no stopping his groan and the way his hips thrust up against her. She sat back to tease his cock between her thighs, a soft moan on her lips. Temptation had another name, and it was Bella. He filled his hands with her breasts, teasing her nipples between his long fingers. She tossed her head from side to side, her hips rolling over him. Potent desire threatened to unravel him, send him careening to an edge he wanted to take with her. She called out his name when his hands grabbed a hold of her hips, quickening her slow movements until she fell forward, her nails marking his chest. Her lips fit over his, taking his tongue just as he thrust inside her. ""Fuck,"" he hissed, holding her still for a moment. ""You feel so good."" She tested his endurance with a small dance of her hips and moaned when he slipped in deeper. ""Ah hell, love. Never enough."" He guided her body into a rhythm not too slow or fast, enough for it to build. His hands moved over her curves, already familiar to him but would never grow tired of. Her thighs started to tighten against his hips, a telltale sign she was close. ""Let go, Bella, let me see it."" She moaned deeply, pulling away from his chest until her hands gripped the tops of his thighs behind her. The view was stunning; a word he didn't use often. Long, dark hair teased his skin, her short nails adding a pinch of pain he loved. His hands skimmed over her heated skin, kissed by sun for the last few days. His fingers traced her hips and teased between her thighs. The look on her face drove him crazy, her soft lips parting for every breath, where his name often escaped, her eyes half-closed watching him. Edward felt her tighten around his cock, his gaze falling lower, cursing as he disappeared deep inside her. Her hips continued to roll, faster, harder, and as her gasps picked up in pitch and speed, he watched her fall apart. One of her hands tugged on her hair, the other gripping his wrist on her hip tightly. She swore and whispered his name, exhausted as she rested for two seconds on his chest. He captured her lips with his, holding her hips still, his own thrusting up into her, over and over until he realized she was coming again. His mouth touching hers, he called out her name as he released deep inside her. He wrapped his arms around her, the wind picking up suddenly, forcing him to cover their sweat slicked bodies with a sleeping bag. It was a few minutes later when he finally found the ability to speak again. ""How's that for a happy ending?"" She tried to smack his arm, but he grabbed her hand in time, bringing it to his lips to kiss. ""If you're going to want another one, you're going to have to give me a few more minutes."" They dived more deeply under the covers, laughing and smiling, as they discussed a future together. If someone saw a picture of them in that moment, they would say Bella and Edward were a couple deeply in love, who obviously adored one another. And they wouldn't be wrong.

""Paul throws them on the porch when he runs by. His version of romance."" ""Oh?"" Jasper swallowed thickly. Her lips were so close. ""I thought he wanted to kill you?"" ""Uh, it's kind of a love-hate thing."" She shrugged, licked his mouth, and sat up before ripping the plain white T-shirt from his body. His flannel shirt, and her own over shirt, had disappeared somewhere along the path through the woods. She had no idea where their boots and socks were. ""Oh,"" she breathed. Jasper stilled and remained motionless under her intense scrutiny. He wasn't ashamed of the battle scars that crisscrossed and slashed his torso, but he'd spent years covering them so as to not unduly alarm others, unless the situation required it. Most females had shied away from him when first seeing them—including Alice. He couldn't decipher Bella's expression and her emotions were suddenly blank to him. At least she hadn't run away. With the tip of her finger, Bella drew a faint line from the thick scar above his heart and down. She paused at the fine, golden brown hairs marking a trail from his navel and disappearing beneath his belt buckle. When her eyes snapped up to his, they glittered like faceted obsidian. He held his breath in wary anticipation, not having the first clue what she was thinking or feeling. ""Bella, I—"" ""Stop,"" she commanded. ""I've got a few of my own. Each and every mark is a battle you won—a bitch that tried to kill you and lost."" She peeled off her long-sleeved grey shirt and flung it across the room. ""You're the sexiest, most lickable fucking man I've ever seen."" He never got a chance to look her over for any scars, or anything else, because her left hand had a fistful of his hair, and her mouth was hungrily devouring his. Her right hand was unbuckling his belt. He was momentarily dazed when a wave of her needful lust and craving broke over him. He soon caught up with her, hooking his thumbs in her jeans and tearing them away. ""Bed?"" he gasped into her hair. He almost cried out when her hand wrapped around his dick. ""Up in the loft,"" she answered between licks and nips at his jaw. ""Never mind."" He rolled them until he was on his knees above her, but she never stopped her rhythmic strokes on his cock. When her teasing fingers gathered his precum and spread it down his achingly hard length, he couldn't hold back. It had been so long. Jasper groaned and grabbed her hand. ""If you keep doing that, I'm—"" ""Jasper."" Her voice was a sultry purr that sent a shot of blazing heat straight to his dick. ""Cum on me."" On her? Bella Swan certainly had changed. With his face buried in the hair at her neck, he let go and shuddered with each pulse of his orgasm and caress of her hand. When he regained his senses, he was flat on his back, and Bella was kneeling beside him, trailing kisses down his throat to his chest. When she reached a nipple, she took it between her teeth and tugged, grinning at him. He sat up, catching her face between his hands. He could hardly believe he was there with her. He'd spent a decade yearning for a mate he didn't know existed, and she'd been there the whole time. ""You waited here for ten years."" ""Yes,"" she whispered. ""You waited for me to come back for ten years ."" She reached to smooth the worried lines that formed on his brow. ""Yes."" He swallowed, suddenly unsure, and searched her dark, passion-filled eyes. ""But there's a history here."" She raised one eyebrow in challenge. ""Yes, there is."" Wrapping one hand around the back of her neck, Jasper brought her closer. ""Not Jacob Black. I know how you feel about him. But you've entertained several different shifters here in your cabin."" ""Mr. Nosy, aren't you? I feed them, and I make salsa and stuff to sell,"" was her nonchalant reply. ""They're my food tasters."" Jasper kissed the corner of her mouth and held his lips there. ""But there's one in particular … Paul?"" ""Well …"" She lowered her eyes. ""That's really more of a lust -hate relationship."" ""That's over now,"" he demanded, his tone deepening. A secret smile spread across her lips, and she kissed him lightly. "" If you're vampire enough to handle me."" The smile grew wider. ""Raised by wolves, remember?"" Nuzzling her jaw and cheek, Jasper paused at her ear. ""The little wolf girl is more of a vixen. Don't wolves mate for life?"" ""Typically."" Bella's breath quickened. ""He's not—"" Jasper tightened his hold on her neck and nudged her over onto her back, sliding smoothly in between her thighs. ""I think I can be vampire enough for the wolf girl."" He pressed the head of his fully aroused dick at her slick opening. Her breath caught as he entered her deliberately, inch by inch, and then she sighed in pleasure, a fire burning in her eyes. ""At least you smell a lot better."" The fierce hunger in Jasper's eyes held her transfixed as he gradually withdrew. ""I've waited my whole life for you."" A muted rumbling vibrated through his chest as his other hand slid down over her ass and gripped her as he thrust forcefully into her, causing her to cry out in ecstasy. ""I'm vampire enough to tame the wolf."" Please remember to leave the author some love!

185,4,16,4-Straight-thru-the-Heart-Fics-16.txt,twilight,StraightthrutheHeartFics,"enough for the both of us."" His eyes were hardened and a little mad – a reflection of my own. I could see the pain that he hid so well from the others. ""I cannot bear to see you suffer."" ""You hurt me more with your rejection."" ""I will not be your downfall!"" I was destroying him. He had to let me go, to move on into the new world without me. ""Sulpicia,"" he'd breathed, his expression softening. ""You have not and will never be my downfall. If you were to perish, I would go with you."" I'd ceased fighting him then, collapsing into his ever-loving embrace. ""I'm sorry,"" I sobbed, ""I'm sorry for everything I've caused."" He only held me wordlessly, shielding me from the monsters. Our conversation that night changed something within him. He changed, locking away the softest, the most human parts of himself, hiding it behind a veneer of smooth self-assurance. My beloved transformed into a different person before my eyes. He grew ruthless, searching the world far and wide for something that would cure me, for something that would make my crippled life easier to bear. Whereas before he'd allowed the Guard to come and go as they freely wished, this was no longer the case. Deviously, he used Charmion to bind their loyalties to us. He slaughtered Heidi's coven to acquire her, so that my feedings would be easier. He slaughtered countless more. And every night, he would bring iris to my room, the way he did our first evening together. ""You're a piece of heaven to me, Sulpicia,"" he would say, his grip so tight on my wrists that the pain would slice through my mind's cacophony. My chamber became filled with the flowers' fragrance, and their sweet scent became the single thing anchoring me to reality when the voices threatened to drown me. ""I have a gift for you,"" he'd told me one day. This time it was no trinket to brighten my room, or even a fresh kill. It was a young vampire, with burning scarlet eyes and hair of the same ilk. She bowed respectfully. ""Mistress, I am Corin."" Aro gave her a nod, and then it was as though all the heaviness in the world lifted from my chest. It was a shadow of Didyme's gift – not effusive happiness, but a dulled, lulling sensation. Contentment. For the first time in many centuries, my mind was clear again. The roaring voices faded to a quiet murmur in the back of my head. Aro had taken my hand, testing his theory, and then his smile had lit up my room. We made love that night. It was bittersweet – passion tinged with remorse – our first time since Didyme's death. He'd lain still in my arms for a long time after, his cheek pressed against my breast as he breathed in my scent. ""Aro, my love,"" I'd said softly. He'd opened his eyes, brilliant as the first day I'd seen them, eyes that had only grown more beautiful with the passing of time. ""Thank you for everything."" He'd kissed my forehead. ""Always, my Sulpicia."" We pressed against each other – skin to skin – and I had never felt so close to another being. I draw the shutters above shut. The floor is wet, my hair dripping from the rain. "" Would you like a towel, Mistress?"" Corin asks, kneeling before me. Her hair is so lovely – ruby tinged with gold and copper flowing down her willowy neck. I reach down and tilt the girl's face up. A long scar runs down her otherwise flawless countenance. A moment of insanity. My moment of insanity. They grow rarer and rarer in Corin's presence, but sometimes, I slip. The stronghold was never meant to protect me alone. "" Run along now,"" I say gently. ""I'm sure Anthenodora would be pleased to see you."" The girl bows and leaves silently. Her absence throbs. She is an addictive drug – but one I will gladly take as a balm for my madness. Without Corin, I was helpless. I dared not venture beyond the walls, afraid that the alienness of the new world would once again rouse the dying ghosts. ""Fear not, Sulpicia,"" Aro would say. ""All will be well."" And he continued to send envoys to comb the world, searching for talents that might one day banish my madness completely – that we might both be free again. It had been centuries since my mate last ventured out of Volterra himself. We exchanged no words on the subject, but I knew that it was his way of sharing my predicament – quiet atonement for the crime he'd buried to protect me. For as long as my madness remained, we were both prisoners within our own home. Aro will be here soon. I keep an awareness of his footfalls in the back of my mind. I follow them every moment of the day as he moves around our home and become uneasy when he remains still for too long. He knows this and avoids it. Renata's light patters echoes his, and she is prepared to shield him in the instance of any assault. He leaves her at the bottom of the tower. At the exact same hour, the same minute, the same second, every day, his footsteps make their way to my door. His whisper reverberates through the thick wood. "" Sulpicia."" And I open the door, as I always had, every day in the last thousands of years, and always would for many thousands more to come. Please remember to leave the author some love!

""Well,"" he started, ""I was thinking tonight we'd just have dinner and enjoy our room. There are some things we could do tomorrow or Sunday, but nothing's set in stone, aside from one thing tomorrow afternoon."" At my questioning look, he elaborated, ""A college buddy of mine just bought a house with his fiancée, so his apartment is becoming available soon. He pulled some strings so I could view it first."" I was dumbstruck. He would make such a decision without considering me or our relationship? The thought stung, making me realize I had fallen harder and faster for him than even I had suspected. I must have started crying because when he looked over at me, he hurried to assure me. ""Oh, shit, baby. I'm sorry. Whatever you're thinking right now, please wait 'til we're at the hotel so I can explain properly."" I nodded, although I wasn't sure spending the weekend at a hotel together would be the wisest thing to do after this. I hoped I was right to trust him. Thankfully, it didn't take us long to reach our destination, and I excused myself to freshen up in the bathroom off the lobby while Edward parked the car and checked us in. We were silent during the elevator ride to our floor, and I allowed him to guide me to our suite. My mind was working a mile a minute, thinking of the implications of what he'd said, while simultaneously trying to ignore those thoughts. The room must have been quite lovely, but in my frazzled state of mind I barely noticed. I sat down on the couch and turned tearful eyes to Edward when he sat down beside me. Resolution ""Are you seriously considering moving away from me?"" I asked. He grasped both my hands in one of his own, using his other hand to tilt my face up, seeking eye contact. ""Babe, that's not what's going on. It was a shitty way of telling you, but that apartment is not meant to take me away from you."" He wasn't making any sense to me, but I was at a loss for words, so I merely blinked away my tears. ""I'm not too keen on moving back to Port Angeles, but Forks is also not really a suitable option. For either of us. So when Jasper mentioned buying a house, I asked him about his apartment becoming available."" ""But… I don't understand. Your job is in Port Angeles…"" He smiled and squeezed my hands. ""That's just it. I'm working at a local office there. The head office is here, in Seattle, and they offered me a transfer."" I was happy for him at that prospect. I truly was, but I still didn't see how that could be beneficial to our budding romance. We were already juggling his work hours and commute, and that was only the next town over. How would a four-hour trip each way affect things? ""Honey, I can see the cogs turning in your head, but I think you're missing the point,"" he said, smiling gently at me. ""Then enlighten me,"" I challenged him. ""How is moving to Seattle going to work out for us when I'm stuck in Forks?"" ""You won't be! I know you haven't found a job there yet, but your chances will be much better here. When we go to look at the apartment, I want you to look at it for yourself as well, because I envision you there with me."" ""What are you saying?"" ""What I'm saying, is that I want you to move to Seattle with me."" Now I was struck silent for an entirely different reason than before. Did he truly see a future for us together? Were we ready for this? Wasn't it too soon? ""I know we haven't been together that long,"" he continued as though reading my mind, ""but these past few months have been the best I can remember. I can't imagine spending the rest of my life without you. I want us to make this decision together, to start over in a new place together. Tell me you want that, too,"" he practically begged. I could see the sincerity in his eyes and the hopeful expression on his face. There wasn't much else to do but nod at him. ""Yes,"" I whispered. I might as well have shouted it. He jumped up from his seat, gathered me in his arms, and spun us around while peppering kisses all over my face. ""Yes,"" I giggled. ""Yes, I'll move in with you!"" His lips captured my own, the kiss expressing his elation at my answer and the anticipation we had felt for this weekend. We moved into the bedroom of the suite, discarding clothes along the way. He ghosted kisses across my skin, bringing me to the brink over and over again before finally pushing inside me. I gasped at the delicious fullness, locking my legs around him. This was well worth the wait. There was a distinct sense of belonging I felt at being joined with him. Edward paused when he was all the way in, his hips resting against mine, and looked deep into my eyes. He was breathing heavily, looking at me with wonder. ""I love you, Bella,"" he said softly. That brought on a new round of tears, which he kissed away tenderly. ""I love you too,"" I confessed. Needless to say, we only ventured out of our hotel suite long enough to sign the lease on the apartment. Please remember to leave the author some love!

187,4,7,4-Straight-thru-the-Heart-Fics-7.txt,twilight,StraightthrutheHeartFics,"it open and found myself in the brightly lit lobby, a few people flitting about. Not a lion-maned man in sight. This was stupid. Did I think my hallelujah moment was going to make him appear in front of me with a frickin' halo? Did I think angels were going to lead me to my anonymous stranger? Ugh. So stupid. I shook my head, closing my eyes as I tried to determine what to do: go back and watch the rest of the stupid movie or just walk home? Home it is, I thought, looking at the multi-colored carpet as I speed walked my way across the lobby. I passed the concessions stand and while the rough sex had made me hungry, I wasn't in the mood for popcorn, so I walked on without looking. ""Hey!"" Someone at the concessions stand yelled. I turned around to see my beautiful stranger making his way to me from behind the popcorn machine. He was wearing a shirt with the movie theater's logo on it, which I hadn't noticed earlier; I had obviously been distracted by other parts of him. I stood motionless, as I waited nervously for him to reach me. I'd walked out of the movie hoping to find him, but now I had absolutely no clue what to say, and I nervously twirled my hair around my finger as I watched him. Hallelujah, what a beautiful creature. ""You work here?"" I asked as if that wasn't both obvious and extraordinarily unimportant. ""Yeah. You watching a movie?"" He smiled a beautiful magazine-cover smile at me. ""Um. I walked out. Stupid movie, bad company,"" which wasn't at all the "" I wanted to find you, you gorgeous demi-God"" that was really on the tip of my tongue. But he seemed to like my answer anyway as his smile grew bigger. ""Wanna watch a better one with me?"" His eyes twinkled as he held out his hand, and I didn't think twice about placing my own in it. ""Definitely. No, wait. One condition."" ""Well, you can't backtrack after a 'definitely' like that, but sure,"" he winked. ""I want to know your name by the end of the movie."" He just laughed at me. ""How about now?"" He stood up straighter, shaking my hand with the same hand that had previously been holding his absolutely admirable appendage. ""I'm Edward Cullen. And you are?"" ""Bella Swan,"" I replied, suddenly feeling shy. ""Nice to finally meet you, too."" ""Do tell me how you two met, Isabella?"" I was sitting on a pristine beige couch, sipping tea from a flowery cup, wearing my Sunday best. My white blouse had been ironed, my navy skirt was brand new, my shoes were sleek yet modest, and my pantyhose were, miraculously enough, holding up without any holes and ladders in them. Edward's mother was sitting in front of me, looking far more put-together than I did despite all my effort, and her question was innocent enough, but it almost made me choke on my tea as I remembered our first meeting. ""Um. We met at the movie theater, Mrs. Cullen. I went to see a movie, he was working that night, and the rest is history."" Hey, I wasn't lying. Mrs. Cullen huffed a little, and I was glad Edward had prepped me: his mother hated his job, saying that it wasn't necessary to do something quite as common . She was rich and stuffy and everything about her screamed Old Money. However, Edward had wanted to work while finishing his studies and had gone against his mother's wishes. I knew the huffing was mostly her annoyance about his job and where he spent most of his time. That old, art-deco theater where we'd met had been in his father's family for decades, and he loved the place. Seemed Edward had inherited not only the building but also his dad's passion for movies; another reason his mother was so against it. That, or she was just really displeased with the fact that her son was now dating a commoner , and couldn't find it in her to be polite about it. ""And my son informed me that you are moving in together, is that correct?"" ""Yes, ma'am,"" I nodded as Edward walked back into the room. ""Is that not a tad… overzealous? Too soon?"" Mrs. Cullen asked, clearly not approving of our decision. ""Mother!"" Ah, thank you, Edward, for saving me from the rest of this conversation. ""We've talked about this. It's been four months; we just hadn't had a chance to let you meet Bella yet. And it's our decision."" Mrs. Cullen simply nodded. ""I will go and get you some more tea. Excuse me."" She stood up and stiffly walked off towards the kitchen. I exhaled a shaky breath. I was so incredibly uncomfortable with all of this. The money, the beige couch, the cleanliness, the Old Money culture, the fact that I wasn't wearing my trusty jeans, the disapproving mom… ""Hey,"" Edward whispered in my ear. ""Wanna sneak off to the bathroom?"" His mind was clearly in the same gutter as mine was, remembering the way we started, and how I made the best decision ever by walking into the men's room that day. My loud snort was undoubtedly heard in the kitchen. His mind was clearly in the same gutter as mine was, remembering the way we started, and how I made the best decision ever by walking into the men's room. Revolutionary feminism, indeed.

He doesn't know what to do. He doesn't know what he feels. Alice is bleeding . ""Jasper."" His hands are shaking as he touches Alice's cooling skin, searching for a pulse that is not there, smearing crimson across the curve of cheek that once blushed. Sooty lashes and a partially opened mouth. No movement. Jasper wants to heave, but he cannot. The shattering behind his ribs is all consuming- ""Jasper,"" Rosalie hisses, snapping her fingers in front of his face. ""You can save her."" He shakes his head, hands still ghosting over Alice's body. ""No. I can't. That's not what we do. That's not…That's not what we…"" Rosalie slaps him, then grips his chin, forcing him to look at her, silver eyes blazing. ""Jasper, listen to me. You can save her. You're not like us, somehow. Why else would we be here? Look around you! The street is empty! There's nobody here for a reason! This is Fated . Save her."" Jasper blinks, collecting his thoughts. Rosalie is right about the scene, at the very least. They, being what they are, are the only ones present for a reason , a sure design by Fate and obviously sanctioned by at least one of their masters. They are supposed to be here and Alice was Fated to this . But Jasper isn't different from the other Sons, is he? He was dragged unwillingly into this life, just like them. He has the same gifts of empathy, just as they do. But he does not believe in love. Is that the difference? He had never moved beyond his death, had remained unchanged for thousands of years. Had he not argued against the existence of love not twelve hours earlier? He looks down at Alice, crumpled and quiet and bleeding. He hurts . Oh, Eros, but is this what love is supposed to be? And could he love without realizing it? This girl? He'd once thought her salvation, had deemed her perfect, had enjoyed her company and idiosyncrasies, and had looked forward to hearing her speak and seeing the way her eyes lit up when she smiled. He'd enjoyed the pleasures of her body, cherished those moments, even. And this - this feeling - was different from the feeling that led to his death. Because he wasn't human, anymore? He may have cynically stated that humans were not altruistic enough to truly love, but that certainly wasn't true. He'd loved true enough to gain a second chance. Was the same true for Alice? Fighting back the burning behind his eyes, Jasper leans down, close enough to catch the scent of vanilla and almonds and tea, close enough to brush his lips with Alice's. He thinks, I love you . He kisses her, praying that Rosalie is right and that Fate is right and that he is a different Son of Eros and that his love - and it is love - for Alice is true enough to bring her back. Jasper pulls back a fraction, strokes her cheek gently, and waits. Breathless. He is sure that he will die alongside Alice, the burning is so pervasive, so sharp and searing in his chest. Burning brighter and sharper, stinging and narrowing and traveling down his arms, to his tattoos - Rosalie gasps. Jasper can see why and he is just as startled. The tattoos on his wrists are glowing, aching, burning, bright silver in the middle of the street, the light sinking into Alice at an alarming rate. He's never seen anything like it, never heard anything about this before - Alice gasps, her back arching beneath the onslaught of silver light, her eyes shooting open, just as silver as Jasper's, but somehow more beautiful. She looks at him, panting, grasping his hands as blood seeps back into her body, as her body is fixed by - by the strength of Jasper's love for her - ""I love you,"" he says, urgent. ""I have loved you, I think for a long while. And I am not ready to let you leave me, Alice."" ""Jasper?"" He kisses her forehead, clutches her close to his chest, protectively and possessively. ""It's difficult to explain,"" he murmurs against her warm skin, feeling hollowed from the inside out. ""But I promise you, beloved, that our time is not over yet."" Alice looks up at him dreamily, strokes an errant curl from his face. ""I knew you loved me. I knew it."" And thus sweet Alice becomes something new altogether, a Lover of the Son of Eros. Just as Fate demanded. Watching from above, Aphrodite runs her hands through the soft curls atop Eros' head. ""Why him?"" Eros smiles, turning his face up to kiss the palm of his Goddess. ""He's paid his dues. All of our children will have this opportunity, eventually. Fate is never-ending, my love, as you well know."" ""And does he know he was the first of your Sons?"" Her lover shrugs, looking down through the clouds of their heavenly realm to watch his First Son love his soulmate as surely as he was meant to, as surely as Fate would have it. ""I suspect it doesn't matter, now, though I'm certain he'll figure it out when other gifts begin to manifest. Perhaps he will notice her gifts before his own. We shall see."" Aphrodite hums and smiles. ""And shall you be possessing any other professors, my darling cupid?"" Eros smirks. ""Well, Professor Greene was right, wasn't he? Love is healing."" ""So I've heard.""

Her actions loosen the belt holding her dainty robe closed. ""Holy nipples,"" Edward exclaims and swallows the saliva collecting in his mouth. His Adam's apple bobs with the act. The erection he finally got under control earlier bulges against his zipper. She eyes the entire length of his body, maybe she was wrong with her first assessment. She approaches him slowly, slinking like a lithe predator. Finally, she reaches him, noticing the bonze rug on his chest. Manly. Rugged. So many thoughts filter through her subconscious. She places her hand on his chest to test if the hair is as as soft as it looks. Putting her cheek against the velvety cushion of hair, she sighs. Rising and falling, his heart is about to hammer out of his chest. His scent is enough to send her in a tizzy. This woman has him so worked up that his glasses have fogged from their heavy breathing. Edward pulls the heavy frames from his face to rub the condensation from them. The process pushes her away from him, her bosom heaves. ""Ma'am, if you can't control your actions, I'm going to have to lock you up at the precinct,"" he says, trying to shake away the wicked thoughts forming in his mind. A woman has never treated him this way, even if she's someone you have to pay for their affection—literally. ""Oh, I'll let you lock me up, big boy,"" she says, holding her wrists out for him to cuff them. Delicately, he places the cool metal rings below her hands, brushing them in the process. Electricity pulses between the two of them. After leading her to the back of the squad car, Edward opens the door and slowly places her inside. At the last minute Isabella grabs him by the belt and yanks him inside with her latching her lips to the skin below his ear. Flustered he scrambles up, ripping her robe completely off and snapping one of the straps to her garter belt while trying to escape her clutches. She giggles as he clumsily exits the back seat and slams the door in her face. The cool air sobers him up slightly, but doesn't clear his scattered thoughts, so he beats his head on the hood of his car. Filling up his lungs with the cool air, he shakes his head to rid his brain of the filthy thoughts. Edward then gets back into the car and adjusts the gear shift to drive. ""I live in the white two-story house back there,"" she says right before she passes out with her face pressed against the metal bars of the divider. A small chuckle escapes his lips as he shifts from drive to reverse, backing up to the quaint little house she pointed out before she fell asleep. He leaves the driver's seat and pulls her out of the back seat, cradling her small frame close to him. She left the door to her house cracked, but thankfully this is a quiet night so no one broke in while she was gone. Edward softly places her on the cushy couch and grabs a tattered quilt off a chair to cover her body with. Room by room he searches to make sure there are no intruders. The house surprises him. He was expecting a dungeon of sin, but he was met with light colors and a beachy feel to the place. Feeling like he's overstayed his welcome, he checks on this strange woman once more. Smalls snores greet him, and he laughs once more. He smooths her hair away from her forehead and places a small kiss on it. Shocked by his actions, Edward scrambles out the door and runs to his cruiser to wait until morning when he's off. After he clocks out, he drags himself out the door and drives home, not able to get the alluring lady in red out of his head. He tosses and turns, unable to sleep. His alarm finally goes off, him not sleeping a wink. Skipping his usual routine, he showers and throws on some clean clothes. Careful not to break any speeding laws, he drives over to the mystery woman's house—to check on her, of course. He grabs a few daffodils growing beside the walk up to her house. Knocking on the door, he starts to feel some hope. Slowly, she opens the door, fresh faced, with her dark and wet hair thrown up in a messy bun on the top of her head. Baggy, blue, striped linen pajamas hang loosely on her frame. His grin apparently isn't catching as a frown is displayed on her face. ""No solicitors welcome,"" she barks as she slams the door in his face. A loud bang startles them both out of their current day dreams. ""Are you two love birds going to tell us what y'all are thinking about instead of telling us how you two met?"" Alice asks impatiently. The couple cracks up, and Edward exclaims, ""It was love at first sight!"" ""You thought I was a prostitute,"" Bella cries. ""You were sleepwalking, an easy mistake. Still doesn't mean I couldn't fall in love with you at first sight,"" he states, grabbing his new bride and planting a big, wet sloppy kiss on her lips. The group around them laughs and cheers as Edward and Bella stare at one another, knowing that even though they met in a truly unconventional way, the love of their lives was found on the cold February morning.

Edward pours himself into the music, moving swiftly back to the higher scale, while Mike fills in the harmony. Edward's open joy in that moment is a revelation. It's almost as though I'm seeing him clearly for the first time. There's no filter of family or friends, no school or work or expectations. I only see the man, and it just pierces through my heart… without a shadow of doubt, I know that I love him. I love his joy, the light in his eyes, and the intensity of his soul. And the way his ass looks in those blue jeans, bobbing up and down as he stands hunched over the piano is kind of hot as well. I appreciate the view wholeheartedly. They bring the song to a close with a very 'Edward' flourish, and both men straighten up and acknowledge the applause with nods and smiles. I'm amused to see that a fist bump is all the acknowledgement they need to give each other. I stand, my heart pounding so loudly, I'm sure the people around me can hear it. Almost immediately, Edward turns towards me, as though aware of my location even in this crowd of people. A dazzling smile spreads over his features when he sees me for the first time in two weeks. Ignoring the other passengers, who are still fawning over him, he walks over and hugs me tight. For a moment, nothing exists but the two of us. A feeling of completeness washes over me. I can't resist smirking up at him like the smartass I am. ""So, did you just drop by to play the piano?"" He steps back, looking a little embarrassed, but doesn't let go entirely. ""I couldn't take it anymore,"" he says, looking apologetic, though why he would want to apologize for giving me the best surprise of my life, I don't know. ""I was trying my best to be a good friend and give you time and space and all that, but did you really need to email me details of every single guy who tried to hit on you? Geez girl, I thought I made it clear how I felt about you."" ""What? I tried to tell you as much as possible so that you wouldn't miss me too much."" That's my story and I'm sticking to it. ""All it did was make me miss you more. When I couldn't take it anymore, I bought a ticket, called in a few favors and got two weeks off. I promise I won't dog your heels or cramp your style. But maybe if you let me, we could intersect at a few places? I mean, we could meet up a few times while you're in Amsterdam, and then in Berlin, and so on? If I can just see you and reassure myself, it'll keep me from going completely crazy. I promise I won't…"" He would have rambled on for hours, by the sound of it, and it was completely unnecessary. So, I cut him off with a kiss, every bit as hot as the one he had sent me off with. Considering that we had only kissed once before, it's quite ridiculous how much I missed the taste of his lips. I missed the feel of his soft hair under my fingertips and his rough stubble on my cheek. I missed the warmth of his hard, muscled chest, and the feeling of comfort and home I get the moment he wraps me up in his strong arms. I can't express all the things he makes me feel in words, so I try to show him with my lips. I think he understands; we are demanding, aggressive, playful and tender all at once. Can a kiss be so much? I wouldn't have thought so, but that was before Edward. When I finally pull back, he looks at me with so much love that it steals my breath as surely as he steals my heart. ""You're coming with me,"" I state, not leaving room for argument. ""What, just like that? I had a plan, you know. An insidious, convoluted, devious plan to gradually break down your defenses and get you to travel with me,"" he chuckles. I roll my eyes and smile, absently drawing a series of small hearts with my fingertip over his heart. I think he realizes it a moment before I do, because he stills, and smiles, even as I whisper, ""I love you."" I barely notice the crestfallen look Mike shoots us as he gathers his bags and shuffles off. It doesn't last, of course. He's taken perhaps four steps when this perky young thing, all short shorts and unnaturally shiny hair, accosts him. I would say something insightful about how she's exuding the 'let's get laid' hormone by the bucketful, and how Mike's got that wolfish 'I'm getting lucky' look in response; but the fact is, I don't particularly care. I'm much too busy kissing the man I have loved for a year, the man who loves me enough to let me go live my dreams, and to follow me wherever I go. We're interrupted by the echoing announcement for my… our train to Amsterdam. As we quickly gather our things and run to the platform, I can't stop smiling. I get the feeling that loving Edward will be the best adventure I've ever had. Please remember to leave the author some love!

""What if what ?"" My brows scrunch together. ""What if we're not soulmates? What if there's someone else out there for you?"" Realization travels from my brain throughout my body. My fists curl, my jaw clenches, and my voice snares. ""You mean to say, what if there's someone else out there for you. "" The fact that she looks away is frightening. Besides my intestines knotting, my back stiffens. My voice is suspended in mid-air between us. ""Is there someone else?"" My words threaten to asphyxiate me. She doesn't answer and refuses to look in my direction. ""Bella?"" Even though I'm waiting for an answer, there's only one I will accept. A sound escapes her throat, and I want to believe it's an emphatic no, but she's nodding. Fucking nodding . Her curls fall forward, hiding her face, which I can't stomach anymore. Tears burn my eyes. Bella is talking, but there's a whooshing in my ears, and I only hear snippets of what she's saying. She's sorry. She never meant for any of this to happen. She wishes she would have told me sooner. She hopes I can forgive her. I'm about to throw up. ""Who is it?"" I yank the stupid bowtie off, but my throat is still constricted. ""Who's who ?"" I narrow my eyes at her. ""The guy — who is it?"" She shakes her head. ""No one you'd know."" ""Bullshit! Is it James from work? Peter? It's fucking Garrett, isn't it?"" ""It doesn't matter, Edward."" ""It matters to me!"" Bella croaks a name, but I hear her loud and clear. I envision fifty ways to make James die—none of them are pleasant. ""How long?"" I clear my throat before I ask the question I don't want to know the answer to. ""How long have you two been… been… "" I can't finish. My hands drag through my hair. ""We haven't,"" she says. I blow out what little breath I have left in my lungs at the small consolation prize. And then she slides a knife into my gut. "" Yet ."" Those butterflies I felt in my stomach earlier? They just died. ""Do you love him?"" Bella replies with a shrug and a shake of her head. ""You're willing to throw away everything we have for something completely unknown?"" ""I don't know, okay?"" Her voice rises. ""Why the fuck are you pissed off?"" I demand. ""I wasn't expecting an interrogation."" ""You thought I'd be okay with this? Let you walk away from me without answering any fucking questions? I'm a lot of things, Bella, but I'm not a fucking idiot."" She places her hand on my arm. I flinch and she withdraws it, but where her fingers touched still stings. ""Edward."" The way she says my name, her voice like saccharin, is genuine. It breaks my heart a little more. ""I'm so, so sorry. James and I, we were working on that project together, remember?"" Of course I remember. Weeks of overtime, my calls going unanswered, promises that everything would go back to normal when the project was done. And it did. At least, I thought it did. ""There's something between us. I can't ignore it."" Bella continues talking and I hear her, but I'm unable to comprehend anything. The words are foreign and make no sense. I watch a bug by my feet. It walks left, cocks its head, walks right, and cocks its head again; over and over. His zig-zag approach is so he can visualize targets or danger. He's alert; en garde . I lift my foot, and the bug flattens under the weight of my sole. Dead before he knows what hit him. Completely blindsided. I know exactly how it feels. I point inside the church. ""What am I supposed to tell everyone in there?"" ""Tell them I'm a horrible person, because I am."" She is, she really is. But I fucking love her. Even now, with my heart obliterated and splayed on the sidewalk, I still love her. ""I'm going to… I should probably go."" Bella stands and my anger gives way to desperation. I reach out and catch hold of her dress. I shake my head, tears drip from my eyes, and I beg, fucking beg her to stay. As futile as trying to empty the ocean into a thimble, I try to change her mind. ""Bella, don't do this. Please . We don't have to get married today. I can wait. I will. Just please don't leave me."" Like a mother frees herself from her child's desperate clutches, she peels my fingers one by one off the silk of her skirt. ""I'm so sorry."" She holds my hands in hers and stares into my eyes. ""You're going to be okay, Edward."" I shake my head. I won't be okay. I don't think I'll ever be okay again. Bella releases my hands. She says nothing as she gathers her shoes and her veil. I watch her leave. She walks away from me, her heels in one hand and my heart in the other. The train of her dress drags on the sidewalk behind her. She keeps walking and doesn't look back. Memories wash over me; from a five-year-old's crush to the crushing pain in my chest. Bella, the girl whose name alone makes me smile, the woman I lost my virginity to on a rain-soaked Sunday afternoon, is disappearing from view. The kaleidoscope of memories all come back.

192,4,2,4-Straight-thru-the-Heart-Fics-2.txt,twilight,StraightthrutheHeartFics,"accept him after everything he'd done to her. He'd gifted her loneliness, not knowing misery would be his eternal company. He'd carved out a curse on her skin, unaware that his regret would be a far painful brand on his very soul. Ed'vard had wanted to destroy Earth, and now it was all he had left. Ed'vard watched Bella from afar. And he wept when he got closer. The stick in her hand and the black shades on her eyes didn't reveal she was blind as glaringly as her stumble. Her glasses fell off to reveal her icy-blue eyes. His tears flew unbidden while he watched her in front of him. His Icharin had taken her sight. Ed'vard moved forward to take her hand and guide her toward the other side of the road. Memories came rushing, and this time, they weren't choking and unknown—they were familiar and damning. He watched her life as it had gone for the past two years. J'ames was no longer part of her life because she'd forbidden him. He'd found his Inishen, and Bella had made him promise her he would never seek her out or materialize even when she called for him. She knew she was cursed, and that knowledge had propelled her to distance herself from everyone. ""Thank you for your kindness,"" Bella said with a small smile before turning around and walking away from him. Kindness ? Ed'vard was the one who'd made her life Hell on Earth. He was the reason she could never find love or live a happy life. He should plunge his sword into his very heart, but he was selfish, and his new need to experience the world was too tempting for him to even attempt an act of selflessness. Ed'vard dared to enter her room in the dark hours of the night. There were canvases all around containing heartbreaking beauty. He moved toward the bed where Bella slept, aware he wasn't worthy of even a touch of her skin. Yet, he couldn't stop his fingers as they traced the red-gold abused flesh of her cheek. As he did so, Bella moved toward his hand, as if she were seeking comfort. The thought that she needed him pleased him greatly. What he wouldn't have given for her to look at him as she had looked at J'ames on that cursed day in her meadow. Ed'vard knelt beside her bed, and she turned to face him in her sleep. It felt as if she instinctively knew he was here. It was the first and last time he was ever going to taste her. He leaned toward her, and his lips met hers softly. She tasted like virtue, like a forgotten taste he didn't even knew he craved. He could feel her innocence on his tongue. What were the Fates thinking when they had paired him with her? Bella was going to have all the happiness in the world. He was going to reverse the punishment he so unwittingly had awarded her. After all, it was the least he could do for her after everything he'd done. He couldn't stop the tear which fell on her cheek from his eyes. It was goodbye. Ed'vard watched her joy when Bella opened her eyes in the morning to take in all the colors she'd missed in two years. Her joy was the most beautiful thing he'd ever witnessed. Months flew. She got accepted into the Harvard Visual Arts Programme. He made sure she would have nothing to worry about. Her fee was paid. She lived in a posh apartment and had a pricey car. She never questioned where these things came from. He simply signed the cards accompanying everything as ""Yours."" Because that's who he was—hers and only hers. Maybe Bella knew. Maybe she smelt the guilt and regret in everything he did for her. Did she ever feel his desperate love? She called for him. Every night, she called his name. Edward . She only said Edward, and he found he liked it. Ed'vard was dead as he should've been when he'd first opened his eyes. He saw the world when he wasn't looking out for her. Truth be told, he ran to the other side of the world when she went out with any boy. Her date nights were a source of his torture. Thankfully, she'd only kissed a few. He didn't know what was going to happen to him when she finally accepted an invitation to spend the night at their place. Bella was calling his name again that night, and his desire to materialize in her bedroom and see her face up close was very tempting. He wondered how she looked when she said his name. ""Edward, please,"" she called again. The yearning in her voice was very similar to what he felt. He couldn't stop himself this time. She wasn't sleeping as he'd envisioned. Bella was propped against her headboard, her sketchbook opened in her lap. Across the room, her eyes met his and she repeated, ""Edward, please."" He didn't know he'd crossed the room till she was in his arms; her face so close to his. Her brown eyes held everything he felt. Somehow, she'd found in her heart to forgive him. He wasn't a fool enough to question it. ""I called for you."" Edward nodded. ""I know."" ""Why didn't you come?"" Bella asked. ""I thought I didn't deserve you."" ""Stupid man,"" she said before burying her head in the crook of his neck. ""I know,"" he sighed, holding her tightly. He was never letting her go again.

""Here, use my cell,"" he carries on, placing the cell in my hand. I look down at it, and I know there's only one person I need. Dialing the number, I listen to the ringing for a few moments, praying they're not fully asleep yet. ""Hello. Cullen,"" my father says, sounding confused. ""Dad,"" I whimper out. ""Edward? Son?"" he says, sounding worried. ""I need you,"" I tell him. ""It's Bella … Dad,"" I cry out, dropping to the floor, no longer able to stand. ""Son,"" my dad says softly. I wake up and look at him. Frowning, I look around the room and notice I'm in a hospital bed. As I wake, I start to remember what happened. Oh my God, Bella. What happened to Bella? ""Bella! How is Bella?"" I ask, scrambling out of the bed. ""Slow, Edward,"" he orders, but I move out of the room and run to where she was last. ""Charlie!"" I yell as I walk into her room. I feel all of the breath leave my body when I see her strapped up to so many machines. ""Sit down, son,"" Charlie says as he helps me to the chair. ""Mr. Swan,"" the voice of the doctor who's looking after Bella mumbles as he walks into the room. ""Sir, you have to leave,"" he orders me, but I don't look his way. ""No, he's fine here. Just tell me about my daughter,"" Charlie states. Present day … Valentine's Day ""It's been six weeks, Mr. Swan. Your daughter is not showing any signs that she's going to wake up. We feel that it's time to switch off her life support."" I ignore the doctor and move to my girl. ""I'm here, Topsy, so don't be afraid, because I'm going to hold on to you. I'm holding on with everything I have. Don't you let go,"" I beg her. I move onto her bed and lie down next to her, putting my arm around her and holding her as close as I can. ""Do you know that it's now Valentine's Day? So why don't you wake up so we can spend it together?"" I ask her as I move her hair from her face. ""Edward,"" Charlie mutters softly. ""It's time,"" he says barely above a whisper, but I shake my head at him. ""You know she wouldn't have wanted to live like this."" He stops talking, and I hear a faint sob. I know I'm selfish, but I'm unable to let her go. Not now … not ever. ""Take the love you shared; use that to move on,"" he pleads with me. ""There is no moving on, not without her. My sky cannot light up if my sun is no longer here!"" I yell without looking at him. ""Sir, I need to look her over."" The doctor huffs, and I'm pulled forcefully away. I stand and watch her, telling her with my mind that I'm here and not to let go. As the doctor moves out of the way, I walk to her and hold her hand. My eyes stay locked with her closed ones. ""Edward, you should say goodbye,"" Charlie says as if he was choking on the words, and I shake my head. ""No! I am not saying goodbye. I am not letting her go!"" I yell out, covering my ears, not wanting to hear them tell me I'm going to lose her. I feel Charlie wrap his arms around me. ""It's going to be okay, son,"" he sobs, and I feel a sob race through my body as I hug him back. ""We're switching it off now,"" the doctor tells us, and slowly, the beeping that has been a constant noise in the room slows. There is a new beep, and I know the doctor has switched off the monitor. There's a rush of sparks shooting through my heart, and I suddenly feel as if things are going to be okay. ""Hold on, baby. Hold on,"" I mumble to her as the sobs echo around me. Moving closer, I kiss her lips. ""Topsy, please ,"" I whisper into them, kissing them again. As I pull back, my eyes look straight into her scared ones. ""Doctor!"" I yell, dropping to my knees. ""Stay with me, Topsy. Stay with me!"" I call as her eyes start to flutter. Again, I'm pulled away from her as the room is filled with more medical staff. Standing near the window in the room, I watch as they move around her. I close my eyes as the side of my face is hit by the sun that's just come out, parting dark clouds in its path. ""Where's Edward?"" I hear my girl mumble, and I know that my sun is here to stay. She's going to be okay; we're going to be just fine. Knowing she still has a lot of healing to do doesn't discourage me, and I'm going to be with her every step of the way. The doctor moves, and I can see her. Her eyes are still open, but she looks tired. I smile at her, whispering my love to her. I know our love for one another brought her back. The fact it happened on today of all days shows me that many things played a part in her return. I don't know if it was God, Cupid, or a Valentine's miracle, but I know love will always persevere.

We both knew without speaking what had to happen. I could see it in Jake's eyes, and he could see it in mine. When I opened my mouth to speak, he stopped me with a kiss. ""It's okay, Ness. It was more than worth it,"" he said, his eyes filled with emotion. I couldn't stop myself tugging him close for another kiss, which quickly became hard and furious, threatening to lead to a repeat of the previous night. When we finally separated, Jake very deliberately distanced us so our naked bodies were no longer pressed together. ""I think you should get dressed, honey. You're entirely too tempting,"" he explained with a laugh. Thinking he was just as distracting, we collected our clothes, which were strewn all across the forest floor. Thanks to the warm sunlight, the snow hadn't made them too wet. But once we finished tugging on our jeans and tops, the hard cold reality set in. Jake and I just stood there staring at each other for what felt like forever, unwilling to do what had to happen. Finally, I broke the silence. ""We should do this fast. Not drag it out. It'll be better…"" I whispered, hugging my arms to my chest. I didn't really believe the words, and I was sure Jake knew it. But he nodded anyway. He looked as if he were about to speak; however, he then seemed to change his mind. Instead, he drew me close and kissed me softly, sweetly, lovingly. It was a goodbye kiss. Sucking in a deep breath, I forced back my rampaging emotions and ran my fingers through Jake's hair one last time. Then, I moved my hands so they covered his eyes. ""Don't watch. Keep your eyes closed,"" I choked out, my heart thundering in my chest. Again, Jake nodded without speaking. I wondered if maybe he couldn't bring himself to talk, as if saying it out loud would make it real. But then suddenly his deep voice was reaching my ears one last time. ""Goodbye, Ness,"" he whispered, the words shaky. I couldn't blame him, as I gritted my teeth to hold back a sob. ""Goodbye, Jake,"" I replied, unable to resist kissing him lightly one last time. Then, with a whimper that came right from my very soul, I spun around and walked away. It took everything I had to keep myself breathing, to stop myself from collapsing beneath the pain in my heart. How was I supposed to do this? How could I go back to being alone when Jake now held my heart? How was I going to survive? It had only been thirty seconds, and already my will to leave was crumbling. Already my soul yearned to return to its mate. My feet didn't want to walk, and only the thought of Jake getting hurt kept me moving. I stumbled through the forest like I was drunk, oblivious to my surroundings. So oblivious I didn't notice someone was leaning against my rental car until I was just a few feet away. And it wasn't just someone. It was Jake. I gaped at him, at a loss for words. What was he doing here? How had he beaten me back? How had I not noticed his presence? I had so many questions, but I couldn't make my mouth move to ask them. But Jake, wonderful and caring Jake, knew exactly what I was thinking. He always did. ""It took me all of two seconds to realize I couldn't let you leave again,"" he said hoarsely, his gaze fierce as he watched me. I forced myself to stay where I was and not walk any closer, even though all I wanted to do was run into his arms. ""Jake, please don't try to stop me. I have to go. You know that. I can't stand it if—"" I said, my body shaking with tension. Yet before I could finish my protest, Jake was surging forward, cupping my face with his hands, silencing me. ""I'm not here to stop you, Ness,"" he answered, his eyes alight. Then, to my amazement, he grinned. ""I'm going with you."" … Leaving La Push was a very different experience to entering it. When I had arrived, I had been full of fear and excitement and worry, my emotions rolling, out of control. Now, sitting in the passenger seat of my rental car, I was calm. I was calm and filled with all different emotions. Surprise. Happiness. Peace. Love. Shifting in my seat, I glanced over at Jake. After half an hour of making out against the side of the car, he had insisted on driving. I hadn't had the energy to protest, dizzy with desire. Even then, I was still filled with the electricity of his touch, hyper aware of his presence. By the amount of looks he was throwing my way, the feeling was mutual. If he hadn't been a shapeshifter, I would have been worried about how little attention he was paying to the road, and how often his eyes lingered on me instead. But he was supernatural. We were both were. And we could live together forever. If we wanted to, that was. I wasn't sure if I loved Jake yet. Everything had been such a whirlwind, and I was still trying to process it all. But I knew I would one day. I had no doubt. I could feel it in my heart. And my heart also knew one day he would love me, too. Please remember to leave the author some love!

A low groan escaped his mouth when his tongue stroked mine. The kiss went deeper and deeper until we were both lost in the passion of it all. That was until an annoyingly familiar voice interrupted our passion and brought me back to Earth with a bang. ""Come on, lover boy,"" Jasper said. To be honest, I had forgotten all about him. Blushing, I looked down to hide my embarrassment, but Edward gently lifted my chin to meet his gaze. He placed a soft kiss against my cheek before leaning down to whisper in my ear. ""That was just a taste of things to come when you become my wife."" He winked and ran away before I could even think to respond. I didn't get back to sleep after that. I tossed and turned all night, replaying the kiss and his parting words over and over in my mind. I couldn't wait to see Edward again. Whether it be alcohol induced or not, he had declared his feelings. It was time I finally confessed mine. That was exactly what I intended to do, right up until the moment I spotted a rather sheepish looking Edward creeping up to the house. I had been so excited to see him, but one look at his face, and I felt my optimism dwindle. The small smile he sent my way did little to put me at ease. The silence was deafening and more worrying still. He looked embarrassed, ashamed, and he seemed reluctant to meet my eye. I thought for certain he had felt it too, but then I realized it was wishful thinking on my part. In the cold light of day, I could see he regretted kissing me. It was written all over his face, and his opening words confirmed my worst fears. ""Bella, I'm so sorry about last night."" Edward finally met my eyes. I wished he hadn't. The remorse and shame that filled them silenced any I intention I had of confessing my love to him. ""I don't know what I was thinking turning up like that."" He had now started rubbing the back of his neck furiously, and I struggled to keep my expression impassive as he continued to ramble on. ""I don't know how much I had to drink, but it was enough. I hoped you would be at the dance, but when you didn't show, I kept drinking. I wanted to see you, so I decided to come to you. I don't know what I was thinking."" I could see he was trying so hard to apologize, but all I felt was emptiness and anger, of which Edward bore the brunt. ""Well, perhaps you should have thought about that before you came here and kissed me like that,"" I snapped. He looked taken aback, but Edward quickly recovered. ""Bella, please,"" he started to say, but I'd heard enough, and I told him as much. ""Don't you Bella me! How could you do this to me, Edward? I thought we were finally getting somewhere. You made me think you felt it too, but all you wanted was a cheap thrill. For all I know, you could make a habit out of kissing other girls when you've had a skinful."" The venom in my voice seemed to silence him temporarily, but when he recovered, Edward made no attempt to hide his anger. ""Now, you listen here, Bella. I meant everything I said last night. There's only ever been you. You've had my heart since I was sixteen years old. How can you doubt it?"" He looked genuinely offended. I gasped, shocked at hearing him say aloud the words I longed to hear but feared I never would. ""I didn't want to, but when you started apologizing, I thought for sure you regretted kissing me,"" I confessed, my voice breaking at the end. Edward took my face in his hands and looked at me with such sincerity that it startled me. ""I could never regret kissing you, Bella. But it wasn't right, me coming over here and demanding it from you like that. It's a pretty lousy excuse, but the alcohol made me a lot braver than perhaps it should have. I know I have gone about this in completely the wrong way, but I love you, and if you could give me a chance, I will make you happy. I promise."" By the time Edward came to the end of his declaration, I was close to tears, but I refused to let my emotions spoil this moment. ""You already do. Can't you see how happy you make me? How much these last few months have meant to me? Every day, I would look forward to seeing you, and every time, I dreaded you leaving. I love you, Edward,"" I admitted, swallowing my nerves. It had been a long time coming, but Edward was definitely worth the wait. That was ten years ago now. Edward and I were married less than a month later. Our first child, Charlie, arrived the following summer, quickly followed by our second son, Benjamin. Next came our twins, Elizabeth and Marie. The arrival of our fifth child, Samuel, made us a family of 7. Not that Edward was happy to settle. He would have quite happily had as many children as possible, but I was more than happy with the family we had. We worked hard, but life had been good to us. And I couldn't ask for any more than that. Please remember to leave the author some love!

196,4,31,4-Straight-thru-the-Heart-Fics-31.txt,twilight,StraightthrutheHeartFics,"to keep herself from crying out from the painfulness of the need she had for him. Was it love? Was it lust? The feelings she felt were too intense for it to be lust. It was more. She felt like she would lose her mind if she didn't get closer to him. She was seated in his lap, grinding against his hardness, yet she was not close enough. She needed to be closer. It scared her. She wanted to cry. Bella thrust herself forward, attacking his lips again. She traced his bottom lip with her tongue as she attacked his bronze hair with her hands. Their tongues twisted together in frantic urgency, and his hands slowly moved up her thighs. Her skirt had ridden up quite a bit from their activities. She pulled back to suck in a much needed breath, panting hard and heavy. ""I need…"" She tried to speak, but her hazy mind could barely form thoughts. She couldn't form the words, but he understood. He nimbly unbuttoned her blouse, roughly pulling it off and throwing it aside. ""You're beautiful,"" he said huskily as he unclasped her bra, letting it fall between them. For a moment, he just stared. She felt her skin heating up. She wanted to cover herself, but he held both her hands in a vise grip. He swiftly stood up with Bella in his arms, and her legs wrapped around his waist with her naked chest pressed against his clothed one. ""Down the hall, to the left,"" she breathed before connecting her lips to his neck. She would kiss him forever if she could. Once in her bedroom, Edward dropped her on the bed, unbuttoning his shirt and crawling toward her. His eyes were dark. ""You are perfect."" He threw his shirt aside. He covered her body with his, forcefully digging his fingers into her hips as their lips reconnected. She wrapped her legs around his waist, feeling his growing arousal. He slowly dragged his fingers up her sides, over her ribcage and to her breasts. He cupped them in his hands, lightly flicking her nipples with his thumbs. They stood firmly in response to his touch. He leaned down, sucking a pebbled nipple into his mouth. He released it with a loud pop, moving on to the other. His touch grew rough, and his kisses were filled with desperation. She knew he wanted her as much as she wanted him. Edward roughly pulled down her skirt. He seemed to be filled with impatience and primal need. Her back arched, and she felt the evidence of her arousal between her thighs. An involuntary whimper escaped her lips. She was desperate for him. He lowered his hips between her parted legs, gripping his cock and guiding it between her legs. He slowly pushed inside her, and she felt as if she could barely breathe. He gripped her hips, thrusting into her. Her back arched upward from the mattress, and her toes curled in utter bliss as she took in the full length of him. He was fully sheathed inside of her, and it felt like she was having the life sucked out of her. They seemed to be connected forever, but she never wanted to separate. She wanted to remain beneath him, with him inside her forever. Never separating. Never being apart. With every thrust, she let out short, desperate gasps. She clutched onto him, nails digging into his biceps, allowing the pleasure to overtake every part of her. She shut her eyes tightly as she cried out into the darkness, clenching around him. ""Perfect,"" he panted against her neck. She felt him throbbing as a strained groan emanated from his chest as he emptied himself inside of her. ""I've never done this before,"" she said breathlessly. One-night stands were definitely not her thing. In fact, she once frowned upon them. ""We haven't even been on a date."" ""This is not a one-time thing,"" he said firmly. ""I know."" ""And who said tonight wasn't a date?"" He moved off of her, lying back on the bed next to her, breathing heavily. ""Edward?"" ""Yeah?"" She couldn't bear the thought of ever being away from him. Her need was so great she thought she would burst into tears. ""Stay with me."" There was more to her words than seeking a promise of spending the night. ""I'm not going anywhere."" He understood her meaning. ""I think I'm in love with you,"" she whispered, staring at the ceiling. It felt freeing to say it. She felt as if the words would kill her if she didn't let them be known. A tear slipped from the corner of her eye. He propped himself up on his elbow. ""I'm going to marry you."" Her face lit up as her heart filled with happiness at his words. They were on the same wavelength. Even though she had just met him, she felt as if she had known him forever. ""I am going to marry you,"" he repeated. ""You're going to be my wife and the mother of my children one day. There is no doubt in my mind about that. I want to be tied to you in every possible way."" ""I want that more than anything. I have wanted it from the moment we met."" Before Edward walked into that conference room, Bella had no interest in marriage, dating, or even flirting. She did not stand a chance because her heart had already chosen Edward. Now that she had gotten a taste, there was no way she could stay away. Her life was about to change forever.

""I'm Dr. Cullen's girlfriend, and I promise, he has no reason to be calling you."" ""Wait, isn't Leah Clearwater your roommate?"" Emmett asks. ""One of them, why?"" ""That was me calling her,"" he emphasizes. ""Her mom was one of my patients in the ICU last week, and Leah's the medical power of attorney as well as next of kin,"" Emmett explains matter-of-factly, like he's suddenly the Neil Degrasse Tyson of logical conclusions and intelligent responses. ""Leah was on the floor with me some days and on others, she was out of the building, so I was always trying to track her down. She told me not to leave messages at home because of HIPAA. And the ICU is on the third floor."" ""Yeah, but your home number came up once, too,"" Kate says to me with another sneer. Emmett raises his hand. ""Me again, but that was a personal call to her."" ""What the fuck ever,"" she spits, flipping her hand in the air. ""Just make sure you lose my number, Edward."" Bella's chair scrapes along the floor before she stands eye to eye with Kate. ""Trust me, sweetie, it's lost."" Kate makes no move to leave, so Bella waggles her fingers in her face. ""Girl, bye."" Emmett beams at the potential catfight while I bite the insides of my cheeks, so fucking turned on, I don't know how I'm going to make it through the rest of the day without mounting this woman. ""C'mon."" Bella holds out her hand, and I leap up like I just got called down to Contestants' Row on The Price is Right. She threads her fingers through mine, and we brush past Kate while Bella practically drags me out of the cafeteria. ""Relax guys, I'll clean up!"" Emmett shouts after us. Bella pushes open the door to the women's locker room and into the private room where staff can make personal phone calls. She twists the lock after the door slams shut and lunges at me, pushing me back against the wall, but hell no. This isn't going down like this. I twist us around, pressing her back to the wall with fevered kisses. Nothing but lips, licks, sucks, and sighs. My teeth scrape down her neck, and I nuzzle my face into the sweet skin at the v-neck of her blue scrub top. Her hands grip at my hair, and it hurts one second and feels fucking phenomenal the next. My moans would be embarrassing if she weren't groaning in pleasure right along with me. I grab at her breast, while my thumb flicks at the pebbling nipple showing itself through her top. ""Edward, holy . . . holy shit,"" she gasps when my hand abandons her breast, and digs down into the front of her pants. I swipe the pads of my fingers across her panties, tapping at her clit. ""Let me get you off,"" I speak softly against her lips while I pull the soft fabric to the side and slip my fingers through her soaked lips. ""Yessss,"" she responds with a whisper and a whine. It's desire any way you slice it. My thumb finds her clit while my index and middle fingers graze through the wetness, entering her. I nibble and suck just below her ear, smiling every time she whimpers under my commanding touch. One of her hands relinquishes my hair and travels down my chest. My cock is so fucking hard, I've never felt the waist of my scrubs pull so tightly. She grips me through the material, and I almost lose the tempo I've started with her. I feel her twitch and tighten around my fingers, and my mouth moves back to hers because I can't get enough of her lips. ""Oh, god,"" she cries against my kiss. ""That's—I'm—"" She freezes in my arms, riding the wave of her release. Holding onto me for dear life, she slips her tongue back into my mouth. When she tugs on my hand, I pull it out before she stuns me by dropping to her knees, yanking down my pants and boxers in the process. Oh, holy mother, yes. She swallows most of my cock, and my head lolls back. ""Jesus."" I have to brace my hand against the wall, the sensation is so overwhelming. Watching her work me over is a beautiful sight. I run my fingers through her thick hair while her other hand grips my ass, turning me on more, if that's even possible. I swear I'm so lost in her movements as she strokes and sucks, there's no time to keep my cool before I'm at the brink. ""Fuck, Bella,"" I pant. ""I'm gonna come."" She pops off the edge of my dick, stands and starts jacking me until I'm shooting streams all over her lower stomach and panties. My head falls forward on her shoulder, and we chuckle for a few seconds. ""That was so fucking hot,"" I growl, licking at her pulse point and placing a soft kiss there. ""You're a mess now, though."" She winks, grabs a few tissues to clean her belly, and proceeds to peel off her panties, stuffing them in the pocket of my lab coat. I need to marry this girl. ""So, we're definitely on for Valentine's dinner tomorrow?"" I ask as we both readjust our scrubs, composing ourselves. She reaches up on her tip toes and pecks me on the lips before unlocking the door. ""Sure! I mean, what more could happen?"" Please remember to leave the author some love!

""You want to know what I think?"" Green eyes, pink lips, pale skin—my brain is overloading. ""You're used to being alone. You don't know how not to be."" ""You don't know me."" His brow arches and butterflies take flight in my stomach. ""I know you better than you think."" My jaw clenches as he closes the gap between us a little more. The memory of his kiss lingers, searing into my skin and making me ache for it again ""You're so used to looking after yourself that you're scared,"" he says. ""Scared of what being with someone would mean."" Goosebumps erupt as a single finger, soft and gentle, runs the length of my arm. ""You don't need to be afraid of me, Bella."" He cups my face in his palm, and instead of flinching, I feel my body relax. ""I'll never hurt you."" His gaze is intense. ""Let me in."" I've always relied on my gut instinct, and it's always, always been right. And my gut tells me Edward is true to his word. I feel it everywhere. He lowers his head, just a fraction, and I raise up onto my tiptoes. His hand slips to the back of my neck, fingers resting in my hair. As soon as his mouth touches mine, I know it. I knew it as soon as I saw him, beaten and vulnerable, and I know it now, here in this tiny cabin so many miles from anywhere of consequence. Here, with Edward, is exactly where I'm meant to be. He scoops me into his arms, and instead of the ass-kicking assassin I'm trained to be, I feel like a girl, cared for by a man. He carries me upstairs, kissing me gently every few steps. Clothes fall to the floor as Edward unhurriedly undresses me. I slip his T-shirt over his head, and he lowers us onto my unmade bed. He kisses me all over, exploring the spots that drive me crazy, causing my skin to heat and my heart to thunder. He takes his time, bringing me closer to the edge. He moves inside me and I move with him, waves of fire consuming us both. When he comes, he pins me with his gaze, and I've never felt more real, more grounded. It's enough to send me spiralling with him. All night we talk about our lives, our time here, everything, and nothing. We avoid what could come next. When we're done talking, we make love again and I feel myself falling for him. The morning is crisp and calm. I shake a pillowcase out and fold it over the clothesline. The radio plays somewhere inside, some French hip-hop station Edward found. I grin as I secure one of his t-shirts with a clothespin. I made eggs for breakfast—I ruined them, but Edward ate them anyway. He's started a woodpile close to the chalet. The days are starting to get shorter, and we'll need to set up for the winter if we're going to stay. I kind of want to. I think we could be happy together, him and me. We already are. ""Bella?"" I poke my head out from behind a sheet. ""Yeah?"" The only warning I get is the whistle of the missile before it hits the ground behind me. The shock wave rushes at me and I'm airborne for a moment before my body slams into the ground meters away. My ears ring as I roll onto my back, mentally cataloguing my body parts. ""Jesus, you're all right."" Edward appears above me, hands fluttering over me. ""Can you get up?"" When I don't answer right away, his tone is more urgent. Wincing, I lift my head. ""All limbs present and accounted for."" Even joking hurts. The earth tilts as Edward grabs my hand and pulls me to my feet. ""Good, because we need to run."" The reinforced gates hold them, but only for a moment. An arrow lodges into a tree with a thwack. Edward's breath catches, but he doesn't falter. ""Was that an arrow?"" I duck my head and push forward harder. ""Keep running!"" Edward steps on it, keeping up with me as we dart through the trees. ""Up here,"" he says between pants, as a low, wide machinery shed comes into view. ""I hope there's a fast car in there."" I miss my car. ""Better than that,"" Edward says, ducking as another bullet whizzes by. We hug the tree line as Edward reaches the doors, pushing them sideways. ""If that's what I think it is,"" I say, hope rushing through my body, ""you're totally getting lucky tonight."" Edward jumps into the cockpit and gives me the cheeky smirk I've come to love as he pulls on headphones. The airplane starts first go—finally, something is going our way. He reaches over, grabs my hand and kisses it. ""Let's get out of here."" He hits the thrust, and we're pushed back into our seats. The wheels leave the ground and we climb into the skies, leaving the chalet far below. Edward fiddles with a few knobs, grinning as he patches in the radio. He looks peaceful up here among the clouds, comfortable. ""Cygnet?"" Jasper sounds relieved. ""Am I glad to hear from you!"" ""Copy, Mockingbird. Target acquired,"" I say, smiling over at Edward. He smiles back, squeezing my hand. ""We're headed home."" As cheesy as it sounds, I guess you could say we fly off into the sunset and have our happily ever after. Almost.

He took a step toward me, and I instinctively stepped back. A smirk tugged at his lips as he watched my movement. He took another deliberate step forward, then another and another until he had me pressed against the wall. ""Bluebell,"" he murmured slowly, and his voice smoldered, so deep and just smooth velvet. ""You're the 1 to my 0, the copy to my paste, the x to my y, the oxygen to my air and the hydrogen to my water. You're the color bomb that makes my candy world explode, baby."" I couldn't help but giggle as his arms came up to encircle my waist. His thumbs skimmed over my waist as he spoke. ""In the past year, you've become such an important part of my life that I simply cannot imagine a day without you in it. Your beautiful smile, your voice, your laughter, your touch… they brighten my world. I've fallen in love with you, Bella, and I really want the chance to make you feel the same about me."" A single tear trailed down the slope of my cheek as Edward stared intently into my eyes. His soft, open, vulnerable expression tugged at my heart like nothing ever had. My hand rose of its own accord to brush away the furrow between his eyebrows and then frame his cheek. The spark of hope warring with nervousness in his features was like a mirror to my own heart, and something inside me clicked at the sight of it. ""Edward,"" I whispered and heard his breath hitch in response. I threaded my fingers through his hair, dragging whatever length of it was left to fall over his eyes in his signature way. I pulled off my glasses and placed them carefully on the bridge of his nose. He watched me warily as I did this, so I cupped his cheek again in reassurance. A wide smile split my face when I saw my Edward staring back at me. This was right. I could now say what I'd realized… what I'd already known, but suppressed due to my fear of losing my friend. Something inside me loosened, warmed, calmed at the prospects of what I was about to do. I could now admit the truth. ""I love you, too."" No sooner had the words left my mouth that Edward pulled me flush against his chest and pressed his mouth to mine. Our lips glided in perfect harmony as collective sighs of satisfaction left our mouths. Fingers grasped at hair and clothes, tongues reached out to stroke and rub, and groans slipped past our throats as we poured a year worth of feelings into a single kiss. ""You had me ever since you offered to be our vertebra,"" I told him breathlessly once we parted. We stayed close, though, hands entwined and foreheads pressed together. Edward laughed. ""Well, it would've been good to know that beforehand. I had to sit through hours of Tanya's torture to look this way."" I pecked the tip of his nose, reclaiming my glasses. ""Well, I love you this way and that. You can be whoever you want to be, Edward. That's what I want. Your tweed blazers and your floppy hair brighten my day. That was the Edward I fell in love with. Every day over the past year, you've been claiming little bits of me. Today, I give you the last, most precious part of me… the part that I guarded closely to keep myself from pain. Now, I've realized that I can't be truly happy until I set it free. My heart is yours, Edward."" He gave me an adoring smile, stroking the back of his hand over my flushed cheek. ""My heart is yours, too, my Bluebell. What you said… it was the same for me. I mean, you made quite an impression on me the first time we met."" ""Really? What impression was that – 'Anti-social Swan' showing her true colors?"" He shook his head in silent reproach. ""Why do you think I call you Bluebell? You were wearing a blue dress that night, remember? I dreamed of you just as you looked at the party for days after that. I couldn't think of anything but you after having spent only a few hours in your company."" Heat flooded through my cheeks at his sweet words, and at this point, I was sure I resembled a Tulip rather than a Bluebell. Edward chuckled at my reaction, planting a lingering kiss on my forehead. The gleam of laughter in his bright eyes was a sight to behold. It was a sight I wished to see often, and with that thought, I found myself making a request. ""I love your glasses,"" I told him, stroking the soft skin beneath his eyes. ""But maybe you could keep the contacts, too, and use them sometimes? You have such beautiful eyes, Edward."" ""All the better to see you with, my dear,"" he quipped and dodged my hand that reached out to smack him in response. ""Absolutely, baby. The contacts shall stay. Any other requests?"" I bit my lip, peeking up at him nervously before speaking. ""Take me on a date?"" Edward grinned and whooped a loud ""Yes!"" before picking me up in his arms and carrying my giggling form into what I was sure would be a new chapter of our lives.

I just…stick it in like that?"" Elrond realized what his problem was, the poor ner was sitting in a very odd position and the healer got a sly grin on his face. ""Well, first of all you remove your clothing and caress each other, kiss and cuddle until she is ready and then you can go ahead and do it"" Cauron whimpered. ""H…how do I know that she is ready?"" Elrond pointed at the drawing. ""When she gets slick and wet down there, now, have you understood?"" They stared at each other, wide eyed and both looked very embarrassed but also a bit determined. ""Well, yes, ah, what if we do something wrong?"" Elrond shook his head. ""You won't, believe me, once you get going it will be easy"" Cauron was crouched over even more than before. ""M…my lord, I…I feel…like that and…"" Elrond got up, a sort of devil had flown into him. There was a guest room next to the infirmary for people who had to stay and watch over someone injured and the bed was both freshly made and sturdy. ""Great, then you may follow me and if you like to try right now you can, I will be outside, in case you have questions."" Alassiel looked as if she was ready to pass out and then she got a determined pout on her face. ""If we do it now, how long will we have to wait for that elfling?"" The healer sighed, ""One year"" She took a deep breath. ""So the earlier we do it the earlier we will have a child of our own right?"" Elrond nodded and Alassiel took Cauron by the hand. ""Let's do it, I am not afraid"" Cauron was blushing and trembling and Elrond knew the drawings had had a very invigorating effect on the young male, he was probably painfully hard already. Elrond showed them to the room and they both entered, looking nervous. Cauron looked at him with pleading eyes. "" You promise you will stay here the whole time?"" Elrond nodded again and felt the need to laugh again but he didn't, oh Eru what a day. He patted Cauron on the back. ""Remember what I told you, undress, kiss and caress and then you can go for it"" Both nodded with determination written all over their faces and Elrond closed the door, his shoulders shaking with mirth. This was not the kind of jobs he had had while in Endor, that was for bloody sure. He stood by the door and heard the sound of someone throwing clothing onto the chairs, then a gasp from Alassiel and an outraged. ""Eru's mercy, is it supposed to be that big?!"" Cauron mumbled something and then there was the sound of kissing, a lot of it, and Elrond could hear that both had started to breathe rather heavily by now. He felt embarrassed having to listen to all sorts of whispered endearments and gasps and moans and then finally they had ended up in bed for he heard Cauron proclaim that she was wet, and Alassiel sort of whimpered and begged him for it and Elrond just knew it, these two would probably not stop until they had enough elflings to build a small army. Alassiel sort of squealed and he heard Cauron moan and grunt and the bed had started banging against the wall in a very lively rhythm. Nothing wrong with him for sure, he had figured it out just fine. Elrond felt himself blush, he could hear everything and Alassiel had suddenly discovered that this did feel good and she was very vocal about it too, and she had great lungs. Elrond stood there feeling like a moron as his assistant entered the room, the poor ner was staring with huge eyes. ""Morgoth's balls, what is going on?"" Elrond giggled. ""They didn't know that they needed to fuck to have kids, but now they do!"" The assistant just gaped and Elrond broke down into giggles and tears as they both heard Cauron roar something about the valar and their holiness and Alassiel was screaming from the top of her lungs. Cauron finished with a howl that would have made a warg green with envy and then the room fell silent. He heard a thin voice coming from behind the door ""Ah master healer? He…he passed out? Is that normal?!"" Elrond leaned against the wall, still shaking with mirth. ""Yes dear, he will come to again soon, and then you can continue if you like, as many times as you want to"" He could hear Alassiel sigh, she sounded very pleased. "" Oh that is great, I liked it. Thank you my lord"" Elrond had to leave before he started laughing out loud. ""You are welcome dear, and remember, don't listen to stupid advice"" He returned to his office, still chuckling. Well, at least that was one pair of very pleased patients and he had done something good this day too. He closed the office and returned home to Celebrian and she petted him and looked at him with her huge blue eyes, it was obvious that she understood that something was different than usual. ""Now dear, how was your day? You do look tired. "" Elrond fought the urge to burst into laughter again. "" Oh, you know, it has just been one of those days, cuts sores broken teeth and vanyar too blonde to fuck!"" Celebrian just stood there staring at him with a flabbergasted expression on her face while he hung up his outer robe. She would not rest now until she had been given the whole story and Elrond was pretty sure that before long his good wife would be rolling on the floor laughing. And that wasn't such a bad way to end the day at all."

The dwarves looked at each other, and some faces started to twitch, then some couldn't help themselves and started to chuckle and after a short while they too were laughing, really hard and very loudly. Dwarves do have a sort of rowdy humor and they were pointing at each other and admiring the different methods and patterns. Legolas grinned. "" I lost my comb in the pool, Aiwendil made it braid everything, can you get someone to get it for me?"" Thranduil stared at his son, it clicked! Aiwendil, of course it was the work of a wizard.

The dwarves stopped laughing, wiped tears of their face and Thranduil managed to speak again, even though his face was a bit red and he was trembling. After all, the sight was comical and he did have a sense of humor even though most people could have sworn that he didn't even know what that word meant. "" I do apologize, most sincerely! It appears that a certain wizard has done something he shouldn't have! I will see if I can make him undo this magic, right away!"" Legolas still giggled and the dwarves stared at his braided head and had to laugh too. "" Oh, no real harm done, and wouldn't you say lads, that we have gotten some new fashion ideas too? I bet yer wife would love those braids down there Golin?"" Said dwarf just guffawed, he had three thick brown braids hanging down alongside his cock and it made his crotch look a bit like an udder of some sorts. "" But mind you, she may grasp the wrong thing in the dark."" They all laughed again and Thranduil sent one of the advisors to get Aiwendil and explain the situation. The wizard came running after a short while, robes flying behind him and a distinct scent of fox pee filled the room. Aiwendil stopped and stared with huge eyes for a few seconds, then he too succumbed to a wild fit of laughter and in the end he was laying on the ground writhing. Thranduil sent him a deathly glare. "" When you are finished soiling my floors then could you perhaps out of the goodness of your heart undo that magic? Or else I will kick you into that pool myself, robes and all!"" Aiwendil did shut up, then he blinked twice and got up, shaking his head. "" Oh, but I can only remove the magic from the comb, so it won't happen again. The braids will have to come out the ordinary way"" Thranduil rolled his eyes and sighed, he would have to spend hours unbraiding Legolas. And the dwarves? Oh Eru and all his valar, that would be a monumental task. He took a deep breath. "" Then do it, get that magic out of the pool, and if I catch you giving away magical stuff one more time I will make sure you spend the next millennia in my dungeons!"" Aiwendil squeaked something which could be an apology, then he shouted something in valarin and shrugged. ""It is done!"" The dwarves looked a bit nervous. "" How about our braids aye?"" Thranduil was thinking fast. ""We do sometimes have human visitors, I bet there has to be a razor here somewhere"" The dwarves groaned but by now they had understood the situation and they couldn't really bear a grudge against the sweet little elfling. It had been an accident after all, and really nobody's fault. Thranduil sent some servants for razors and they came back with a few and the dwarves retired to the baths to try and remove the braids. In the end most had to shave their bodies for the hairs were hopelessly entangled and they even had to shave their asses and came out of the baths smooth as newborn babies. Only their beards and hair was saved from the razors, and of course their eyebrows except in one case where the eyebrows had been joined to the hair on the poor dwarf's chest in a very long thin braid. Thranduil did spend the rest of the day fixing his son's hair and getting some rather awkward questions he preferred not to answer, and when Legolas fell asleep sitting on his lap he sighed and knew he had learned yet another thing about parenting he hadn't known before. Never mix elflings and wizards like Aiwendil, it is a recipe for disaster. Things returned to normal, and Aiwendil left but three days later the cook came running looking as if he had spotted Morgoth himself in the larder. The sausages hanging in the back of the room had been braided during the night and it soon became apparent that somebody had taken water from the pool at night before the wizard removed the magic and it had gotten spread throughout the pipes and water storages since they used that pool as an extra water source when it hadn't rained in a while, and nobody had used it for bathing. So for the next few days things that got washed ended up being braided, elves taking a drink of water risked waking up with their hair being braided into the bedding and when the king himself woke up one morning with his long silvery blond hair braided into the headboard of his bed he ordered that the entire system of pipes, cisterns and drains were to be completely flushed and washed. He didn't want any of this to happen again, the only good thing was that he got to spend the entire day in bed with his son while the servants tried to untangle his hair from the bed. So at least one good thing came out of the whole beardy business."
202,2,27,2-Nuredhel-27.txt,lord-of-the-rings,Nuredhel,"he felt something hard, something which absolutely should not have been there. It appeared to be lodged in her cervix and the healer already knew what this was, and why. He sighed and used some instruments to remove the object, she immediately started to bleed and he feared that the blood loss would be too much for her, but then again, he didn't want her to die with that thing still stuck inside of her. Teren was staring at him with huge eyes as he pulled the thing forth and the elf just turned on his heel and left the room with a choked cough. Ringariel swallowed and turned grey but she remained there and Poicano worked for over an hour to remove all the puss and flush her with herbal extracts which could help her fight the terrible infection. Poicano felt sick, numb even. It was just so awful, beyond anything he ever had experienced. How could creatures treat others like this? When he had done all that he could he made sure that she was placed in a good bed and that someone would be watching over her the whole time. He did not think that she had much of a chance but at least they had tried. Nobody else had tried to save her, it was rather obvious. Had those humans understood how ill she was? Had they just pretended like nothing, tried to make as much money on her as possible before she died? The idea made him too red hot with anger, he would have done exactly what the king did if he was in his shoes. A beheading was a far too swift and gentle punishment, the men should have been flogged. He went to the throne room and found Thranduil sitting on his throne with a goblet of wine in his hands and a very sinister expression on his fair face. He looked as if he was ready to get up and slice a whole army into dice sized pieces and Poicano sighed and bowed. He knew that their king appeared to be both cold and arrogant but it was a façade, he did care a lot about others, he just could not let everybody see it. He turned his ice blue gaze towards Poicano who felt a little insecure, how much did the king really need to know? He was the king, the healer did not want to keep any secrets from him, it never worked in the long run. Thranduil put down the goblet and sighed. "" So, how bad is it?"" Poicano shrugged. "" Bad, I cannot lie. I do not really think that she will survive but since she is still alive she might have a tiny chance. I did find the source of the infection which is killing her"" He pulled the metal object out of his pocket, it had been cleaned and Thranduil stared at it with a confused expression on his face. "" Is that a crochet needle? What does that have to do with anything?"" Poicano looked down. "" I found it in her"" The king frowned. "" Had someone stabbed her with a crochet needle?!"" The healer sighed heavily, to an elf such actions were unheard of, no wonder why Thranduil didn't understand. "" No, in her, as in her…you know… female area?"" The king just stared at him for a moment in confusion, then it dawned on him and he turned slightly green, Poicano looked around for any buckets or other objects useful if the king needed it. "" My king, are you ok? Do you need a bucket?"" Thranduil shook his head, tossed down a huge gulp of wine and coughed violently before he turned to the healer once more, teary eyed. "" Why? Why would anyone do that?"" Poicano sat down on the stairs below the throne. "" I am pretty sure I know why, the thing that man said explained it. If the people who had her sold her as a whore to other men she probably got pregnant. And they tried to end her pregnancy by causing a miscarriage. "" Thranduil moaned. "" Valar, this is the stuff of nightmares, no worse. Those humans must have been the spawn of Morgoth himself!"" Poicano was having a very sad expression in his eyes. "" The evil of the world can come in many forms, some worse than others. I guess this is one of them."" The king sighed. "" Do you think she can tell us anything if she survives?"" Poicano made a grimace. "" Maybe, but that is not our main concern, first of all we have to make sure that she does live, and that she is free from pain and discomfort. She has probably never been treated with kindness her whole life, she will most likely see us as enemies until we can prove to her that we mean her no harm. It will be a long process my lord, long and I bet painful too."" Thranduil nodded, his eyes were dark. "" You are probably right, I have no idea of what or who she is, she must be some sort of elf and that makes her kin, and she is barely more than a child. The very idea of someone of our race being treated like that makes my blood boil with anger, I am not sure that I can contain it."" Poicano sent the king a sad smile. "" Then let someone else do the talking, at least in the beginning. She may sense your rage and believe that she is the cause of it and its target."" Thranduil shook his head, he had a pained expression on his face. "" I would never feel anger towards her, that poor poor child, why have the gods allowed such a young creature to suffer thus? It breaks my heart. "" Poicano could only sigh. "" As it does mine my lord, as it does mine."""
203,2,12,2-Nuredhel-12.txt,lord-of-the-rings,Nuredhel,"any more. This was terrible! Aravan let out a hoarse roar and Galion could hear the servant heaving for breath, sobbing in pain. Galion wanted to rush into the room, wanted to kill Aravan there and then but he couldn't, he didn't have any weapons and if he did call for the guards to arrest the culprit Aravan would most likely get away with it since he was an envoy from Imladris. Aravan put his pants back on, he was smirking, smacked the young elf's ass hard. "" Now, that wasn't too bad now was it? At least you know what it feels like to get some real cock, you ought to be proud of having lost your virginity to someone so far above you."" Galion had a hard time breathing, he saw that the servant was barely able to stand and tears were streaming down his face. Aravan was leaning forth, almost caressing the young elf. "" If you mention of this to anyone I will not hesitate to tell that boss of yours that you have stolen from the kitchen."" The servant just whimpered and Galion frowned, had the servant been stealing? Nothing was missing and he didn't understand at all. The servant whimpered. "" Please, it was just a couple of oranges for my little sister…"" Aravan sneered. "" Still it is theft now isn't it, you will lose your job."" Galion had heard enough, what a complete asshole, he was using the fact that the other elf was young and naïve and a few oranges? The servants could take and eat all they wanted from the fruit as long as there was enough left for the feasts. Galion slipped in behind a door and watched how Aravan walked by, looking very smug and pleased with himself. The normally gentle butler would have strangled the bastard if he could. But this was a job for the king, he was to find the punishment for such actions. After a few minutes the servant emerged, limping and pale and his eyes were black and enormous within the young face. Galion slipped out from behind the door and the young elf squeaked and he almost fainted. "" Oh Eru, you saw?!"" Galion grasped onto the trembling ellon and held him tight. "" I did but worry not, you will not lose your job mellon, you are safe. I will make sure that Aravan never hurts another elf, I swear!"" The young ellon almost collapsed. "" I didn't want to, I didn't want to, I swear. He forced me, it was horrible, oh Eru it hurt"" Galion held him gently, feeling how the anger within him made his seethe. "" I know, ssshh, you are safe now. I will take you to the healers now, they will help you. That bastard has harmed you I fear."" The servant just sobbed and Galion knew that some elves do fade from such horrible actions, he hoped that this young one would survive without a broken soul. He hurried carrying the wounded ellon to the healing ward and he used some hidden corridors only he knew of. The servant was too distraught to even notice where he was, constantly wailing and sobbing and trembling. He rushed in through the doors and the head of the healers stared in disbelief at the butler who carried a youth in his arms. "" Hurry, close the doors and let nobody enter. This will not leave this room but send someone to notify the king and ask him to get here soon. But let nobody know why."" The healer came over and Galion put the servant down onto a bed very carefully. "" What in the name of the one has happened to him? An accident in the kitchen?"" Galion snorted. "" No, he has been raped! By that sorry excuse for an elf out of Imladris, I bet he is torn up on the inside, as far as I could see the bastard didn't use any sort of lube."" The healer gasped and snapped into action, getting more healers over and they gave the servant something that made him fall asleep. Galion sat down on a chair, feeling truly shaken. What sort of a monster was really that ellon? No elf would hurt another like that? Was Aravan truly mad? Drunk with power perhaps? As the healers were working there was the sound of running feet and the king came rushing into the rooms, he looked confused and Galion jumped up onto his feet to greet him. "" What is going on, you look as though you have seen a ghost?!"" Galion swallowed, he felt a bit faint still. "" I have seen something so terrible I have a hard time believing it. Aravan has raped a young servant, the healers are working on him right now!"" The king went silent, then he went pale and suddenly his eyes were shooting lightning and he seemed to be aglow with rage. "" WHAT?! Are you serious?"" Galion looked down. "" I am sorry, yes, I am. I saw it with my own eyes."" Thranduil sneered. ""Then by Morgoth's rotten teeth, he will pay, he will pay dearly for this!"" Galion nodded. ""Yes my lord, do you want to take him to court?"" Thranduil almost growled. "" No, he will find a way to talk himself out of it, I am bloody sure. And a trial means that the poor victim will have to testify and I do not want to put anyone so traumatized through something like that, it will just renew the memories. No, I will deal with this, the only way possible. An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth!"" Galion watched his king's expression and couldn't help but shudder, this didn't look good at all for Aravan, no it did look as though the ellon soon would come face to face with a true force of nature, namely the elven king of Greenwood!"
204,2,14,2-Nuredhel-14.txt,lord-of-the-rings,Nuredhel,"Thranduil found mice gnawing at his favorite robes, some had destroyed his crown since they were eying the berries attached to the thin branches and when he lifted the lid of a bowl of stew to have dinner he found not food but three stuffed mice. Legolas was at first thrilled, he had gotten his pets back! Then he got confused for these mice didn't want him to pet them, one of them actually bit him when he tried to pick it up and there were just too many of them. It wasn't cute anymore, it was frightening. The mice looked like small ghosts and the sounds they made were scary too, a high pitched squealing that hurt the sensitive elven ears. And the smell! The entire palace soon reeked of mouse and Thranduil was aghast when he tried to get to bed and found five litters of mice, freshly born, underneath his covers. He started to fear that the goddamn mice would manage to do what the orcs hadn't, force them to abandon their home. The horses were getting skittish due to the mice scurrying around their legs, the hens stopped laying and the dogs tried to kill mice but the small rascals were too many and too swift. The elves were in despair. The mice did what all living creatures do, they defecate and everything was covered with droppings. The healers were fuming because of the lack of hygiene in the healing ward and many got sick to their stomach because of the contaminations. They had to get water from outside of the palace and Thranduil ordered half of the army to go mouse hunting. He armed the warriors with clubs and it became one bloody and terrible mess but there was no end to the mice. They just kept coming and the elves tried to exterminate them by going through the entire palace room after room but to no prevail. There were too many crevices and cracks in the rock in which the mice could hide. Then one evening Aiwendil the brown wizard arrived. Thranduil had sent a message to him and the wizard had never heard of anything like that before. The infestation was horrible, traps, poison or dogs didn't change anything, they were too many. Ithil and Anor had indeed followed the scripture and become plentiful and they obviously had managed to transfer their fertility and libido to all of their descendants. The elves had tried to remove everything edible to starve the mice but not even that had worked, and now the mice became desperate and got aggressive. Some elflings had gotten bitten and a babe had been attacked while in the crib and got badly hurt so they had to do something and they had to do it fast. Aiwendil was in shock, he had never witnessed anything like that and he was at first a bit scared that he wouldn't be able to do anything about this menace, then he got an idea. He had one of the carpenters summoned to his chamber and gave the man some very strict instructions. The morning after the wizard went into the courtyard and with him he brought a flute. It didn't look much like other musical instruments though, it wasn't straight but bent and it looked more like a branch than a flute but it had holes in it and the weird looking wizard started playing it. The sound was awful, it sounded as if some tiny thing was being tortured in the moist horrific ways and the elves had to plug their ears but to the mice this was obviously the equivalent of a lovely aria. They gathered around the wizard and it looked like a river of white bodies. The elves stood there awestruck as the wizard started to walk out of the palace and the mice followed him, like they were tied to him by a leash. A sea of white came after the wizard and Thranduil waved him goodbye and thought good riddance. He had given the ishtari clear instructions regarding where he was to go with these pests. Soon there were just a few mice left and they were not such a great problem. Thranduil grasped two of his guards, gave them a pouch of gold and the order to go and buy as many cats as possible and they gladly obeyed. The king had just said cats, it didn't matter what sort of cats it was as long as they caught mice, tomcats, bobcats, whatever. So they returned with everything from skinny feral creatures who hissed and spat even at elves to groomed and shiny ones with a pedigree and all. And the reign of mice thus ended and peace was restored to the realm, or perhaps not. A few months later they did notice that the orc no longer attacked so often and the groups were smaller, the forces of Dol Guldur were obviously occupied doing something else than fighting the elves. Rumors said that there was some sort of infestation problem and that the orcs all stayed near the privies due to diarrhea and vomiting. And many a spider's nest were found completely ruined by rodents, not a single egg was left alive. Legolas got a cat of his own, he named it Sassy and it spent every night in his room and he was very fond of it. One morning when Thranduil came to bid his son good morning he was met with a beaming Legolas and a very proud and protective mother with six little ones. ""Look Ada, I have gotten kittens!"" Thranduil had to turn around, do a facepalm and send a short prayer to Eru. ""Dear lord, not again!"" But cats do after all not breed quite as fast as mice and they were both needed and useful and so the cats stayed. And even Thranduil found it soothing to sit there on his throne with a purring feline on his lap."
205,2,21,2-Nuredhel-21.txt,lord-of-the-rings,Nuredhel,""" He took a deep breath, she was able to see the errors of her ways now, that was quite a relief and he started to hope that she perhaps could become normal now, that there was hope for her soul after all. He sighed. ""Yes, you are, there is no denying it. You have crossed the line one time too many."" She shuddered and looked away, tears visible in those dark eyes once more. ""I know my lord, I am a monster."" He took a deep breath, it sounded like a gasp. ""Oh Eru's mercy, no, don't say that. You are no monster Barah."" She sobbed. ""I am, they are right you know, I know only hatred, only fear. They say I cannot feel anything but that is a lie because I feel fear, all the time. I fear everything, even life itself."" He stared at her, stunned by this moment of insight. She let out a wailing sound, threw herself forward and laid there in front of him, shivering. ""Please, save me. Teach me to feel something else than fear, free me from who I am and show me who to be instead."" He was in shock, the stay in the dungeon had apparently pushed her a bit too far, made her cross a threshold she otherwise never would have reached. She was able to see the errors of her ways now and still she was afraid she would return to her old habits, he did understand her rather well. He caressed her hand. ""Alright, if that is what you truly wish for?"" She whimpered. ""Yes my lord, I am yours to command."" He did in that moment realize that what she needed was to be dominated, to be told what to do with no other option than to obey. She had been like a horse with the bit between its teeth running wild and she had run herself straight into danger without thinking about it at all. She needed a strong leader, someone she could trust and who allowed her to drop her guard and surrender. He knew she had been like a spoilt child in some ways, constantly pushing the boundaries in an attempt to create a reaction, to find the safety of someone strong enough to control her. She never had, they had looked at the problem from the wrong direction the whole time. She needed safety first and foremost, not challenges and danger. He got up and smiled to her. ""I am glad you finally have realized where you erred. Yes, you shall serve me but the way I decide and when I decide. First of all, you need to get well again, until then my order is for you to rest and for your wounds to heal."" She stared at her wrists and hands, frowned. ""When did I get those?"" He sighed. ""You bit yourself and tried to dig your way out of the cell, that's how you got them. Now, rest for a few days, when I think you are ready we can finish your punishment."" She stared at her wrist with a shivering chin and she slowly wrapped her blankets around herself again, her eyes distant and scared. She did not remember, why didn't she remember? Her fingernails were worn completely down, the tips of her fingers torn and aching and her wrists hurt too. Had she really done that to herself? Tried to kill herself by biting over her wrists, like an animal caught in a foot snare? She sighed and leaned back against the pillows, her mind a maelstrom of emotions, it was as though a huge dam had been ripped open and now the feelings it had contained were running free. She could no longer control them and she remembered her previous state of mind, of being in constant fear. She had not been alive, that was the grim truth. She had been caught in a never ending nightmare and she had been unable to find the strength to break out of it. Hatred and fear is two sides of the same thing and the fury with which she had been fighting had been her desperate attempt to escape both. She had been so wrong, had done so many bad things she was shocked that she still was alive. Her own kin would have rid themselves of her had she been a little older, it was no doubt about it. You didn't disobey your officers without consequences. She deserved to be punished, severely. She could never be free from her guilt until she was. She sat there, staring down at the blankets and she felt that this luxury was something she didn't deserve at all. They were too kind to her. It made her even more ashamed of herself. Thranduil nodded at her. ""Rest now, I will make sure that you have all the food you need and the healers will check in on you every now and then. When you are well we can discuss what to do with you."" He saw her nod, the sad expression on her face didn't disappear at all and he gestured towards a servant. ""Make sure she has food and keep the room warm. Also, arrange for her to get a bath as soon as the healers say it's okay. She needs it."" The healers had washed her but it had only removed the worst of the grime and she did still smell rather bad. He hadn't thought of that until now and had to grin, she did distract him. But there would be some days before she got completely healed and that gave him time to decide what to do with her. She probably expected him to take advantage of her will to surrender to him but he didn't want to use her thus. He was starting to get an idea of what to do but it was too early yet to be sure if it would work or not."
206,2,9,2-Nuredhel-9.txt,lord-of-the-rings,Nuredhel,"""Ah they were rather…vigorous!"" Glorfindel gasped. ""They? THEY?! Don't tell me that you have been in a freaking orgy?!"" Lindir looked down, his cheeks were burning like crazy and he had to smile, he could not help it remembering it all. ""Well, as a matter of fact, yes, I guess you could call it that, I just met these three ellith and…"" Glorfindel shook his head in disbelief. ""Three ellith at the same time, by the Valar Lindir, I would never have imagined that you'd ever dare touch an elleth. And now you have been banging three in one afternoon?! Talk about hidden talents!"" The minstrel had a rather sheepish expression on his face. ""It was kind of nice, once I got used to it I mean, and they liked it too."" Glorfindel coughed, he still shook his head in confusion. ""Well, if you managed to satisfy three ellith like that then I am bowing to you my friend. Forget everything I have ever said about you being a coward for not wielding a sword, I see now that the kind of sword you were made to wield is quite the different type. You were probably born to fight you're battles in the bedroom."" Lindir grinned, the golden warrior still looked shocked, he probably would have looked more at ease if a balrog dressed in a light blue tutu started dancing the cancan right in front of him wielding a conductors staff. He looked down at his fingernails with a satisfied smirk. ""They did call me quite a stud."" Glorfindel sighed. ""Damn, I am telling you Lindir, if the ellith find out about this then first of all the rest of us will end up being utterly ignored and second of all, you will be as sought after as a jar of honey in a pen filled with bears. The ellith will be swarming around you lad"" Lindir got a peculiar expression on his face, it looked as if the idea actually tempted him a bit. Glorfindel grimaced. Those three ellith whoever they were had apparently created a monster, and he was afraid that he from now on would have to put up quite an effort in order to get the female attention he wanted and needed. Having Lindir as a rival? That idea had never crossed his mind before but now it was rather obvious that the shy and timid minstrel had found a new hobby and that he would pursue it rather eagerly. Glorfindel swore to himself that he never would tell anyone of this, maybe Lindir would keep his mouth shut so things could remain as they were but no, his hopes were crushed. It wasn't before long that they noticed that Lindir suddenly became extremely popular among the ellith, Glorfindel heard one mention that he was really good at teaching her how to ""sing"" and that he had ""a very sweet tongue"". The other Ellyn were almost ignored and started to get a bit grumpy since Lindir got the attention of all the young single ellith there. They said that the guards saw females sneaking out of his home almost every morning. Glorfindel could not believe that the Valar were so unjust towards the rest of them, he tried to charm the ladies like before but now they treated him and the other warriors like they were just not that very interesting at all. He was in fact getting rather annoyed, he had been the favorite of the ellith of Imladris and now he, the golden warrior, had to fight for their attention against none other than Lindir!? Heck, the ellon had been renowned for having almost passed out once when he accidentally caught sight of an elleth's nipple! And now he was more busy getting laid than a bunny during the mating season? The gods had become mad for sure. Months passed and winter came and went and summer came once more. The situation was pretty much as it had been and Lindir was really enjoying the admiration of the females, he was starting to get very cocky and a bit too haughty and Glorfindel just wished that he could give that annoying minstrel a small lesson in how to behave, it wasn't fair that he got all the girls! Then one day Glorfindel and the other Ellyn got the break they had been praying for. A letter arrived and it was for Lindir. Glorfindel happened to be there when the minstrel received the letter and he saw Lindir read it. The minstrel looked a bit puzzled. ""Hmm, it's from the three girls I met last summer, they have got a surprise for me they say, one from each of them. They want me to visit them, I wonder what that might mean, three surprises?"" Glorfindel had to turn around to hide the wide grin he knew was rather telling of his emotions, what goes around comes around and now Lindir would have to pay, and he bet continue paying too. The golden warrior was laughing so hard he had problems breathing. Two days later a very pale and obviously shocked Lindir returned to Imladris and he immediately started looking for jobs, mumbling something about ""child-support"" ""Lawyer"" and ""bankruptcy"". The other Ellyn got the ellith to themselves once more and from now on the minstrel stayed clear of both ellith and ponds and if some eager young thing tried to sweet talk him into something he would just turn and run for his very life as if he suddenly had a pack of orcs at his heels. Things were thus back to how they had been and everybody was grateful for that expect perhaps poor Lindir who now had to learn that every deed done has its effect and for the next century he would have to pay the price for that one wonderful evening in the woods. Needless to say most of his songs from that moment on could best be described as ""Blues""."
207,2,32,2-Nuredhel-32.txt,lord-of-the-rings,Nuredhel,"since he didn't have that much of the almond oil and the other ingredients needed so the cream was reserved for the private parts and only there. It did work, but it did sting and Glorfindel grasped a bucket of ice water someone had found in case someone got burned by the wax and sat down in it, hissing with relief. By now he was hairless once more and the other Ellyn there stood there staring with huge eyes and terror written all over their faces. Erestor scoffed. ""Come on guys, don't be wimps, show us that you do have some balls after all"" Some Ellyn came forth, got some wax and cream and bandages and sauntered off with a friend or two, looking as if they were heading for their own execution. Oh Eru, there would be many sore butts over the next days, Elrond would probably have to gather all the pillows available for the benches they used in the halls. The Ellyn scattered to help each other and now the valley did resound with even more screams and curses, it sounded as if a battle was taking place and if someone had entered unknowing of this bizarre situation they would immediately believe that the elves were being attacked by some absolutely horrible new creation of Morgoth. Elrond was gathering as much skin cream as he could find, it would be needed and he was about to ask Erestor if he could do the honours and help him getting rid of the hair when Thranduil did step forth. He looked slightly embarrassed and Elrond did make a sigh. Of course, that too! The elven king managed to look calm. ""Elrond, I…I would like for you to give me a hand?"" Elrond nodded. ""Alright, but you do have servants?"" Thranduil made a grimace. ""I do, but…they are servants! I never undress in front of my servants, not even my butler"" Elrond should have guessed that, he shrugged. ""Here, or some private room?"" Thranduil did look sheepish. ""A private room please?"" Elrond took a deep breath. ""Great, follow me"" Thranduil did follow, and he gathered a wine bottle from a servant and started drinking on the way, Elrond realized that the tall sinda was very nervous indeed. There were a few rooms with lockable doors there and Elrond turned around and smiled at the king. "" Alright, you may strip down now"" Thranduil swallowed and started to unbutton his robes, the healer was a bit shocked to see that the sinda had escaped most of the malady, he had chest hair and some on his back apparently but not that much elsewhere. Elrond found some scissors and a razor and went to work on the beard, that actually made him feel a bit sad for incredibly enough Thranduil's beard did look good on him. When that was done it was time for the rest of the hairs and Elrond had to admire the perfect physique. Thranduil was a gorgeous specimen and the hair didn't actually mar his beauty at all, it just made it look more exotic. Elrond did wax the king's chest and he was surprised that Thranduil didn't even moan as he yanked the hairs out. He was indeed tough as the hills themselves. The last part of the royal anatomy to be waxed was in fact the royal butt and Elrond had to pinch his own arm to believe this, who would have thought that he one day would have to remove hair from the ass of one of the Mirkwood royals. Thranduil hadn't even whimpered and Elrond was impressed by the king's stamina and resistance against pain. Thranduil got smeared with some numbing skin cream and then he redressed himself. ""Thank you, now I can return home safely. What do you think caused this? Some spell?"" Elrond managed to smile. ""Ah, most likely yes, Radagast did visit us some time ago, it could be one of his spells gone wrong."" Thranduil shrugged. ""Doesn't surprise me, that maia has got mushroom stew for a brain"" Elrond just prayed that Thranduil never learned the truth about this incident, he would hate dwarves even more vividly if he found out that a dwarf was the cause of this. Elrond had Erestor helping him with his own hairs and he did suddenly remember some curses he had heard Maedhros utter once when he had dropped something due to his handicap, they were inventive and juicy and Maglor had washed his mouth with soap when he heard the young ellon repeat them. But the skin cream did help against the soreness and some of the elves did in fact leave their head hair the way it was. Suddenly the elves making hair pins and ornaments got a lot to do. Then one day Elrond discovered that someone had copied the recipe for the hair growth ointment and he feared the worst. His sons would return from their patrols as usual but now they somehow did come across way better information than before, somehow the orcs they captured were more talkative than ever before. Elrond got a strong suspicion and it was confirmed the year after when he followed the twins on a patrol. Elrohir and Elladan had in fact made some of the ointment and rubbed the captured orcs with it, when the orc was covered with so much hair it resembled a bear they would add wax and yank the hairs out and after just a few strips being pulled out the orcs usually told them absolutely everything they needed to know. Elrond didn't really appreciate the use of torture but at least the recipe did come in handy after all, and the information they gathered was very valuable and helped saving lives. And Elrond could proudly address himself as the ""royal butt waxer"" knowing that he was one of the very few living beings who could brag about having seen the haughty king of Mirkwood in his birthday suit."
208,2,31,2-Nuredhel-31.txt,lord-of-the-rings,Nuredhel,"panic attacks and run off, but they got fewer and fewer. Lindir would often sleep in a couch, leaned up against Elrond and the healer had to admit that he was very fond of the minstrel. The trust he showed was very endearing and he had always liked the beautiful young ellon. He just doubted that Lindir ever would want to become intimate with anyone again. He was just so very damaged by the horrible experience. Then he started having nightmares and Elrond tried to avoid giving him sleeping medicine, knowing that he had a problem with addiction. Instead he would let Lindir sleep with him in his own bed, it was more than large enough for two and for some reason the minstrel never had nightmares there. He would cuddle up against the lord like a puppy and sleep like a child and Elrond found it truly endearing. It was like that for some short years, then it was obvious that Lindir's body had overcome the trauma and Elrond did notice that the young elf sometimes would writhe in his sleep, moaning softly and being visibly aroused. He did never awaken though, and he just laid there. Elrond didn't say anything and he didn't touch Lindir in any manner. Then one night Lindir did awaken, and he was mortified. He curled up in a ball, too ashamed to speak even and Elrond had to ensure him of his worth once again, telling him nothing was wrong with him, that it was natural, and not a shame. Lindir did calm down and he did go back to sleep too. Elrond was so relieved, there was hope still. Most times Elrond would just turn around and ignore it when Lindir had that sort of dreams, or woke up aroused. But one night he did wake up with Lindir pressed up against his own body and the young elf was more or less rubbing himself against his bed partner, moaning. Elrond had reacted too, it was rather hard not to and Lindir woke up with a start and was so shocked he just laid there trembling. Elrond realized that nothing he said would comfort the minstrel so he decided that action spoke deeper than words. He grasped onto the shivering ellon and pulled them closer to each other, whispering soft soothing words, reassuring Lindir that it was alright, that he didn't mind, that he too had needs and wants. Lindir just whimpered, but started moving again, his crotch sliding against Elrond's and the healer kissed the minstrel gently and reached down, grasped onto them both and brought them to a rather shaky and unexpected climax. Lindir almost screamed when he came, still afraid of his own feelings and so insecure and scared. Elrond just held him through it, whispering gently, encouraging him. The minstrel almost passed out but the fact that Elrond too had his pleasure sort of convinced him that yes, it was alright. Lindir wept with relief afterwards, and he admitted that it was way better than doing it alone, even when he was watching someone. Elrond knew that he by doing this had taken it a step further, they weren't just friends anymore but lovers and he swore that he would take care of Lindir and never betray the trust the young minstrel showed him. In the weeks following they dared to go a little further and Elrond let Lindir set the pace, he never pushed the younger elf into anything, he did make small suggestions but Lindir was the one to decide whether or not they would do it. He loved to show Lindir that his body still was capable of creating great joy, that it wasn't filthy or soiled in any manner. That he was desirable and beautiful. Lindir flourished once more, the shadows were still there, hiding in his mind but they didn't have the power to ruin him anymore. About a year later Elrond was convinced that Lindir was healed enough to take it one step further, and that night they did make love for real. He let the young elf top him first, just to show him that it was alright and that he trusted him. Lindir wasn't afraid at all when Elrond took him, just a wee bit nervous but Elrond was very gentle and careful and he made sure that Lindir was well prepared and that he felt only pleasure. When the minstrel came screaming Elrond's name he just knew that it was over, it was behind them now, Lindir had overcome the horror and his fëa had escaped unscathed. It was a miracle and one that made Elrond feel very humble. Everybody knew that the two of them was a couple now and Elrond wept the night Lindir told him that he loved him, and had for years. He confessed that he shared the same feelings and that night they spoke their vows and swore to stay together. Elrond was still married to Celebrian but he knew that she would accept Lindir the day they left middle earth, her heart was large enough for two and if the valar did protest well then screw them. The heart is a palace with an infinite number of rooms and Elrond would never regret marrying Lindir. The minstrel became more lovely than ever before, the knowledge that he was safe and loved made him practically radiant and Elrond was so very proud of him. He got his voice back and the years to come he became rather famous and sought after and Elrond had to think that Aerion in one way almost had to be thanked for their newfound love and happiness, but only almost! And Lindir never again needed to sneak down to the river at night, Elrond made sure that he was content and satisfied in every possible manner and so his unfortunate addiction became a thing of the past, barely remembered and never again mentioned, just the way it should be."
209,2,0,2-Nuredhel-0.txt,lord-of-the-rings,Nuredhel,"still wrapped around him while he sat almost upright. It had always been a position he enjoyed and he leaned forth and squeezed her nipples with two fingers and were rewarded with a loud yell, she had closed her eyes and her face was contorted in ecstasy, a gentle flick of a finger at the top of her slit and she came again, screaming like mad. Oh he loved the squealers, they were the best. At least he could be darn sure she enjoyed it fully and he allowed himself to be just as loud. It was all a part of the plan. Could he make the two guards come just from watching this? It had become a challenge and one he intended to finish with a success as a result. The bench was threatening to fall apart, Candriel was moaning and groaning and he made her come again and again and he was amazed by her sheer endurance. She was truly a gem and he thought that he would make sure that she was available whenever he needed more of this. They changed their positions again and he had a crooked grin on his face, the first guard had stood there shivering and when the king had Candriel straddling him, riding him with lusty determination the poor ellon had made a weird choked sound and for a second he had leaned forward, shuddering all over. There as a spreading dark wet spot on the front of his pants and it was evidence enough, the poor elf was barely able to stand afterwards and Thranduil smirked. One down, one more to go. Candriel had sort of guessed what he wanted and there was a mischievous glint in her eyes as she sat there with the tip of her tongue out of the corner of her mouth and her hips moving in teasing circles. She sat with her back to the guards and since he had spread his legs a bit the two unfortunate guards saw everything in detail. Candriel did nothing to hide the fact that this felt good, she was moaning his name, leaning forward and riding him like an expert. "" Oh this is soo good, oh my lord yes, buck up again, aaahhh, oh yes"" He grinned and did what she wanted, there was a spark of understanding between them, a sort of connection and she blinked an eye and sent the guards a naughty grin. "" Fuck me harder my lord, oh I love to feel your cock, deep deep inside"" The last guard let out a loud whimper, his eyes rolled up and his hips moved back and forth a few times and he was coming without any doubt. He almost let go of his spear and Thranduil could hear how the leather of his gloves were creaking. He had to be squeezing his fists together so hard the leather almost ruptured. They both heard a loud moan and grinned at each other, Thranduil chuckled and grasped her again, bucked fast up and she squealed and met his movements with glee. Before long they both came once more and now both were exhausted and sated. He just laid there next to her for a few minutes, enjoyed the intimacy and the warmth of her skin. He kissed the back of her sweaty neck and she purred and pressed that pert little ass against his groin and he chuckled and gave it a teasing little slap. "" Enough for today my sweet, but be sure that I will require your…skills, again soon"" She bit her lower lip, sweet Eru, she was too sexy for her own good. "" I am looking forward to it my lord"" He nodded. "" Oh I bet you are. Be sure that I will reward your efforts, I do take care of those I treasure. "" She giggled and got up, not shy at all and the two guards were visibly shaken, sweaty and rather disheveled. She did blow him a kiss as she pulled on the dress and hurried off to bathe and get the scent of him off of her. The king hid his smirk and got up too, put on his robe and his boots and grasped the rest of his clothes. He was heading for his private baths and grinned to himself. At least he wasn't bored anymore and he felt a whole lot better. He would send Candriel a really nice gift, perhaps some jewels or a nice dress and he would make sure that everybody knew that she from this day forth was his mistress. Nobody else were to touch her. He turned towards the two guards, they looked deeply ashamed and he wasn't going to let this be the end of it. No, he had plans for them too but that would have to wait a couple of days. Candriel had really managed to satisfy him and he would need a few nights with that book of his before he had a go at the two delectable young warriors. He bet they would be more than ready after this. Both stared at the floor and he put on his normal regal expression. "" Open the hatch to the air channel above the throne room, it needs to be aired out. And then you can consider yourself dismissed, for now that is…"" The two let out a sigh of relief and hurried to do what he asked of them, although with a weird gate. Both had sticky wet pants and he knew the feeling, he watched as they got the hatch open, the room reeked of sex and he didn't want anyone to come by and feel that scent. He went to the baths and started working on his new plan, oh yes, it was going to be just as entertaining and probably just as satisfying. He was suddenly looking forward to the days to come, yes, the next week would be interesting for sure."
210,2,19,2-Nuredhel-19.txt,lord-of-the-rings,Nuredhel,"the Feanorions at once than letting her return to life but nevertheless, he was regarded as a married man and… Elhadron had simply shut himself off, he had turned all of his attention to his favorite pastime, reading and politics and one of the reasons was that his marriage had been a very chaste one to say the least. She had been in command the whole time and she had mocked him a lot and left him with a sense of being so inferior and flawed he never had dared thinking about other females at all. The few times he had been allowed to touch his wife she had complained about him being boring, being too loud, being too small, too lazy, without a sense of rhythm and so on and so forth until he stopped asking her completely. Naturally they had no children and he knew that he would spend his life in loneliness until he sailed. He couldn't risk getting involved with females again. But this one, so sweet, such lovely dark eyes, he shouldn't dare to hope but he did anyhow. Maybe his luck was about to change? Oh he shouldn't, he really shouldn't, he would most certainly make a complete fool out of himself but that feeling…. Elhadron wasn't able to think about the book now, he couldn't get her face out of his mind, nor her body. He could smell her still, and he gave up. With a gasp he got back onto his feet and ran back to his chambers, closing the door hard behind him and just praying that nobody had seen his far from dignified exodus. He didn't know what to do, the images in his mind were so indecent his wife would have made him deaf from her yelling had she been there and known about it and he was aching. He wandered around the rooms almost desperately, trying to think of everything else, tax reports, the number of sacks of flour stored in the storages, the best way to cure piles, it didn't work. All he could think about was that soft back end pressing against his body and with a hoarse yell he threw all resistance out the door and ripped his pants open, fell back into a chair which threatened to dissolve into its smallest parts from the impact and grasped onto himself. He hadn't done that since he was a mere youth, before his wife put the shame and fear into him, but his body still knew how it felt, and how it ought to be done. He closed his eyes and panted as he kept thrusting into his own grip and he groaned and whimpered and before long he came hard with a scream, legs shaking and hips jerking desperately and he thought he could die, it was such a relief, such an insane relief. When he came to again he discovered that he had thick streaks of seed all over his chest and hand and his tunic had to be burned for sure for he couldn't let the washing ladies see this. But he felt better, in control again. He sighed and got up on trembling legs, he couldn't remember ever having felt thus with his wife, he couldn't remember coming at all in the years they had spent together. But now he had flushed the desire out of his system and could go back to normal, thank Eru for that. He had needed it but now things didn't bother him that much anymore and he could return to the books and give them his full attention. He allowed himself to relax for a few minutes more, then he got out of his soiled clothing before he took a quick bath. Tomorrow she would return his robe and that would be the last he would see of her. It was as it ought to be, he was way too old for such a beautiful thing and she would never allow him to touch her, after all, there were so many attractive young ellyn around. That evening Thranduil met Candriel by chance in one of the corridors, she bowed her head to him and grinned widely. "" How are things going?"" He returned the smile. "" Very well thank you, I have managed to convince that pious hag that I am one of the maiar and that I am to ""bless"" her"" Candriel laughed out loud. "" Oh Eru, that sounds like a great plan, but will she allow you to do it somewhere public?"" Thranduil cocked his head. "" When I am done with her I bet she would agree if I suggested doing it upon the throne."" Candriel shook her finger back and forth. "" Do not be too cocky now my king, being to over confident may come back to bite you."" He just sniggered and raised an eyebrow. "" And you my dear, how are your plan going so far?"" Candriel giggled. "" Very well thank you, I think I gave that poor ellon the first hard on he has had in years. I bet he is somewhere in his rooms wanking off right now, and tomorrow I will continue, he is surely going to learn that not all females are fire breathing dragons."" Thranduil petted her on her back and stole a quick kiss. "" Just let me know when you are going to go for it for real, I want to watch. "" Candriel sent him a wry grin. "" Worry not, I will."" Thranduil saw her wandering off to work and then he returned to his own rooms to prepare himself for the nights great endeavor, soon he would have Gelinnas eating off his hand, he was sure of it. He would win the bet and then he would really reap the fruits of his labor. He chuckled to himself as he found the costume and the liquid, he could almost taste victory already and the taste was sweet."
211,2,29,2-Nuredhel-29.txt,lord-of-the-rings,Nuredhel,"him. He was of course so much smarter than they were and he was a chosen one. Of course they did envy him, he had the power of the lord in him, was his knight. How pitiful they all were, how pathetic. Their empty little lives, dancing around that golden calf called money while he, he was guaranteed his place beside the lord when his time came to leave this tainted earth. But that wouldn't happen soon, of course not. He would live for a long time doing the lords work and when his final hour came he would be welcomed by the angels choir and the lord would let him rest beside him on the throne, he didn't deserve less. He was getting impatient, then he heard a sound. A twig snapped and he whipped his head around, what he saw made him squeak like a bath toy and he pissed himself. His erection had disappeared like dewdrops for the sun and his legs shivering. It was a wolf, a giant wolf. There are no such things, the sane part of his brain tried to make sense of what he saw but couldn't. A wolf of Satan, black with red eyes, of course, his enemy tried to get rid of him. He had sent too many of the devils loyal temptresses down to him. He pulled his cross out, backed away from the terrifying creature with the sacred symbol held high. ""Be gone, spawn of hell, I command thee in the name of the lord"" The wolf laughed, no other word could describe it. It continued to walk forth while it licked it's jaws. The cross didn't work? He turned to run and that was the last thing he ever did. He stared straight into a pair of huge yellow eyes and a giant paw hit him square in the chest. He flew backwards, didn't have time to scream before powerful jaws closed around his head and crushed it like you would crush an egg. His last thought was ""Why has the lord betrayed me?"" Shoroya spat, used her paw to clean her tongue and teeth of the disgusting blood and flesh. Humans didn't taste good at all, but it was needed. She felt better, her energy surged. Rick changed back, he was naked but it didn't bother him at all. He grasped the corpse and placed it underneath some unstable rocks, then he let a couple fall onto the head, made it look like an accident. As if the man had tried to hide something between the boulders and set off a small avalanche. When he was done nobody would be able to see the real cause of death and he walked over to the car, popped the trunk and grinned. ""See? Hypocritical bastard"" He took out a small box, it contained some items that made him cringe, hairpins, jewelry, souvenirs and trophy's from the dead man's victims. He shoved the box into the dead guys hand and then he used a branch to remove their own footprints and paw prints. Shoroya stood there and he turned once more, bared his teeth. ""Wanna hunt for real?"" She nodded. ""Yes, lets. "" A short hour later they shared a rabbit and laid underneath a pine just relaxing. She purred and wished that she could stay like this forever. But it wasn't possible, it didn't work that way. She could choose when she wanted to change back now but it only worked one way. They would have to make love for her to become the panther again and she had to kill a human to take human shape once she was the cat. It was the way it always had been. It was the price she had to pay. They heard the sound of thunder in the distance and retreated back to the truck, it had started to rain now and it was really pouring down. When they got to the truck lightning shot through the skies and the thunder claps made the ground shake. Rick changed back and so did she, it always felt like a failure, like a defeat. She wouldn't feel that power again for a long time, not until they found another possible target. Never kill the innocent, that was their rule, always go for the one's whom nobody would miss and who 's death would benefit the world. She shivered, got her clothes back on, he did the same and kissed her lovingly. ""Feel any better?"" She nodded. ""Yes, very much so."" He grinned and let his fingers glide through her hair. ""You look better, years younger again."" She nodded and knew he was right, it had renewed her. ""I know, but I still miss it, being who I really am."" He nuzzled her neck. ""Of course you do my love."" The thunder got closer and they got into the car, they would spend the night there now. She pulled her blanket around her and leaned against him, he was as warm as always, like an oven. His eyes gazed out at the rain and the flashes of light. ""That is one hell of a storm, I have never seen anything like it. "" She nodded. ""Me neither, the forecast didn't tell of a storm?"" He shook his head. ""No it didn't, it told of clear skies. Strange."" She was glad they were in the car, if lightning struck they would be safe there. The car worked like a Faraday cage and would protect them. Then there was an almighty crash and a flash so bright it made her blind for a few seconds. She squealed and held her hands in front of her face and the whole car jumped and she heard the tires explode. Holy heck, we been hit, that was the last thing she had time to think before the world sort of dropped beneath them and she felt Rick pull her tight to protect her. Then it all went completely black."
212,2,33,2-Nuredhel-33.txt,lord-of-the-rings,Nuredhel,"and Glorfindel felt tired so they pulled the furs over themselves and slept for a while, embracing and entwined like two trees sharing the same spot in the sun. When Glorfindel woke up it was to the feeling of a tongue which very slowly and with devilish determination was exploring his cock and balls and he gasped and surrendered. Elladan wasn't that experienced, he had barely ever tried to give a blow job but he had zeal and he had learned a little when Glorfindel went down on him. The lack of sophistication was just charming and Glorfindel was smart enough to just let Dan set the pace without trying to push him in any way. Elladan was struggling a bit, Fin was large and he had to really think to figure out how he was to do this without choking for it really challenged his gag reflex. But he found a method that didn't cause him too much discomfort and Glorfindel sort of praised him with gentle words and touches and in the end the golden haired warrior came, moaning Dan's name. Elladan had to swallow and he sort of cringed, it was saltier and more bitter than he had imagined it would be but not too bad, just something he wasn't used to yet. Afterwards they laid there snuggling again and through the night they would wake up every now and then and repeat the joyful activities they had engaged in. When the sun rose the next day they woke up when the lady of the farm knocked on the door, she entered carrying a basket with their dried and washed clothes and she sent them a wink and a crooked grin. There was no doubt that she sort of understood what they had been doing and both had visible hickeys and other marks as well. The room did reek of sex but she didn't seem to mind, she just left the clothes and a servant maid came with more food. They got dressed and ate in silence, they didn't need any words to express their feelings, their fëar were humming in unison now, bonded by shared feelings. It was a very strong bond, close to unbreakable. When they were finished Glorfindel thanked the farmer and his wife for their hospitality and left one of his gold buttons as payment for the food and the room. The farmer claimed that the honor of housing an elven lord was more than enough but Fin knew that the button would be valuable for them, there were many things the farm couldn't produce and such things had to be bought. Gold was valuable and could get them many things. Asfaloth was well rested and neighed as Glorfindel got in the saddle, Elladan got up behind him and they rode off, eager to meet the others again. They reached the village by nightfall and were welcomed by the rest of the troop. They had gotten there safely and were enjoying the inn's good food and wine and also the baths. The ellon they had travelled to meet proved to be a grouch like few others and Glorfindel knew that Elrond would regret having invited him. Back in the old days Cernaron had been way more agreeable but now he had turned as sour as pickled lemons. The other warriors didn't need much time before they realized that something had happened. Both Glorfindel and Elladan were practically radiant and couldn't keep their hands off each other and many jokes were made but the two didn't mind. They were too happy to notice anything except each other and they still had problems understanding how they both could have been so goddamn blind. They had been pining for years, for nothing. So now they were making up for spent time and the rest of the inn did hear that, very well. They had to stay for a few days longer because of the two injured horses but finally they could return to Imladris and that part of the journey went well without any surprises of any kind. The only thing which happened was that Cernaron got bucked off his horse and into a snowdrift when he tried to make the animal walk faster. The warriors were left sniggering, even horses knows when it is enough. Luckily the scribe held his mouth shut after that and when they reached Imladris he was almost agreeable, at least he didn't snap at everybody whenever they said something. Elrond was welcoming his guest, then he did notice the odd behavior of his captain and eldest son and before long he knew the truth too. Dan had never looked so happy and Glorfindel was no longer acting like a cat who has devoured a shrew, he was smiling and joking and being just wonderful yet again and Elrond let out a sigh of relief. He had feared that he would have to have a very serious talk with the captain soon if he didn't cheer up but now he didn't have to. He was happy also for another reason, now there was little doubt that Dan would follow Glorfindel wherever he went and Elrond knew that the warrior would return to the blessed realm whence their time in middle earth was over. And when Elladan went there was little doubt that Elrohir would go to. Ro was very happy for his brother and congratulated him wholeheartedly and a week after they returned Dan entered his room to find the bed covered with a gigantic new fur bed cover made from the wolves they had slain. Ro had gotten some of the warriors to ride out in secret and skin the carcasses and now the huge pelt became a very precious belonging. Dan and Fin had unholy lot of fun on it and when it was worn out it was burned with a great deal of grief. But at last the wolves had been useful, in more ways than just one."
213,2,5,2-Nuredhel-5.txt,lord-of-the-rings,Nuredhel,"the inside of the islands, between them and Alqualonde."" Elrond made a grimace and grasped onto Ecthelion who did look a wee bit better, but no less bizarre with the black stains on his lips and his hair in sweaty ropes down his back. ""Write a letter to the harbor master of Alqualonde and warn him of this danger. Nobody ought to eat anything caught in those waters until the cold weather returns."" The noldorin lord just nodded and waddled off to do what he was told to do and Elrond continued working, and it was indeed a tough job for not all would drink that black goo voluntarily. He and three other strong Ellyn had to subdue Rog and forcefeed him the stuff and he swore so bad Elrond wished he could go deaf just for a few minutes and the huge elf did spit some of the goo onto Elrond who by now looked very colorful indeed. After a couple of hours it was getting clear that the worst was over, the puking had stopped, the convulsions too and everybody was out of the dangerzone but many had a terrible stomach ache and Elrond had to prescribe both rest, certain herbs and a special diet for the lot of them. Not all were all that happy about it. Rog almost threw another tantrum when he was told that he had to lay off the booze for a month and the rest of the lords of Gondolin shared his lack of enthusiasm and made that clear with surprisingly strong arguments, and voices. But Elrond didn't budge and he knew that the wine salesmen of Tirion and Formenos probably would blame him for a decrease in their income for the next weeks but what the heck, the health of these elves were more important than money and besides, they could all need to sober up a bit. He knew that some drank wine like others drink water, their livers would thank him in the end. When Elrond finally was done it was late and he looked horrible, his braid undone, he was covered with sick and charcoal and one of the servants had by accident spilled a bowl of some sort of shrimp based soup all over his back so now he smelled of that too. The palace would be cleaned up but it would be a task of monumental proportions and Elrond did pity the cleaners, they would need strong stomachs no doubt, in special since the weather was just as hot as it had been, if not worse. He didn't stop by his office but rode straight home, mumbling something about the worst day of this age, and a severe lack of appetite. He didn't bathe or change, and that was with purpose. At least Celebrian would see and smell why her husband refused to eat her delicious stew. He stopped in front of their home and took a deep breath, as a healer he knew that rare cases often appeared in clusters and this had been one of those cases, one rather innocent and one not but both had puke in common. He frowned, why didn't his stable worker come to get his horse? He got down from the black gelding and put it into the stable on his own and then he entered the house and knew that no, the day was not over yet, not by far. His butler lay on a couch just inside of the entrance, and he was greener than the great greenwood. He had a bucket in front of him and it was full. In the main hall his servants and his wife were assembled, all with buckets in front of them and all very miserable and Elrond suddenly realized that the valar did love him indeed. They had spared him from a cruel fate by sending those cases in his way. Celebrian was whimpering and she was sweaty and shivering. "" Oh meleth nin, I am so sorry, but we are all ill. Oh sweetness, what in all of Arda have you been doing? The smell…."" She started retching and Elrond just smiled, he had gotten so accustomed to the smell by now it didn't bother him anymore and now he had an excellent excuse for not wanting any stew. He smiled and caressed her back, he had some charcoal stacked away somewhere, it would come in handy. ""Oh you know, the usual, puking nobles and puking elflings"" She rolled her eyes. ""We couldn't wait with the stew Elrond, so we all ate early and now we are sick, so sick"" Elrond nodded and his smile was one of gratefulness. ""Tell me my sweet, did you add some seafood to that stew today?"" Celebrian frowned. "" How did you know? Yes, I did. The fish sellers at the market had some very nice scallops and I bought some and added it to the stew yes, to give it some salty flavor? Why?"" Elrond got up to get the charcoal. ""Because my dear, this day isn't as terrible as I thought it would be, lay still and I will get you some medicine. Throw the rest of the stew outside"" Celebrian just looked very confused and Elrond managed to get enough medicine for everybody there, the stew was thrown onto the garbage heap behind the garden shed and nobody thought any more of it until the next morning when Elrond, refreshed and grateful that he hadn't come home in time to get food poisoning too stepped outside just to be attacked by a whole armada of very angry puking seagulls who had eaten the rest of the stew and now were out for vengeance. When the healer made it back inside he was covered with goo yet again and had to take a bath, when you think you are off the hook you are wrong most of the times and this time the valar did get the last laugh after all."
214,2,2,2-Nuredhel-2.txt,lord-of-the-rings,Nuredhel,"cistern had lain on top of everything else it went straight up. Towards the royal chambers! Thranduil had been sitting there minding his own business, reading a little and trying to relax enough to get things started. He had just decided that this was futile and that the healer would receive a royal visitor that very day when there was a sound like a strong wind and he lifted his head and frowned. Then it hit him, an attack quite literally from the back. He was lifted off the seat and drenched in the pea soup thick water filled with algae and moss and things that just could be described as stuff. Within seconds he was completely drenched and in blind panic he just pulled his breeches up and ran. Elladan and Legolas were running towards the royal wing of the palace, everywhere elves were scurrying around, terrified and nauseous and utterly confused. There was sewage water everywhere and some guards had enough common sense to order that every gate was to be opened and the place evacuated. The peredhel ran into the corridor leading towards the king's chambers and stopped, staring with wide eyes. A terrible apparition came waddling towards them, a shape covered with things nobody were even able to describe, stinking and moaning and the shape was like that of an elf but otherwise it could be just about anything. And from the other direction another ghoul came staggering, wet and green with long hair with algae and sea weed in it. Legolas screamed, wailed from the top of his lungs. ""The ghosts!"" Then he fainted and Elladan just stared too for a few seconds before his lights too went out. He had seen a lot in his life but this? This he had not been ready for! Luckily he fell backwards and Legolas landed on top of him and that was where Elrond and Elrohir found him. They came running just as Elladan toppled over and stopped, staring at the two ghoulish figures that actually crashed into each other since both had their eyes closed. There was a splash and a lot of very wet sounds and the two collapsed into a heap of soiled robes, stinking water and desperate elves trying to escape. Both were gasping for air and clawing at each other, trying to get back up but since both were slick with slimy goo they just fell back onto the slick floor. It looked like a wrestling match from hell! Elrohir wetted his lips, he didn't know where it came from but it just burst forth. "" I…I guess the two ghosts did find each other then, after all. How romantic!"" Elrond shot his son a glare that could have frozen the great sea, then he got busy trying to help everybody. It took weeks to clean the palace and everybody had to live outdoors until it was done. The servants had never encountered anything like this and they were often desperate since so much had to be burned or thrown away. The lower levels where the worst and so they started at the top and cleaned their way downwards. When the palace finally was back to normal it was almost time to celebrate yule and the celebration that year became a rather muted one. Thranduil and Galion spent three days bathing after this, scrubbing and rubbing and using several gallons of soap and shampoo. They were red like lobsters for days afterwards and Galion was so mortified and traumatized he did cut his hair! And he didn't eat for a month and became so skinny Thranduil had him fed with the fattiest food they had, which he utterly loathed. Legolas was terrified of the privies for years to come and he never fully overcame that fear. Even when he was travelling with the fellowship he preferred doing his business out in the bushes even when they were in Lothlorien and Edoras, much to the amusement of the others. Elladan was never allowed to forget what his little fairy tale had caused of mayhem and Elrond was beside himself with shame and sent a huge amount of gems to the king to compensate for the damage. Thranduil did willingly and gleefully accept it all. Elrohir laughed until he almost developed a hernia and teased his brother mercilessly for centuries to come. But one positive thing did come from it all, the shock had cured Thranduil's constipation, once and for all! -I wrote this story because of Halloween and I sort of got the idea because someone mentioned a Halloween story and it just dropped into my head while I was hanging clothes onto the drying rack…Yep, domestic chores gives me ideas too. One of the ideas behind this I got from reading history, back in the old castles the privies were hanging on the outside of the walls but earlier on everything ended up in the basement and there was one incident where the vapors and gases from all the gathered feces and urine made the floors give in and everybody in the great hall of that castle fell into the basement during a wedding or something and many drowned. That has got to be the most horrible way to go ever! Drowning in shit! And the idea for the design of the palace sewer system I got from one of Jael's stories. There can be methane gas produced by sewers and that is explosive indeed. That idea I took from one of my own novels where the characters go looking for a lost cistern and when they find it they drop a torch into it and cause a huge explosion. Yep, elves does poop too, it would have been cool if their combustion was so perfect nothing was wasted of what they ate but I guess they are more like us there. I guess Elladan must have learned that not all stories are made to be shared with kids, after this one."

After a while they got back up, took a bath and rested and Haldir was more than willing when Adraste started caressing him again. There seemed to be no limit to his endurance and strength this day and he just let go of all doubt and fear and let the moment guide him. Before the night fell he had taken Adraste two more times and he had also had Bogdhan and when the fire of passion died down and he was completely sated he fell asleep with the warm bodies of the other two snuggled up against him. He had never felt that happy before and this night he slept without a single nightmare. The next day he was as good as new and Adraste offered to transport him back home, he accepted gratefully and he had a hard time saying goodbye to them. He was so very thankful for what they had done for him and he almost wept. Bogdhan hugged him and kissed him with passion and Adraste did too. Haldir was in a way glad he could leave, if he had stayed just one more day he would have fallen in love with both. He petted the huge feline goodbye and wasn't even a bit nervous and Bogdhan's huge steed did sniff him and it did lick his hand. Bogdhan told him that such actions were a sign of acceptance. Not many could get that close to the animal without being bitten or worse and Haldir now knew that the beast was the result of crossing a mare with a Pegasus, then crossing that offspring with a unicorn and the result of that union with a kelpie. Adraste promised to drop Haldir in a spot not too far away from the city and he hugged them one last time and had problems holding back tears. Adraste just touched his cheek. ""Don't feel bad mellon, I have enjoyed our time together and I am glad I could help you with your problems."" He kissed her and promised himself that he would remember her scent forever. He got a tight hug from Bogdhan and whispered a final thank you before the world seemed to spin in front of his eyes and when he opened them again he stood on a glen just outside of the city. Adraste and Bogdhan returned to their world knowing that they had done a good job and both were very pleased with the stay in middle earth. Sometimes working can be fun. Haldir was discovered by some of the guards as he came strolling along the path, there was suddenly a minor chaos erupting. They had all assumed that he was dead when they found his dead horse and they assumed that the orcs had brought his body along for food. His brothers had been beside themselves with fear and grief and when they heard that their brother was alive and well they came running and threw themselves around his neck, crying and laughing with joy and shock. Even the lady herself came to see if it really was true that her adoptive son had returned in one piece and she hugged him and was a bit confused. She hadn't been able to feel him for more than two days and she had been certain that he had perished. Haldir explained that he had been knocked off his horse after it had run off with him and a travelling healer had found him and fixed him. He didn't want to explain everything to Galadriel in every explicit detail and absolutely not to his brothers. He just answered vaguely that the healer had some magical abilities and had shielded them so that the orcs wouldn't find them while Haldir regained his strength. Everybody was filled with relief and joy and that night they had a great celebration, one of their own had been believed to be lost but had returned and that did call for a real party. After some days things did return to normal but then Orophin and Rumil got the shock of a lifetime. They had been out hunting and were dead tired and when they got back home ready for a good night's sleep there was a racket from Haldir's talan. Orophin stared at Rumil with wide eyes and shock written all over his face. ""What the …?!"" Rumil swallowed, he was shocked too. There was no doubt about what their brother was doing. They heard that clearly. ""Oohh Haldir, Aahh yes, harder! Ahh yes, fuck me faster!"" Both giggled but the shock was still apparent in their eyes. ""Oro, wasn't that the voice of…?"" Orophin nodded, his eyes as wide as tea cups. ""Yes, he's here to train some of the warriors in strategy and tactics. "" Rumil just gasped. ""Damn it, I never thought that Haldir even was interested in fucking anyone, and absolutely not him! He is famous damn it."" Orophin listened to the sounds coming from the talan. ""Well, our brother has definitely changed, I wonder how that happened?"" Rumil just shuddered. ""Some questions are best left unanswered. Gods, how are we going to get any sleep?"" Orophin put his fingers in his ears.""Yes indeed how!"" The next morning a tall golden haired figure was seen sneaking out of Haldir's talan and he looked like a cat that has devoured a whole bowl of cream. Haldir was in a very good mood too but his brothers not so much so. They were red eyed and stared at him with grumpy expressions. Haldir just grinned. ""What's the matter boys, you look tired?"" Orophin groaned and Rumil pouted. ""You kept us awake all night, darn it Haldir, I haven't been able to close an eye."" Haldir just grinned even wider and winked at his brothers. ""Well, payback is a bitch now isn't it?"""

The servant nodded. ""I can assure you m'gentlemen, he is every bit as stunning as the rumors tell you he is."" Hakon grinned, a grin that told of expectations and it made him look rather unscrupulous. The servant waved his hand and Aragorn did notice that there were three guards at this place, very discretely placed but armed and ready to strike if anybody started making problems. They went down a corridor and passed yet another guard and a metal door. They went down a stair and another guard was placed at the end of it. Aragorn did notice everything there, they needed to see and remember every obstacle. They entered a long corridor with what had to be prison cells and at the end was a heavy steel door with bars in front of it. They obviously guarded this elf if that was what he was as if he was made from pure gold. A guard let them through and they entered a small room without windows, it was lighted by some torches and lamps and it was rather naked with only a couple of benches and a sort of bed. At the back of the room on a pile of old straw sat a naked person on his knees, his head hung forward and he had chains across his back to his wrists and then up to the ceiling. The creature was shivering and the fair skin was covered with cuts and bruises, the wrists swollen and dark and it looked skinny. Aragorn just stared, long copper red hair hung around the pale figure and it was thick and shiny but unkempt and filthy. Pointy ears did protrude from it and the ranger let out a small sigh, it was true. It was an elf, or was it? The figure just sat there, held up by the chains and just the movements of the chest told them he was alive, the face was covered by the hair and the servant grinned widely. ""See? Isn't he lovely? I can assure you, he is better than any female and far more beautiful than any of our whores but of course a bit hard to handle. We need the chains unfortunately, he bit one customer and tried to break the neck of another one, but look at that skin and that body."" Hakon licked his lips as if the sight of the chained elf did arouse him. ""You are right, he is stunning, such beauty."" Aragorn had to agree with Hakon's words, the elf was stunning. Even among the fair folk this male was exceptional and the long limbs were muscular and elegant. He looked like a chained panther and Aragorn felt a bit puzzled by the red hair, few elves had that color. The servant felt very sure of these clients and misunderstood their silence for awe and lust. ""If he was but a little tamer we would of course expand the possibilities but as it is now a good fuck is all we can offer. You don't want that thing near your cock with his teeth, believe me."" Hakon nodded and tried to act as if he found the sight very tempting. ""I bet you have a lot of customers for this treasure?"" The servant grinned. ""Oh yes, the master has people asking about him every day, but only those who can pay are allowed near him. But of course, there has been some since we got our hands on him and what a lucky day that was for our little business."" Hakon cocked his head. ""Now, how on earth did you manage that? To get an elf? I am impressed to say the least."" Grimurd had put his hand down his pants as if he was playing with himself but he had turned his back to the others and he was trying to see if the door could be unlocked easily and without too much noise. Aragorn was leaning a little forward too, as if he was bothered by a raging hard on but he was trying to see if the chains could be removed without a key or if it was needed. The servant looked very important. ""We got him from a group of shall we say tradesmen from the north, they had caught him somewhere in the mountains a few weeks ago. He has been here two weeks now and is still going strong, my master will make a fortune on him."" Hakon rearranged his pants a bit, tried to breathe a little faster and it wasn't that hard at all since he was pissed off. Aragorn was even more enrages, two weeks? That had to be two weeks in hell and he just knew that they had to get this unfortunate ellon out of there as fast as possible. Then the prisoner raised his head, a moaning sound could be heard and Aragorn had to kneel down to take a look at this person. The curtain of long thick hair slid aside as the ellon pulled at the chains and Aragorn had to stifle a gasp. Eyes were staring at him, filled with agony and fear and yet they burned with pride, with defiance. This was one person who hadn't given up, who never would give in. This was a soul ready to fight for his dignity and freedom and Aragorn had a hard time believing what he did see. The elf had the strangest eyes he ever had seen, deep golden with a dark ring around the irises and the pupil was like that of a cat. And the face so beautiful it could have been sculpted with an angel as model. The ranger stared at the strange eyes and he whispered to himself so low nobody could hear it. ""By Eru, who and what are you?"""

Ravenne nodded and felt how the cold solid stone against her hands made this whole conversation strangely unreal. ""I know, I just wish I knew the meaning behind it all."" Astarion sent her a sad grin. ""If we knew that we would be gods and that my dear sister we are not!"" She smiled at him, he looked so much like their mother when it came to the shape of his face and the gracefulness of his movements but he also had his father's height and she knew that a whole bunch of ellith had become heart broken when he found his one and wed her. She petted her brother on his shoulder. ""At least our family line is secured, you have sired enough elflings to keep the house of Oropher going for several millennia."" Astarion sighed and there was something dark in his eyes. ""Speaking of the devil, have you met our uncle lately?"" Ravenne lifted an eyebrow, she made a grimace. ""No, not this time. I met Cunarin last time I was home, it was…interesting!"" Astarion looked as if he had tasted something rather rotten. ""That's the right word sister, I know he is my uncle but I hate his guts, he is so darn arrogant. I would have guessed that spending several ages in the halls of Mandos would make him a more agreeable person but no, he is a load of horse dung!"" Ravenne had to laugh. ""Yes, he is. But remember he was so young when he died and he never learned anything about living, and I don't think he learned more while being among the other awaiting their chance to enter a new body."" Astarion chuckled. ""Weird really, Ada told me a lot of Daeradar and his ways and I was scared like hell to meet him but he was not that bad. That is one ellon who has changed and that to the better."" Ravenne grinned. ""I guess getting killed can do that to you yes. I know Ada was terrified too when he learned that his father had been re-embodied and was waiting to meet him. I have never seen ada that scared but it went surprisingly well. They spoke, cried, spoke some more and got drunk together."" Astarion nodded and watched as his youngest daughter tried to get her nanny to bathe in a fountain with her. He smiled and Ravenne was amazed by how beautiful and good her brother was. He and their sister was just pure light while she on the other hand sometimes felt as if though she consisted of just darkness. ""The best way to rebuild broken bonds yes, I think Oropher was even more scared than ada, he knew what he had done and I think he still is terribly sorry."" Astarion had a sad expression in his eyes. ""You are right, he is still suffering. He treated Ada like shit and he almost broke him completely. There are going to be a lot of healing being done before those two are done with the past and has everything put behind them."" Ravenne had to laugh. ""Yes, but remember when Cunarin thought that he could order ada around? By Saurons teeth did he get a surprise! "" Astarion nodded, his eyes were glittering with mirth. ""Ada hasn't been ruling as a king for several millennia without getting the needed authority, and a vocabulary of cusswords worthy of an award. I have never seen anyone turn pale that fast."" Ravenne bit her lower lip, she had actually sparred against her uncle once, he had been very patronizing and quite convinced that an elleth was unable to fight, she had proven him very wrong! She had beat him thoroughly and well and he had left the sparring ring limping and looking as if he had swallowed a pound of sour lemons. Astarion shook his head. ""Elinde, don't push your nanny!"" Ravenne smiled and Astarion bowed his head. ""I have to go sister, it appears that my offspring is trying to drown our dear nanny in the horse's water trough"" Ravenne just nodded and turned around. She could see that a caravan of wagons bringing goods from the coast had arrived and the drivers were standing by them fixing the harnesses of their horses or just chatting away. She was getting curious, she wanted to know if anything of interest had happened back there and she walked towards them and they saw her and bowed their heads in respect. ""So, is there any news from the coast?"" The drivers just shrugged. ""Not much, there are some new settlements being build and they want to expand the main roads. "" The man speaking was a rather short ellon with a strange sandy color to his hair and pale blue eyes. Ravenne had not seen him before and he was dressed rather poorly. Another ellon petted his horse on its neck. ""Well, there are some rumors spreading from up north, someone found some dead elves."" Ravenne frowned. ""Dead elves? Here? That is impossible?"" The ellon nodded. ""Yes, but I heard it from a guard, he was rather adamant too. It was true. He said that at least five elves had been found dead in their home."" Ravenne shook her head in disbelief. ""Could it have been some sort of suicide? I know that some are driven insane by this place"" The driver just shrugged. ""I have no clue, that was all I was told."" Ravenne smiled. ""Well, if something serious is going on I am sure we will hear of it soon."" She just turned and left and little did she know that those words would come back to haunt her later. She had heard the first dark omen, and she did not yet know of it but soon a new sort of darkness would fall over her world and everything would change, and the change would be dramatic."
218,2,13,2-Nuredhel-13.txt,lord-of-the-rings,Nuredhel,"Candriel managed to keep the silly smile on her face, the thing was being pushed into her with such force it almost made the chair move and she felt that she was close to coming. "" I…I am very fine, thank you!"" Oh he knew how to play her, to tease her and keep her on the very edge of release and Candriel was close to begging him now, shamelessly for everybody to hear. Thranduil sent her a devious glance from beneath his dark eyelashes and he flicked his ankle a few times and Candriel was seeing stars and sparks as it felt as if her very core exploded in pleasure. She would have screamed if she hadn't managed to grasp her own napkin and press it against her mouth. She moaned and gasped and the elleth next to her looked aghast. "" My lady, you do need a healer!"" Candriel pretended to be retching a bit. "" Oh there must have been basil in the sauce, it makes me sick. I…I will go to the healer, yes."" She had to wait for a few minutes, her legs wouldn't carry her yet and she felt his foot against her wet pussy one last time, a teasing and warning touch. Candriel got up and she did see that everybody stared at her. Luckily there hadn't been any visible stains left since her dress had absorbed all of her juices and the underskirt was dark so nobody would see anything. She sent a sheepish grin to everybody and grasped her stomach as if she was in pain and Thranduil got up too. He looked as if he was truly concerned and tilted his head. "" My lady? You do look very flushed, I think you ought to be escorted to your chambers. Let me do it, I need some fresh air so there is no inconvenience"" Candriel had a hard time biting back a rather sarcastic answer but she managed to smile sweetly. "" Oh your grace is just too kind"" He walked around the table and took her arm, everybody found it rather endearing that the king had such compassion for his subjects. He walked her out of the hall and then he suddenly grasped her by her waist and pushed her against the wall, there was nobody there and he kissed her hard. Candriel gasped and she saw that dark glimpse in his eyes and knew that he wasn't done yet. Oh Eru have mercy! There was a stairway leading up towards the gallery that ran the entire length of the great hall and he dragged her with him up there. The gallery was very narrow, two people could walk side by side but only if they were narrow and it had a very lovely railing carved from stone. The gallery was rather high above the hall but if someone did look up they could see everybody that were up there and Candriel wanted to turn around and head back down but he grasped onto her again, made her grasp the top of the railing with both hands. Then he lifted her skirts up around her waist and kicked her legs apart and Candriel didn't believe his audacity, if someone were to take a glance up at the gallery they couldn't misunderstand what they were doing! He put one hand on her back, made her arch and then he pushed inside of her with just one thrust. Candriel shivered, they were looking down at all the guests and the entire hall and Thranduil was fucking her hard. He was slamming into her and she could only bite her lip to prevent herself from screaming. The thrill of it all, and the nervous energy undid her completely. She came hard once more, squirting all over his crotch and he made a grimace. Shit, he had to change his trouser, again! He continued to thrust and she felt how he lost his rhythm and tensed up and then he came and continued thrusting, riding out his orgasm. He pulled out as the last jet of seed left him, coating her smooth ass. Candriel almost collapsed and he turned her around, kissed her again as he almost carried her down the stairs. She felt how the sticky come got smeared all over her bottom and the underskirt had to be washed thoroughly. She winced and stared at him. ""What the hell did you use on me?"" Thranduil smirked and pulled his robe a little aside and she did stare down at a pair of very unusual shoes, they were extremely elongated and the tip was almost banana shaped and did look rather obscene. The tip of his left shoe was dark with her juices still and she felt herself blush violently. ""What in Eru's name is that?"" Thranduil grinned. "" Some old fashion monstrosities, they were popular for a few years when my father ruled, everybody had to wear them and the longer the tip the better. My father put an end to it though, he claimed that he already had a functional cock so he didn't need two more!"" Candriel had to laugh. "" Well said, they do look like cocks."" He nodded and kissed her again, gently this time. "" You are my little vixen and I love you but don't do anything like that again without warning me first. By the way, I am not the first to use such shoes in that manner, it was rather common back then. I have kept this pair just as a sentimental memory of those days but I am glad that they came to good use one last time"" Candriel grimaced. "" Right, burn them please, they are atrocious."" He embraced her and grinned against her neck. "" As the lady wishes, but you will have to admit that I did win this little race?"" Candriel sighed, he turned everything into a competition. "" Yes, you did win, but only by a foot!"""
219,2,20,2-Nuredhel-20.txt,lord-of-the-rings,Nuredhel,"son screaming in pain. Elrohir just lay there and Glorfindel sent out patrols every day, searching for Avanwar, it was obvious that he had fled and the gods alone knew to where. They could just hope that they caught him in the end. Three weeks later both the young ellyn woke up, simultaneously. Both were weak and Elladan was in a lot of pain but other from that the broken ribs had healed and so had his bruises and wounds. Elrond almost passed out with relief and Celebrian and Arwen were crying with joy. Glorfindel stayed away now, almost as if he suddenly had become shy of them all, and he barely showed himself in public. Elladan was being fed only soup and had to stay in bed for yet another week but Elrohir recovered fast and told his father of Avanwar's true intentions. Elrond got very concerned and sent letters to both Galadriel and Cirdan with warnings. If Avanwar really carried something that hid his true nature to the rings then everybody could be in danger now. Finally Elladan was strong enough to leave the infirmary, he was walking with a stick for a while and he had terrible nightmares but he was making progress. Then one evening he met Glorfindel in the park, the balrog slayer sat there with a book and Elladan took a deep breath and gathered his courage, walked over. Glorfindel started when he saw who it was that approached him, he almost looked scared for a moment and Elladan smiled gently. He was pale and thin still and he couldn't use much strength before he became exhausted but he was getting there, it just took a while. ""May I sit down?"" Glorfindel swallowed hard. His eyes almost shy and he nodded. ""Of course"" Elladan took Glorfindel's hand and the golden warrior gasped, stared at the peredhel with wide eyes. He had feared that Elladan would blame him after all, that the words he had said were just empty, brought forth by a brain that was dying. The hand was so soft and warm and even though it lacked strength now it would return soon enough. ""I remember it Fin, everything. Every word you said"" Glorfindel felt small, no, tiny, nervous like a mouse crouching in front of a cat. ""You do?"" His voice but a faint whisper. Elladan nodded and kissed his hand, there was something moist on his cheeks. ""Yes, and I meant what I said too, I am yours, if you still want me that is"" There was some trepidation in those last words, some fear. Glorfindel stared at Elladan's beautiful face and he couldn't contain himself anymore. He pulled Elladan into a hug and felt himself sobbing with relief and joy. ""Of course Dan, of course I do."" Dan kissed him swiftly, a very chaste kiss but it bore a promise of something more. ""Then I hope you can be patient? I am not really ready to do something….physical…for a while yet"" Glorfindel felt like weeping, he kissed Elladan's cheek, caressed his hair. ""Of course I can be patient, you decide this Dan. I will not touch you until you are ready for me, this I swear"" Dan leaned against the golden warrior and sighed, his eyes distant but also content. ""I made a very bad choice didn't I? But this time I know I have made the right one."" Glorfindel nodded. ""With Eru as a witness, I swear to you, I will never bring you anything but joy and pleasure."" Elladan let Glorfindel embrace him, closed his eyes. ""I know Fin, I know"" Some weeks later they received a note from Lothlorien, it was from Celeborn and he told that a group of the galadhrim under the command of Haldir the marchwarden had come across a horse running around with no rider. It had been wearing a saddle from Imladris and bore lord Elrond's brand. They had investigated further and then they found a small battlefield, there were some dead orcs and one dead elf and it appeared as if the ellon had been caught by surprise somehow, he hadn't tried to fight the orcs at first. But they had overpowered him and Celeborn wrote that he had been tortured to death, he had probably died very slowly and under extreme agony for the marks on the body were gruesome. They also sent the pouch the rider had been carrying and some of his stuff and it was no doubt. Avanwar had met his fate and it was such a well deserved one. He hadn't been held as high in regard as he believed, the orcs hadn't hesitated when they saw a lone elf and they didn't speak sindarin so they didn't understand that he was an ally. Orc's have never been accused of having too much intelligence and they had acted the way they used to, regardless of who the elf claimed to be serving. Elrond told everybody of the letter and Elrohir felt that his brother in fact had been avenged in a way, at least Avanwar wouldn't become a problem again and he had probably never had gotten to deliver his message either. They were in high alert for a while but the number of attacks did decrease with nobody on the inside, giving away the weak spots and things returned to normal. Both Elladan and Elrohir had problems as a result of what happened but they were strong and helped each other. Then one morning about a year after Elrohir walked into Elladan's rooms to get a cloak he had forgotten there the day after and found his brother sleeping soundly in the arms of the balrogslayer. Both looked very content and very happy and Elrohir smiled from the sight and there was much love and tenderness in that smile.

Carlisle tried as he took a deep breath and tried to think of a way to explain their situation, ""It seems that we have a problem with Alice."" The shifter's all looked over towards the psychic in unison and even though their expressions weren't very telling they made enough noises to make it clear that they were confused. They could tell that something was wrong with her; it would take a complete moron to not realize that there was something wrong with her. Her skin looked so much paler than normal and her eyes were glassy and vacant while she stood there completely still, like a sculpture of some sort. They know that vampires don't need to move or breathe, but the Cullens always either blinked their eyes or breathed whenever they saw them so seeing Alice stand so absolutely still was a little unnerving. Paul growled. Sam gave the wolf a sharp look causing him to immediately quiet down before he spoke, ""What's wrong with her?"" ""Actually we're not sure."" ""You're not sure?"" ""Alice had a vision, two days ago after the wedding. We don't know what the vision was about since it seemed to upset her so much that she became hysterical and we couldn't make out a word of what she was saying. All we do know is that it had something to do with you, or rather the pack."" Carlisle explained and Sam frowned, ""I thought you said she couldn't see us?"" ""She can't, or rather she shouldn't be able to see you."" ""Then how can you be sure this vision had anything to do with the pack?"" ""Well for one thing, she kept saying your names, some of them at least; Seth, Jacob and Embry."" The doctor explained and Seth was visibly shocked as the sandy wolf stepped back while Embry seemed to blink in surprise. ""Over and over again for hours until she just stopped."" The alpha looked over at Alice and his eyes filled with confusion, ""And exactly how were you expecting us to help you?"" Carlisle took a deep breath, ""From what I could gather from Alice's episode, the vision she had was of Embry dying-"" Embry tensed visibly while the rest of the wolves growled, Sam stepped forward with a dark glare, ""He-… dies from what exactly?"" ""I don't know, but we were hoping that Embry could help us."" Carlisle said as he looked over towards the silver spotted wolf and Emmett suddenly spoke as well unable to contain himself as the standoff continued, ""She thinks you're dead. All you need to do is show her you're alive, if you do that she might snap out of whatever trance she's in."" Embry's head snapped over towards his alpha just as Sam growled, ""So what you think one of my wolves had something to do with your daughter's freak out?"" ""We don't know."" Carlisle said clearly, ""We don't know what is going on, but we're desperate and we're willing to do whatever's necessary to bring Alice back."" Sam stayed silent for a moment and a rumble of noise rose among the shifters, Jasper's arm tightened around Alice's shoulder before he spoke looking Embry dead in the eye, ""Please, all we're asking for is for you to try."" Embry held that gaze for a moment more before turning back and walking into the line of trees. The wolves growled at him as he went before he returned a few moments later, pulling up his cut offs and Sam growled in warning, ""Embry."" The Quileute froze for the briefest of moments, ""They need help, something's wrong with her Sam we can all see that. Can't I just try?"" The alpha let out a heavy sigh, ""Be careful."" Embry stepped forward and his nose seemed to wrinkle in distaste as he neared the vampires, Jasper tensed up for the briefest of moments as the boy approached but forced himself to release her and step back when Embry stopped in front of them. The shifter paused for the moment completely unsure of exactly what he was meant to do. ""So how do I do this exactly? I mean, I'm already standing right here. Can't she see me?"" Carlisle moved closer with a frown and Embry's head gave a tilt as he stared down at the smaller pixie like girl, ""Uhm Hello? A-… Alice?"" Rosalie gave an exasperated sigh, as if she it took everything she had just to get the words out, ""Try touching her."" ""Oh, right."" Embry said and a light blush spread over his cheeks in embarrassment before he lifted his hand to touch the vampire's arm, only to hesitate just before he made contact. One more deep breath and he gently lay his hand on her cold skin. Suddenly Alice gasped and her eyes instantly cleared. The vampires all let out sighs of relief and Embry's head tilted a little more as he spoke, ""Alice?"" Alice looked up at the shifter in confusion until her eyes went wide and she immediately threw her arms around Embry's neck and the shifter went completely tense. Sam growled and the rest of the shifters started growling as well, exposing their teeth and raising their hackles when Alice spoke and all they could do is stare in confusion. ""Embry! I'm so sorry. You died and it was all my fault! It's all my fault. Please forgive me."" The pixie sobbed and Embry raised his arms up to awkwardly pat her back, ""Alice calm down. What's wron-"" Before Embry could finish his sentence the vampire suddenly turned her head and pressed her lips firmly against his. The entire clearing just froze and everything dropped into silence. Embry's eyes suddenly glazed over and he dropped down to his knees with Alice still holding onto him and Jasper's heart shattered. The End A/N: Yup The next one is called Redemption and it will be the last one-shot in this story. Please review."
221,0,4,0-FrankieQuinn13-4.txt,harry-potter,FrankieQuinn13,"he knew that Dumbledore was keeping from him but wouldn't tell him for some reason. Of course Harry was keeping a few secrets of his own. He'd been holding back over the past few months, it was mostly due to the fact that he was getting sick and tired of the entire Hogwarts student body staring at him like he was some kind of infallible Greek god and really didn't want to give anyone any more reason to go traipsing along after him like a pack of stray puppies begging for scraps. When Harry first arrived at Hogwarts he was excited to finally have a place where he fit in, where he could feel normal and not like a freak of nature the way that his aunt and uncle treat him. Instead he was treated like a celebrity, which was actually worse since there were all these expectations he was suddenly had to meet. So when he did start getting stronger Harry tried to hide it as best as he could. He spent months in the library going through every book he could find until he finally found a method that would help him keep his secret. It worked so well that even Snape didn't notice a thing. Although, at the time, Harry still had an immense amount of respect for Dumbledore so he never once thought of betraying the man. Harry just wanted to feel normal for once in his life. But now, to have Ron's memories erased and suppress his abilities? Harry wasn't sure what to think anymore. When Ron got out of the infirmary Harry tried to tell his friend the truth, but of course Ron didn't believe him. It wasn't until later, after Sirius escaped from Azkaban and they saw Remus transform under the light of the full moon for the very first time that it happened again. The charms broke all over again, apparently Ron had been getting a lot stronger than both Molly and Dumbledore had realized and this time Ron didn't pass out. Just stared down at his hands and marveled at the bright purple flames that burned on them without causing any actual damage before looking up at his best friend, at a complete loss for words since he finally realized that Harry was right. It took a little longer for Ron to learn to hide his abilities from both his family and headmaster, many many weeks of checking his temper and making sure that he didn't accidentally set anything on fire and in that time both he and Harry became disenchanted with Dumbledore and all of his teachings. Ron's attention shifted from Hermione to Blaise and they both became disgusted with their own dorm; the supposed great and noble Gryffindor house. Gryffindor, the great lion's den, where they claim to be unbiased and accepting of all they meet except of course if you just so happen to be sorted into Slytherin. In which case you're a racist, self-centered evil cur and will therefore be treated like one. Harry resisted the urge to growl at the thought. Merlin they have no idea. None of them have any idea how hard it is for Slytherin students in this school, they put up a good front and never allowed themselves to show so much of an ounce of weakness, but of course Harry knew the truth and so did Ron. Of course Harry's the one that actually had firsthand experience in that. That happened a few months ago, when Dumbledore sent him on a mission he believed that only Harry could accomplish and the boy went. At the time Harry still had some hope left that his headmaster really wasn't as bad as he thought he was. That there was indeed a reason for the things he did and the secrets he kept. Then he went on the mission and he finally saw Albus Dumbledore for what he truly was. But you know what's funny? Despite what happened and all that changed because of that one mission, Harry didn't regret a bit of it. After all, if he hadn't gone on the mission… well saying that he wouldn't have had a snowballs chance in hell at having Severus would be the understatement of the year. Xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Severus kept his head down as he made his way down the empty hallway. Dinner was still going in the Great hall, but there was a book on charms that he needed to get from the library and the slytherin knew that he'd end up missing curfew if he wasted too much time at dinner. So he ate a few bites of food, if only so Liam wouldn't go whining about him missing a meal yet again before heading out. The raven's face caught in a light blush and his lips twitched up in a smile as he thought of the older boy when he suddenly walked right into someone and he went tumbling into the ground. Severus hissed at the slight ache of pain caused by the collision, cursing himself for being so wrapped up in his own thoughts that he didn't see someone coming when the figure he walked into suddenly spoke. ""And just where do you think you're going Snivelly?"" Severus let out a low hiss of annoyance when his head snapped up and he found himself faced with James Bloody Potter. A/N: Yeah, only two chapters. The idea behind this is basically like, it's a continuation of this other thing of one-shots I did called Werewolf chronicles so it basically would've been the third chapter of that one but at the same time like a prequel to the alliance. Honestly though you can take it any way you like. In case you haven't noticed it is a timetravel fic, I've been writing a timetravel fic for Severus and Sirius but that one's really complicated so I haven't posted it yet. But this is a fun idea so I just went with it. Please review"

""The car was nice I really needed it and blondie told me it was a second hand, which makes me feel a little better about taking it."" The shifter took a deep breath, ""And the clothes were shortie's idea, she would have bought them if you hadn't and killed me for not accepting them. I get that you Cullens have a weird thing for spending money on people you like but-"" ""But what?"" The vampire asked as he edged a little closer while his frown deepened. ""But, Jesus, Edward the watches, all the other clothes, the ipods and tablet and laptop, the cellphones, the bikes and now a fucking house?!"" ""What's wrong with that?"" Jacob shut his eyes and gave another sigh, ""Look I know you're not trying to but from the outside, from someone else's perspective, it looks like you're trying to buy me."" ""I'm not trying to buy you."" Yes he is. ""You don't think that's what I'm trying to do, do you Jake?"" Edward reached out to tuck a lock of hair behind Jacob's ear and the shifter absently knocked his hand away as he walked back across the room. ""Knock it off."" The vampire almost growled in frustration when Jacob turned back to face him. ""You and I both know you're not trying to buy me because you have Bella and you're really generous for some reason. But that's not how it looks to everyone else."" Edward sighed as he shoved his hands in his pockets, ""And how does it look to everyone else?"" ""Like...like you're-"" The vampire arched a brow at the shifter when a dark blush started spreading over his face and Edward almost laughed at the memory he got. ""Jakey's got a sugar daddy."" Leah teased as she gave a lecherous grin when Paul suddenly spoke beside her. ""Aw c'mon Leah, maybe he just has a thing for older guys"" ""Much older guys."" ""At least he's not on a respirator."" Quil commented casually. ""Hey Jake you think you could get Daddy to buy me a car too?"" ""Can you imagine what he had to do for the first one, c'mon Leah don't torture him he needs to have some tricks so he can get some of the good stuff later on."" Oh the pack has been brutal. ""See what I mean!"" Jacob growled in frustration. ""Everyone has noticed this, whatever this is. And now you went and got me a house. I don't get it, exactly what's going on here Edward?"" ""Nothing."" Yeah right. ""Right."" Jacob rubbed his temples in exasperation, ""O.K, look I don't think we should be around each other anymore."" Edward's eyes widened, ""What-"" ""I'm not keeping the house and you can't make me sign the deed. I'll have all the other stuff sent back to you when I get the chance, but I'll pay you back for the car-"" ""Jake-"" ""No, Edward. Something about all this feels wrong so until you get a handel on whatever it is you're dealing with, I think it's better if you stay away from me. If Bella has a problem with it then just tell her to call me and I'll tell her myself."" Jacob turned to leave the room when two cold hard arms wrapped around his waist, the shifter jumped in surprise but recovered quickly as he tried to pry Edward's hands away. ""Damn it leech, I thought we had this conversation about not touching me!"" ""I'm not trying to buy you Jacob,"" Edward said softly against Jacob's ear making the shifter flush at the intimate contact. ""I just want to take care of you."" ""Edward-"" ""Who cares about what anyone else says anyway, you're precious to me Jacob and I always try to take care of things that are precious."" ""Precious?"" Jacob repeated in a flat tone making Edward give a low breathy chuckle that sent an involuntary shiver down his spine. ""You're important to me and not just because of Bella either."" ""I don't need you to take care of me, I can take care of myself-"" ""You've been doing it for years."" Edward finished, ""But Jacob don't you want someone else to take care of you for once. Aren't you tired of always fighting for yourself and everyone else, never being thought of first always helping when no one helps you."" Jacob paused as he took in the vampires words, completely missing the hand that slipped off of his waist up to his neck to brush his hair away from his left ear and neck. ""I can do that for you Jacob. I'll take care of you, I'll protect you. You'll never have to worry about anything again."" The shifter gulped as he tried to reach out for some of that defiance that was slowly slipping away, ""And you'll do it for free, out of the goodness of you stone cold heart."" Edward paused as his eyes flickered up the side of Jacob's face, ""I won't ask for anything you don't want to give."" ""I don't have anything to give."" ""Yes you do, just give in Jacob."" Edward breathed causing his breath to ghost out over the shifters skin while his own body thrummed in content at being so close to Jacob's heated frame. ""Just give in and I'll take care of everything."" Jacob gulped once again, ""Give into what?"" Edward placed a kiss on the side of Jacob's neck, instantly making the wolf tense. ""Edward-"" ""Shhh, just relax."" The vampire cooed and Jacob took a shuddering breath as Edward moved up the side of his neck towards his ear, briefly nuzzling his nose into his hair to take in the scent that smelled better at close range. While his hands slowly tugged off Jacob's jacket and tossed it onto the floor before letting his right hand roam across his chest while the left reached up to the door and slammed it shut.

223,0,0,0-FrankieQuinn13-0.txt,harry-potter,FrankieQuinn13,"them have ever seen before so they just let him be. These days it was easier just letting James have his space than trying to talk to him about anything so eventually they just stopped trying. Remus paused to look up at Sirius who was arguing loudly with Arthur Weasley, sitting across from him at the table while Peter snickered at their antics. The portly boy seemed fairly oblivious to James' sudden changes and never asked about them either, then again, Peter's been oddly absent as of late. He always had something to do elsewhere and since Peter never really seemed to contribute much to their little group ignoring his absences was easy. Sirius on the other hand was a different story completely. Despite the fact that the animagus put up a good act and never showed any signs of pressure, Remus could tell that he wasn't himself, that James' changes was effecting him as well. But there wasn't much they could do about it if James wouldn't talk about it. If he'd just tell them what was wrong, or if they could just get through to Snape for even a moment maybe they could find out what was wrong and help James get back to normal, but as things stood there wasn't much that they could do. It was right then that Remus looked up over towards the Slytherin table and frowned when he didn't spot Snape anywhere near it. He wasn't in his usual spot beside Rosier, Mulciber and Wilkes or even sitting by himself near the far end of the table the way he sometimes did during meals. The Slytherin was nowhere in sight and Remus frowned when the doors to the great hall suddenly opened and he looked up to see a sight so shocking, that the other students that caught sight of it immediately paused and stared in confusion. ""Prongs?"" Sirius asked as he looked up at the two quickly making their way across the hall. James walked into the great hall in a hurry, almost running as he dragged a lankier raven haired teen along behind him. The entire hall gradually quieted down from its loud chatter that started at the beginning of dinner to just stare as the Gryffindor captain dragged Severus Snape along behind him, his hand was locked tight around the raven's wrist as he made a beeline for the table where the teachers usually sat at the front of the hall. It seemed like Snape was trying to get away from the other as he repeatedly tugged on the hand around his wrist and tried to stop multiple times, growling and hissing at the hazel eyed wizard all while James just continued to drag him forward. The professors immediately took note of them with Dumbledore frowning at the two while professor McGonagall immediately got up from her seat and scolded ""Mr. Potter! What is the meaning of this?!"" James stopped in front of his professors and the students watched in anticipation as they waited to see what would happen next. Snape tried to yank out of James' grip again only for the other to grab a tighter hold of him, pulling the Slytherin into his side with one arm around his waist. Snape seemed to hiss something at the other, only this time there was no glare in his eyes, only a pleading stare as he tried to tug out of his grip again. James seemed to swallow hard as he stared into the Snape's eyes when McGonagall spoke again. ""Mr. Potter. I don't take kindly to being ignored. Now let go of Mr. Snape this instant."" James looked up at the woman and his eyes hardened in determination as he spoke, ""No."" ""No?"" McGonagall asked incredulously and James could see her eyes narrow down into a glare about to unleash all her fury on him but he spoke first. ""I have a request to ask of the head master."" ""And this couldn't wait until after dinner? Without Mr. Snape's presence."" Slughorn suddenly asked and James eyes flickered over to the man for a moment before looking back to fix his gaze on the headmaster, ""N-No… no it can't."" The transfigurations professor opened her mouth to speak only for the headmaster to speak before her. ""It's quite alright, Minerva. It seems the boy has something important to say."" The man said with a small smile, setting his goblet down as he laced his fingers together before putting his joined hands on the table, ""Exactly what request would you like to make Mr. Potter."" ""James, please don't…"" Snape whispered, but with the hall being so quiet the words carried over across the room and many frowned at the Slytherin's choice of words. Remus and Sirius watched in complete and total utter confusion as James looked down at Snape again before Dumbledore spoke again. ""Mr. Potter?"" ""I-…"" James cut himself off as he took a deep breath staring into Snape's eyes before he let go of the teen and stepped forward with his shoulders squared, feet apart and chin up as he spoke loud enough everyone in the room to hear perfectly clear. ""I wish to be resorted."" Remus's eyes went wide and Sirius gaped, the entire hall seemed to fall into an even more pronounced silence than before, almost as if not a single soul were breathing while Dumbledore stared at the teen in shock and McGonagall couldn't help but stutter out. ""I-I beg your pardon?"" ""I want to be resorted."" James said clearly without so much as a blink of an eye, ""Right now."" It was then that Sirius suddenly shot up from his seat and screamed, ""ARE YOU INSANE?!"" And just as quickly as it had dropped into silence, the entire hall suddenly rose in a roar. A/N: Again this is an experiment. I'm working on something, but I want to see how this works out first. Tell me what you think so far. Till next time. Please review."

The fact that you're ready to move on, proves how strong you are and I envy that, so here."" Jacob took the bat as he just stared at the girl, ""He's an asshole and he totally broke your heart. It's only fair that you return the favor."" ""You realize that this is a felony right?"" Bella looked at the man for a moment before bending over to pick up the wooden Louis Ville slugger he still had beside his feet, turning towards the car and taking a deep breath as she wrapped both hands around the bat and swung but only managed a slight dent that caused Jacob to laugh. ""This is harder than I thought."" Jacob gave her an indulgent smile, ""Swing with you whole body, you know put your back into it."" ""O.K."" Bella said again before trying again, this time swinging hard and getting a much bigger dent in the side of the car before swinging again and again and got a little carried away. Jacob joined in at some point but Bella barely even noticed, even when one of the headlights shattered before the other did the same and the car alarm started ringing in distress. She was long gone. The car just looked so much like Edward's and Bella hadn't realized just how angry and frustrated she was at his behavior. It wasn't just the gifts and one or two missed dates. It was dozens of missed dates, complete disappearances where he didn't pick up his phone or answer her texts before just brushing her off when she asked him about it later. It was months of him being distracted with just…other things and meetings that just came out of nowhere. It was the pitying looks his sister Alice would give him and the angry glares she'd catch Emmett giving him. It was the fact that she knew she wouldn't leave despite it all because she loved him. The girl was panting hard by the time she stopped and stepped back collapsing onto the soaked asphalt as the car continued to beep in distress while the lights were out completely. The hood of her jacket had slipped off and her hair was soaked while her makeup ran down her face. Giving a snort when Jacob dug the key from the Volvo into the top of the car. Bella cringed as the sound cut through the rain before he tossed them at the broken windscreen and plopped down on the ground beside her purse which she hadn't noticed fall before. ""Not bad."" Jacob said glancing at the bat in Bella's hand and the girl paused when she realized that the thing broke at some point and she was just holding onto the handle before she tossed it aside. ""Thanks."" The girl said as she made to get up only to slip before Jacob stood up along beside her and she grabbed her arm to help her up. Bella was surprised when she was suddenly pulled into a tight embrace. ""Thank you."" The girl smiled as she wrapped her arms around Jacob, ""You're welcome."" The raven pulled back as he looked at her running makeup and gave a wry smile, ""Sorry about this, I'm starting to realize I spoiled a date."" Bella waved him off, ""It's fine, don't worry about it."" ""I should probably get going."" Jacob said as he pulled his phone out of his pocket and Bella moved forward, squinting to see what Jacob had written on the hood. It read E.C+J.B with a heart around it but with a big ""x"" drawn over it. ""E.C."" Jacob shook his head, ""I carved that on a tree near where my dad's house. Edward Cullen+Jacob Black. I'm cutting it down first chance I get."" Bella froze. ""We should probably go. Thanks again Bella for everything."" Jacob said as he started walking away glancing back at the girl briefly, ""And that boyfriend of yours, I hope he treats you right."" Jacob walked away, disappearing across the road and Bella thinks she might have been out there long enough to see him wait for a car and get inside before it took off. She isn't really sure. The rain was still falling, and the car was still beeping in distress, but at some point she made it to the restaurant's doors. She didn't react until the maître d' spoke and brought her back to reality. ""Miss… Miss! Are you alright?!"" Bella just stared at him before she asked, ""Cullen, table for two."" ""Oh yes, Mr. Cullen is already inside but miss-"" Bella ignored him as she walked into the dining area where the people sitting at the tables looked up at her and immediately started whispering. She caught sight of Edward at a table across the room. The bronze haired man looked up at the commotion when his eyes went wide at the sight of her and got up to immediately rushed over to her. ""Bella, what on earth happened to you? Are you alright?"" Bella just stared at him as he reached out to touch her face and brush her hair aside. ""Bella? What happened?"" Bella took Edward's hand and pressed the broken handle of the baseball bat into his hand before she shrugged out of his grasp and walked away. Xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx ""Are you going to tell me what you were doing in the pouring rain?"" Jacob just looked up at the blonde when they pulled up at a red light from his spot in the passenger seat, before he quickly leaned over to turn the blonde's head and pressed a kiss on his lips.

You're the one that promised the Capitol a show. So if the sponsors want a brute and his sweet little mate then that's exactly what we're going to give them, isn't that right?"" ""Y-Yes."" Peeta rasped out still having difficulty breathing when Cato suddenly leaned in and pressed a bruising kiss on his lips causing the shorter tribute's eyes to go wider than before as he just stopped breathing all together in his shock, before Cato pulled back completely a moment later, stepping over to the console on the side of the elevator doors to release the emergency breaks and hit the button to the second floor and another for the twelfth while Peeta just stayed planted against the wall. The doors slipped open in no time and Cato glanced back at the teen before giving a snort as he left the cubicle. ""I'll see you later, lover boy."" The doors slipped shut and Peeta stayed right where he was until the doors slipped open mere moments later and he forced himself to stumble out leaning against the wall beside the carriage to slide down to the floor as he finally convinced his lungs to start breathing again and he started panting. Taking a moment to wonder what on earth he'd gotten himself into as he lifted a hand to touch his lips. xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx The next morning Cato was in a foul mood. He hadn't been able to sleep much before one of the Avox's came into his room to wake him up for breakfast and training. He couldn't stop thinking about what happened the day before, because so much happened the day before and all because of some nobody from shitty district twelve. Surprisingly enough the one thing that bothered Cato the most about the day before was the kiss. He didn't know why he did it, it was just an impulse. Peeta was already rattled but Cato wanted to do something that would push the other tribute just that much closer to the edge, something that would make Peeta understand loud and clear that he wasn't the one in control anymore, he wasn't in charge. Cato was. So he kissed him and now the stupid kiss won't leave him the hell alone. After taking a shower and getting dressed, the tribute sat down at the table in the dining room just as an Avox walked into the room to start laying out his breakfast. Clove was already in her spot eating a fruit salad and stabbing at the pieces like they'd done her personal wrong. Cato arched a brow at the girl, ""What's with you?"" Clove sneered at him hatefully, a look that made Cato pause for a moment in confusion as she spoke, ""I see you didn't waste any time sneaking around with your little boyfriend. You already have Caesar and Geraldine buzzing about you and it isn't even nine o'clock yet."" ""What?"" Clove turned on the live stream in the dining room with the remote sitting near the pitcher of juice near the center of the table before slamming it back down onto its surface, Cato looked up to see Caesar and Geraldine sitting in their seats in front of a screen that seemed to be playing some kind of clip in the background. "" Now in this exclusive surveillance footage we can see Cato grab Peeta and enter the elevator, from the time stamp we see that they spent quite some time in there and the reports we got from the building's maintenance crew is that the emergency break in the elevator was tripped."" Caesar explained excitedly while Geraldine said slyly, ""Oh I can only imagine what they were up to."" The audience laughed while Caesar nodded before he continued and the footage played on, ""Then some time later Cato emerges from the elevator pausing to say something to its occupant before stepping out-"" "" Looking very pleased with himself."" "" Before the elevator keeps moving and we can see from the footage here that it stops at the penthouse floor where district twelve is staying for the games. Peeta comes stumbling out and sags against the wall down to the floor… Geraldine, what do you make of this?"" "" Me?"" the woman asked with a slight shrug, ""I'd say I'm surprised Cato hasn't locked Peeta in his room yet and tied him to his bed. Did you see that possessive lust, the clear passion that they have for one another? Cato clearly couldn't keep his hands to himself and Peeta well, Cato seemed to leave him absolutely breathless and weak at the knees. Really, I have a feeling that there will be fireworks on the day of the games. If they're already so passionate around each other now, what do you think will happen once they start the game and are forced to fight for survival in the secluded dark night under the stars? I think it will be explosive."" ""Explosive? What the hell does that mean?"" ""It means they expect you two to go at it like rabbits once the sun goes down in the arena."" Clove hissed out before just dumping her fork into her bowl and standing up from her chair. ""I've lost my appetite."" Cato just watched her go as the Avox returned with the rest of his breakfast and he let out a heavy sigh. What's he gotten himself into? A/N: You guys know that movie the Starving games right?

They set up the new wards working as quickly as possible while still managing to make them strong enough to keep any unwanted guests at bay in case any more Death eaters decided to show up on their doorstep. In a move that admittedly surprised even Molly herself, she agreed to Arthur's suggestion that the wards keep out any and all intruders, whether they were light or dark. Including Albus Dumbledore, she wasn't sure why, but she knew that Albus couldn't find out about this, not if they were all going to stay at least moderately safe. On the way back to the house both Arthur and Bill drilled her on what was going on and why the Lestrange brothers were taking up residence in their house. Molly just sighed and said that she couldn't turn Lee away. Surprisingly enough Arthur smiled and they quickly made their way back to try and get some answers from Lee instead. Only when they got back the house was quiet, with nothing more than Lee's sobs filling the otherwise silent house. As they made their way up the stairs towards the attic where the twins used to sleep they found various members of their family standing around the door with shocked expressions. Arthur frowned as he paused beside Fred to ask, ""What's wrong?"" Shockingly enough the twin was rendered speechless as George just pointed into the room. Ron stood by the door with Blaise standing beside the teen with his arms around the redhead and they both just stared at the two on the floor in the center of the room. Harry was on his knees, with a strange looking book lying open beside him as he let out heavy panting breaths. Lee was on the ground with him. He had his arms wrapped tight around the younger man's neck as he cried and sobbed into his neck. ""Thank you Harry, thank you so much."" ""What's going on?"" Molly asked as she entered the room giving Ron and Blaise a glance causing the redhead to look away before she let out a soft sigh and looked over towards the beds. Rodolphus lay on the one to the right and Rabastan on the left. Dudley seemed to be at Rabastan's side, healing his many cuts and bruises while Alexis stood leaning over Rodolphus as she inspected his left arm carefully. ""Incredible."" The woman said in wonder as she dropped the man's hand and rushed over to Rabastan to inspect his arm as well, causing Dudley to pause as he just watched her. Molly's frown deepened, ""Zabini what-"" ""The marks… they're gone."" Lady Zabini said softly before she stood up straight to turn towards the others. ""Harry got rid of them… he removed the dark marks."" Molly's eyes went wide. So much can change in six months. But what changes isn't what's important. What's important is how it starts. One event leads to another which leads to another and so forth and so forth. A chain reaction of unforeseeable events This chain in particular started with a simple ride on a broom. ""Relax."" Ron blushed at the deep sultry voice that spoke against his ear, silently praying that the Slytherin standing right behind him couldn't see the red that was slowly spreading over his face. The redhead took a deep breath of the cool night air and wrapped his hands around the broom he stood over as he cursed himself for agreeing to do this in the first place. He bit back a squeak as two arms went around him from behind while a hard chest pressed against his back to hold the front of the broom. Ron tried to ignore the heat of the other body that was slowly seeping through his clothes and into his skin while warm breath brushed up against his neck, making the redhead curse himself some more for agreeing to get on a broom with Blaise Zabini of all people. ""Tell me again why it is that I have to sit on the front."" Ron growled in annoyance when Blaise suddenly moved forward and spoke right against his ear, resulting in an involuntary shiver to go speeding down his spine. ""Because I drive better from behind."" Ron's blush instantly darkened at that and he was about to tell Zabini off when the Slytherin suddenly kicked off the ground and they went shooting up into the sky. The night was not going the way he'd planned at all. He was just going to go outside the castle, get some fresh air and clear his head. That's all. How on earth did things get so screwed up?! A/N: So just to give you guys a heads up so far the pairings are like this: Ron/Blaise, Rodolphus/Lee/Rabastan, Harry/Severus (Top Harry/bottom Severus, cause that's how I roll), Luna/Theo, Pansy/Neville, Viktor/Dudley, later Charlie/Dudley, Sirius/Arthur (maybe) However these pairings may change at a later date Haven't decided on what I'm going to do with Remus, Lucius, Narcissa, Draco, Percy, the twins, Bill and Fleur yet. The next chapters are not going to be as long as this one, this was just the intro. Anyway please review"

His eyes went wide when he saw no one but himself, looking like he was hugging air in the reflection. Edwards wasn't there and neither was the reflection of anyone else in the room. ""Oh my-"" ""Don't we make a lovely couple?"" Edward teased with a wistful smile before moving forward. With Jacob's wide eyes staring back at the vampire just as he removed his mask and tossed it aside before slipping off the wolf's mask along with the tie holding his hair in place. ""I've been waiting centuries to find you Jacob."" Edward said as his eyes slipped into heartache while one of his arms went around Jacob's waist and the other went around the wolf's neck beneath his hair. ""I've been so terribly lonely, going year after year, decade after decade without the one who was meant to be my other half. Now, that I've found you. I refuse to let you go."" The next moment Jacob let out a grunt of surprise when the vampire locked their lips in a kiss moving his lips against Jacob's and pulling a moan from the wolf's throat as the hand on his neck slipped into his hair. Jacob couldn't help but sigh as the vampire gained access to his mouth and the pleasurable feeling of the passionate kiss went straight to his head. Before he kissed back, making the concious decision to wrap his arms tighter around Edwards neck and letting out a low moan as he did. All while his blood raged with heat and his wolf seemed to whimper from some unknown cause. The vampire suddenly pulled away, making Jacob gasp as his head was pulled back and to the side to expose his neck and one of Jacob's hands slipped down across Edward's chest, his eyes widened for a moment as he noticed a silver diamond wedding band that wasn't there before. ""You have no heartbeat."" ""Perhaps it just needs to be rekindled."" Edward breathed as he pulled back and Jacob watched in strange fascination as the vampire threw his head back, his jaw unhinged and elongated while his eyes flashed gold and sharp fangs grew in his mouth. In that brief moment Jacob almost hoped that Edward would do it, that the vampire would take away the pain and make them be together forever. But that's not what happened next. Although Jacob isn't really sure what happened next. He heard a howl and vicious growling, he felt Edward pull him up against his chest before loud crashes and screaming rang all around the room, before everything suddenly started moving in a blur. Air rushed passed his face ruffling his hair and making him feel dizzy until he suddenly wasn't moving anymore. ""Jacob! Jake, c'mon man snap out of it!"" Jacobs shook his head and groaned as the fog that clouded his mind suddenly lifted. The wolf opened his eyes and they started darting around him to find Paul in front of him while Sam, Leah, Jared and Embry stood panting all around him. Bloody and bruised as they tried to stay on their feet. ""Fuck what happened?!"" ""We had to force our transformations to get you outta there."" Paul said seemingly oblivious to the cut bleeding out over his forehead. And Jacob lifted a hand to rake through his hair when the cold metal feeling around his finger caught his attention and he quickly pulled off the ring and threw it in some other corner of the forest. ""We need to get out of here."" Sam said as he and Jared braced themselves against each other while Embry and Leah did the same and Jacob moved to slide his arm around Paul's shoulders when a voice suddenly echoed around them. ""Jacob."" The wolves all tensed immediately moving to surround Jacob in a bruised and battered protective barrier. ""Where are you my sweet wolf? I know you're here somewhere."" Sam and Leah both growled, ready to force another transformation if they had to. ""Don't you remember when I said I'd take away the pain. Don't you want to be happy Jacob?"" Jacob took a deep breath trying to steady his nerves and calm his wolf which had started whining in his chest again. ""You're mine Jacob, nothing Sam or the rest of your pack does will ever change that. I will have you, before the full moon rises . You'll be where you belong, right by my side."" Jacob shivered at the threat that was given, ""Mark my words sweet wolf, you and I will be together forever."" The pack stayed silent as their eyes quickly scanned their surroundings, they sniffed the air and found the stench of undead faded a bit. Meaning the vampire had left. ""We need to move."" Sam said as he looked over the pack before his eyes fixed on Jacob, ""I told you to stay away from the Cullens and you disobeyed me! What the hell were you thinking Jacob?! Don't tell me you did it for Bella. Because then that means that fucking girl led you to your death!"" Jacob shrank back in submission at his alpha's command, ""You will never go near her again, is that clear?"" Jacob looked down at the ground as Edwards word came back to him. ""You don't need to worry about that, Isabella Swan doesn't exist as far as I'm concerned."" The pack's eyes widened a bit at that, wondering where this sudden change of heart came from when Jacob had been ready to die for Bella a few days ago, but no one made a comment. Leah stepped up to shoulder Sam while Paul walked with Jared and Embry gave Jacob a sympathetic smile as Jacob slipped his arm around his friends shoulders. All while ignoring the tug that kept pulling him back the way they came. The End A/N: open ending, but I like it. hope you liked it too Please review."

""He really does hate me doesn't he?"" James tried for a smile, ""If it makes you feel any better he probably hates me just as much as he hates you."" Sirius gave a snort, ""At least you still have Evans to fall back on."" ""You're hardly one to talk with all those girls you date."" ""That's different."" ""Different how?"" ""They aren't Snape."" James let out a sigh, ""Neither is Lily."" Sirius turned his head towards his friend, ""I'm sorry about what I said too and I suppose, I just thought that since you started dating Evans you were over him."" ""Well, it wasn't fair of me to try and hold onto him while I'm with her. Can't have everything I want can I?"" Sirius laughed as he looked back up at the ceiling, when James spoke again, ""Do you think I should break up with Lily?"" Sirius frowned, ""What on earth for?"" James blushed and Sirius let out a heavy sigh, ""Oh you have got to be kidding me? What happened to sticking to the promise?"" ""Well I was thinking, it might not be so bad sharing Snape, as long as it was just with you."" James said that last part quickly when Sirius' eyes went wide. ""You can't be serious."" ""Well I'm not but you are."" James said with a grin and Sirius couldn't help but let out another laugh this time groaning as it caused a pain to ache in his ribs, ""He'd never agree to that."" ""Won't know until we try. So how about it, shall we make a new deal?"" Sirius stared back at his best friend for a moment before a wide grin broke out over his face, ""Definitely."" ""Good, now I just need to figure out a way of breaking it off with Evans without upsetting Snape."" ""Wait."" Sirius started as he turned his head as far as it could go to face his friend, ""How is this going to work anyway? Do I get him Monday through Wednesdays and you get him the rest or-"" Just then the door to the medical wing opened and both wizards froze as a lanky, pale dark haired boy slowly walked into the room. The two almost flushed as the Slytherin looked up at them with an arched brow as he stepped into the room, before letting out a snort. ""I see your skills in potion making are finally paying off."" Sirius couldn't help but growl at the comment, ""Sod off, Snape."" Old habits die hard. James bit back a sigh, while Severus just smirked as he walked further into the room and stopped to stand between their beds where they were levitating, ""I have to say, I'm a little curious to know what it was that had depleted your attention span even more than usual. Some of the students seem to think that you were arguing over something. Trouble in paradise?"" Sirius paused as his flush got darker when James quickly spoke, ""You sound worried Snape, is that why you came in here; to check up on us? I have to say I'm touched."" Snape sneered, ""Don't flatter yourself Potter; I didn't come in here to grace myself with your presence."" ""Then why are you here?"" The Slytherin opened his mouth to speak when another voice suddenly came from the bed on the other side of the room that had its curtains drawn. ""Severus?"" a head of tawny blonde hair suddenly appeared behind the curtain and a very weak and sickly looking Remus appeared. Sirius' eyes went wide at the exact same time as James' when they suddenly remembered that the night before had been the night of the full moon and they totally missed it due to the accident. The marauders were about to apologize to their friend when something so shocking happened that they were both rendered speechless. ""What do you think you're doing you stupid dog?"" Snape hissed as he rushed over to Remus' side and caught him before he could stumble as he stepped forward carrying some of his weight as he pushed the curtains away with his free hand and helped Remus back into the bed. ""You're ill; you shouldn't be out of bed right now."" ""I heard your voice and I wanted to see you."" Remus said with a tired smile as Severus put his feet up on the bed and pulled the sheets up over the wolf, ""I missed you."" Snape did what James and Sirius used to think was impossible, when his cheeks suddenly flushed in a dark blush but still managed to glare as he eased the wolf back onto the bed, ""For all you claims that you're not a dog you certainly behave like one."" Remus frowned, ""Are you saying that you didn't miss me?"" Snape's blush went one shade darker and he just let out a frustrated sigh as he leaned down to press a lingering kiss on the werewolf's lips, ""There, does that answer your question?"" A beaming smile broke out on Remus' face, ""Not really, you should probably give me another just to be sure."" Severus rolled his eyes, ""Honestly, you're just as insufferable as your friends."" ""But you still love me more right?"" As the two continued James just stared at them at a complete loss for words until Sirius spoke, ""Did-Did we lose to Moony?"" James didn't know what to say, until Severus went down to pick up Remus' tie which had fallen off the side table beside the bed when the werewolf suddenly looked up at his friends and gave them a wink and the hazel eyed wizard couldn't help but gape. ""That sneaky bastard."" Severus stood back up and Remus' face became the picture of innocence when the other sat down on the bed beside him. ""He really is just like us.""

229,4,16,4-FrankieQuinn13-16.txt,twilight,FrankieQuinn13,"""About six months"" Six months is that all? Edward glanced at Rosalie who seemed to be quite absorbed in the video, but the blonde still managed to shrug. ""I don't know, but Alice seems pretty keen on you getting along with Jacob for some reason."" Rosalie grinned as she took her cell phone back, but not without a bit of reluctance from Edward. ""In fact. She's planning you and Jacob's wedding as we speak."" ""What?"" Edward looked back at the house and darted inside to find it empty with the exception of Esme who seemed to be happily preparing lunch for Jacob. When he heard Alice's voice in the back yard and he stepped out onto the porch. To his complete shock Alice was clinging to Jacob's arm as she prattled on while making directions with her free hand. Jacob seemed willing for the most part if not a little annoyed. 'This feels wonder-' ""Edward!"" Alice instantly chirped as she saw her brother and Jacob instantly tensed. 'Shit shit shit shit, fucking shit! Why'd he have to be here why can't he be somewhere with Bella. Damn it all to fucking hell-' Edward suppressed a grin at the shifter's panicked thoughts, when Alice spoke. ""You're just in time, I was just showing Jacob where we'll be having the ceremony. Oh it'll be so perfect You and Jacob-"" ""What?!"" Jacob screeched and Edward couldn't help but smirk. ""Edward and Bella."" Alice said innocently while Jacob just growled. ""You didn't say Bella."" ""Yes I did."" ""She said Bella."" ""Totally said Bella, dude."" Emmett and Jasper said as they quietly laughed to themselves and Edward shook his head at their antics. ""Oh, Edward could you please come over here for a second?"" Alice called and Edward walked over, slowly taking in the boy's appearance for the first time since they met. By the time Edward had made it towards them, the vampire had to admit, Jacob is beautiful. ""Jacob."" ""Leech."" Jacob growled in response but Edward knew not to take it too personally what with the shifter's internal break down and all. ""Come along."" Alice said as she grabbed Edward's hand and dragged them both towards the end of the garden and positioned them in front of each other. ""You, here and you here."" The pixie stepped back so she could take in the whole picture before she let out a squeal of delight. ""Oooh its going to be so perfect!"" ""Rosalie Esme, come look at this."" While Alice was off in wedding Lala land Edward decided to take a peek into Jacob's thought and had to keep his composure as a very interesting image filled his mind. Jacob was on the ground moaning and groaning loudly while his arms remained restrained above his head. Edward was on the shifter's neck nipping and sucking at the sensitive flesh while he thrusted into the shifters body, making him scream. ""Edward!"" 'Shit shit shit- shut up shut up shut up! He's a mind reader you idiot! God, I hope he didn't see that' Jacob glanced up at Edward who had discreetly moved his gaze elsewhere and Jacob opened his mouth in a slight sigh. 'Good, I don't think I'd survive if he knew I- Fuck I can't believe I actually fingered myself to Edward fucking Cullen' Edward couldn't believe it either, but he can't say he doesn't approve. 'Damn but it felt so goo-Shut up!' Jacob mentally slapped himself and Edward had to try hard not to smile. 'Think of something else, anything else, O.K: A, B, C, D, E,...' As Jacob started reciting the alphabet, Edward realised that he's never had this much fun listening to someone else's thoughts before or been as fascinated with guessing what Bella was thinking before. Wait Is he getting cold feet? Because of Jacob? ""Edward turn towards Jacob and take his left hand I want to see what it'll look like on the wedding day."" Alice said with a tilt of her head and her eyebrows knit together in concentration. ""What?! Hell no, I'm not letting this parasite touch me. Why can't you do it?"" Jacob growled as he stepped away from Edward and Alice gave a pout. ""Because you're already standing there, c'mon Jakey just five seconds so we can see."" Rosalie called from the porch beside Esme, ""If he contaminates you with some hideous disease then I'll personally take you shopping for some new car parts."" Jacob hissed, ""The rabbit isn't cheap you know and stop calling me Jakey!"" Rosalie scoffed, ""Could've fooled me. C'mon pup just do it."" Jacob gave a sigh and placed his left hand in Edward's, making them both gasp from the contact. Edward was amazed at how the shifters heat flowed through him and Jacob almost let out a breath at touching Edward before looking up into his eyes. 'R, S, T, U... U...' Jacob felt himself get lost in Edward's eyes and instantly felt himself blush, 'shit what comes after U?' ""V."" Edward answered as Jacob's eyes had him just as entranced. 'V, W- wait' ""Stay out of my head leech!"" Jacob growled as he ripped his hand out of Edward's and turned to stomp back into the house. ""I'm outta here."" ""But Jake you can't go."" Alice whined. ""Yes I can."" Jacob snarled as he walked away when Esme suddenly appeared in front of him and gave him a motherly smile that had him blushing in guilt. ""Now, Jacob you can't leave yet. I never get to cook since no one around here can eat it and I just made lunch. I'd love for you to try it."" ""I-"" ""Please."" Jacob suppressed a groan, ""O.K."" ""Great!"" Esme said as she took Jacob's hand and led him inside while Edward stayed staring at the shifter until Alice suddenly appeared beside him. ""Edward."" Edward looked down at the pixie and found a beaming smile on her face. ""The wedding is going to be perfect."" The End. A/N: Frankie's done! Please review."

While various sensations can be felt during sexual intercourse regardless of how underdeveloped you may be, an over-abundance in size can cause quite a few problems that can lead to pain and severe damage to your partner. In such cases lubrication is recommended to decrease the chances of any over stretching or tearing that might appear."" Carlisle almost groaned when one of his children raised their hands again. ""Yes, Emmett?"" ""Is there a limit to how many times you can have sex?"" The doctor took a deep breath wondering why Emmett of all people would ask that question but he still answered if only to help those who really needed to know, ""There's no set limit to the amount of times you can have sex,"" Carlisle blinked when Emmett grinned and turned towards the shifters as he mouthed, 'I told you so' to Embry causing the wolf to roll his eyes while the doctor continued. ""But I would advise not to over exert yourself. Sex is a highly demanding physical activity and as such I must remind you all that caution is key."" The doctor almost squeaked when his other daughter raised her hand, ""Alice?"" ""You didn't go over lesbian sex either."" ""Uhghm."" Carlisle cleared his throat and spoke, ""Well lesbian sex which is sexual intercourse between two women and has certain limitations but there are effective methods of copulation such as oral sex and mutual stimulation through masturbation and the usage of sexual props which serve as effective ways for release."" ""Ms. Clearwater?"" ""Are contraceptives necessary for that too?"" ""Birth control methods aren't necessary for obvious reasons however the usage of condoms over sexual props and female condoms are always encouraged."" Embry raised his hand next and Carlisle took a deep breath, he doesn't know the shifter very well but from what he could tell the boy was shy and somewhat reserved meaning anything he was willing to ask in front of a crowded gym had to be important. ""Mr. Call?"" ""What about kinks?"" Carlisle almost gaped, ""Kinks?"" ""Yeah like bondage and stuff."" The hall broke out into snickers while Embry blushed furiously and Emmett seemed to be wearing a smug grin on his face. ""Is it normal to be into that?"" ""Well,"" Carlisle breathed, ""We all have different methods of pre penetrational stimulation, or rather foreplay as it's commonly referred to, to increase the amount of pleasure during the sexual process. Acts like bondage and role-play are perfectly normal as long as both parties involved are consenting and these different stimulations are conducted safely."" Embry gave a nod and ducked his head down while Quil kept nudging him with a knowing smile when Jacob's hand went up, albeit a bit reluctantly. ""Yes, mr. Black?"" ""What about... bloodplay ?"" Carlisle paled considerably as he was thrown for a complete loop, ""What?"" All eyes turned on the shifter, most of them were shocked and surprised and some of the students started whispering among themselves while Edward's eyes fixed on Jacob and the vampires bright gold eyes started to darken. Jacob gave a heavy sigh while a dark blush spread all the way up to the tips of his ears. ""I said bloodplay, is there a way to do that safely."" Carlisle's mouth fell open in a gape and it took a moment for the doctor to pull himself together enough to answer. ""Well, bloodplay is an incredibly dangerous method of foreplay mr. Black, I'll need you to understand that quite clearly. There are countless diseases and infections sexual or otherwise that can be contracted through this act. But with caution, and I do mean extreme caution , it can be done safely. Provided you and your partner are completely trusting of one another and you take all the safety precautions necessary such as testing for STD's and other diseases."" ""The... I-"" Carlisle looked like he was about to pass out as he watched Edward stare at Jacob with dark eyes while his tongue came out to lick his lips and he swears he saw a trail of venom dripping down the side of his face before he quickly wiped it away, while Jacob continued to flush. ""I suppose the best way to go about it would be to limit the amount of blood shed to small proportions, create very shallow wounds and, clean and seal the wounds as quickly as possible after they've been made."" Jacob nodded quickly and raked a hand through his hair yet again. Carlisle wondered what on earth could be going through the boy's mind as Edward continued to stare and quite pointedly ignored Bella's questioning look when Seth raised his hand and Carlisle gave a sigh of relief. If there's one person who's question he doesn't have to worry about it's Seth's, the boy is quite possibly the most innocent being Carlisle has ever met in his entire life and he'd even heard Edward say what a beautiful mind Seth has. ""Yes, mr. Clearwater. What's your question?"" ""Is there a way to make deep-throating easier?"" Beautiful mind my ass! ""With, with practice most forms of sexual intercourse become easier to execute with time. So there aren't any quick fixes but it does get easier."" Carlisle swallowed as he looked over the crowd almost afraid to ask, ""Are there anymore questions?"" The students all stayed silent and Carlisle gave a quick nod, ""Alright then, I think that's everything. If there are anymore questions please refer to the pamflets mr. Banner will hand out as you leave the gym and for any further questions please feel free to see... myself or any of the other doctors down at the hospital."" The gym slowly emptied, with the quiluetes being ushered to their bus as some avoided any and all eye contact and others seemed to be beyond amused, Carlisle promised himself to never do this lecture ever again.

231,2,0,2-FrankieQuinn13-0.txt,lord-of-the-rings,FrankieQuinn13,"His eyes were fixed on the two figures in the centre of the garden down below. Watching as the knight and slave locked their lips in a passionate kiss. Sam's hands had weaved themselves in the man's long golden hair, when he suddenly moved to lay the younger man down on the bench they sat on, releasing the kiss as he removed Sam's shirt and lavished attention all over the slave's chest. Legolas pulled back to remove his shirt as well when Sam reached up to trace his fingers across the smooth expanse of the man's skin. Frodo pulled his legs up onto the chair against his chest and let out a heavy sigh. Really, he has no reason to be upset. Sam is a slave, a servant to the castle. It isn't uncommon for servants to... I suppose the proper term here would be to, pleasure honoured guests that visited. Frodo's never personally approved of such practices, but he is aware of them. Somehow it was different where Sam and this knight were concerned. Mind you, this isn't the first time that Frodo's noticed this strange, bond that's developed between Sam and the knight Legolas. He saw how Sam would stare at the knight whenever they arrived, his eyes would go wide and his skin would flush a light tinge when their eyes finally met. How a smile would tug at the corner of the knight's lips when Sam served them wine, their hands would touch for the briefest of moments before Sam quickly scurried out of the room. He'd overhear the ends of conversations in the dark corners of the castle walls in Gondor and watch as shadows moved along with the voices he'd hear. Merry and Pippin used to come see him with their concerns whenever they went to see Sam during the night and found his chambers empty, the way they'd stay until the early hours of the morning. He'd had his suspicions about them, but he never could have imagined... Sam's hands gripped Legolas' shoulders, his head was tossed back while his mouth hung open in the gasps and moans he could see the slave making. His body was covered by that of the knight and he couldn't see just what Legolas was doing but he could make a guess. Frodo has no right to be upset. He knew of the affections that his servant held for him and for years he never did a thing about it. It's just that Sam has always been there, always loyal and trusting by his masters side, there never seemed to be a reason to do anything. It was an arrogant thought, of course it was. But somehow Frodo honestly thought that Sam would always be there, that he would never stray or let another man catch his eye because his eyes were meant for Frodo and only Frodo. Apparently he was wrong, because someone else did catch Sam's eye and somehow Frodo knew things would never be the same again. Part of him blamed Aragorn. That shallow, spiteful and selfish cruel part of him that he refused to listen to wanted to blame the prince for bringing that man into his home. For bringing the thief that steal's a little peace of his most precious servant away from him every time their eyes meet. But Aragorn was obviously suffering under his own foolishness. He trusted his childhood friend's devotion to him and his family too much and now his pet has gone astray. It wasn't Aragorn's fault, regardless of how much the voice in Frodo's head moaned the loss of his precious because of the prince's foolishness. The rest of him knew that it was no one's fault but his own. He kept Sam's heart on a string for years, toying with it even when he wasn't aware of what he was doing. Sam has always been his and Frodo just assumed that it would always stay that way. He waited too long to claim the Sam and now he had been claimed by another. Sam's back arched off the stone bench as Legolas' head reached lower. Frodo could almost hear Sam call out Legolas' name, see him shudder in ecstasy when the blonde touched him just right. It made him think back to his...escapades with Aragorn over the passed few months. It was just a fling. Curiosity for these strange brave men that had saved his cousins from such horrible beasts. Curiosity turned into fascination which turned to lust which turned into the mess of an affair they currently found themselves in. But how was Frodo to know that Sam would find warmth and comfort in another when he wasn't by his side. How was he supposed to know that his servant would fall for another and that they'd fall for him as well? It was obvious in the kisses that they shared and the way they touched each other. It had nothing to do with simple needs being fulfilled. Or some sudden bout of boredom propelling Legolas to seek out pleasures in the trusting young man. They were falling for each other, Frodo could almost swear that they love each other already. But they could never have each other. Frodo gave a bitter sweet smile as he set his legs back down on the floor and cast one more look down at the two in the centre of the maze, trying to ignore how Legolas almost seemed to worship his precious servant while Sam's body drank in every touch like the knight was the source of life he needed to survive. Sam's heart was lost, stolen by the Elven knight, but that's all he could steal. Sam belongs to Frodo. It doesn't matter that Legolas has stolen his heart and captured his soul, because Sam's body belongs to Frodo and according to Shire slavery law... Not even fate could take him away. The End A/N: so how was it? Was it too mushy? Please review."

Bright hazel eyes went wide when Seth suddenly turned around onto his stomach and he brushed back the longs strands of hair that fell over his face, exposing a single diamond stud on the boy's ear. Jasper remembers Alice mention something about that earring causing quite the row when mrs. Clearwater found out about it, although at the moment Jasper couldn't help but think that it suited Seth, it actually made him look kind of- Jasper was suddenly ripped from his thoughts when Seth got up on his hands and knees and started crawling over the bed. ""Well, you're almost eighteen and I'm fourteen. So would you make a move on me if you liked me?"" ""Well, I-... No."" ""Why not?"" Seth asked as his eyes narrowed down on the blonde as he kept moving forward, ""You said it's O.K for Alice and Leah."" Jasper pushed his chair back until the back hit his desk while Seth just kept moving closer with a sensual smile on his face that somehow made the blonde's heart beat a little faster. ""Cause-"" ""Cause sex for minors under the age of sixteen is illegal?"" Seth smirked when Jasper's eyes went wide and he slipped off the end of the bed. ""If you tease me tonight If you sleaze me all right If you appease me tonight And let me ease you Cradle of love"" The song ended just as Seth walked over to stand right in front of Jasper's chair only for the song to start over a few seconds later. Damn auto reverse! ""Well rock the cradle of love"" ""Do you like me Jasper?"" Seth practically purred out as he put his hands on the arm rests of Jasper's chair and leaned forward, prompting the older teen to lie back as far as his chair would allow. ""Because I like you."" ""Seth, I really don't think you should-"" the blonde was cut off when Seth suddenly moved and sat right in his lap, making Jasper bite back a squeak and try to squirm back in his chair while the boy put both his hands on either side of the chairs back rest. Before Jasper could attempt another protest, Seth moved again and he pressed his lips against Jasper's in a deep kiss. Jasper froze as Seth let out a moan and pressed his body down against him and the blonde's hands clenched tight around his arm rests fighting back against the urge to kiss back and wrap his arms around the boy's body. The quiluete's hands slid down to wrap around Jasper's neck and pull him closer and an involuntary moan escaped Jasper's throat as the urge to touch the heated body pressed against him became unbearable when fate decided to give the blonde a break. But just this one time. ""Jasper? Jasper why is the music so loud?"" Seth pulled away at the sound of Esme's voice and went to sit on the bed while Jasper sat panting in his chair with his hands still clutched around the arm rests of his chair. ""Jasper-"" Esme appeared in the door and her eyes widened in surprise for a moment when she caught sight of Seth sitting on the bed. ""Seth, well hello dear. I didn't know you were going to be here."" ""Hi mrs. Cullen,"" Seth said with a warm smile, ""Soccer practice got cancelled so Leah brought me with her."" ""Oh, well."" Esme paused as her head gave a slight tilt and her lips pursed together in thought, ""Why aren't you wearing a shirt?"" ""I spilled some soda on it so Alice put it in the wash."" The boy said with an awkward laugh and Esme gave an understanding nod as her eyes ran over the room and she stepped inside. ""Where's- Jasper are you alright?"" The woman asked the moment she spotted her son, who sat panting in his chair as he stared out in front of him with wide eyes. The blonde gave a quick nod and swallowed as he spoke. ""Ye-yes mom I'm fine."" ""Are you sure, your skin is flushed."" Esme asked with concern as she reached out to put the back of her hand on Jasper's forehead and clicked her tongue in disapproval, ""You're face is warm."" ""I'm sure."" Jasper said as he quickly pushed himself up in his chair, moving so his mother wouldn't notice the bulge in his pants while Seth sat grinning a few feet away. ""Well, alright. If you start feeling off, just tell me we wouldn't want you getting sick."" Esme said as she turned towards Seth who's head quickly snapped up towards her as he ran a hand through his hair. ""Where did Alice and Leah run off to?"" ""Oh, they went to go get some food."" ""McDonald's most likely."" Esme let out a sigh, ""In the mean time why don't we go downstairs so I can make us both something to eat. I couldn't stomach a thing all through dinner."" ""It's O.K mrs. Cullen, I don't mind waiting-"" ""Absolutely not, if I can stop at least one child from eating an unhealthy meal then that will be my good dead for the day."" Esme grinned at the pout that fell over Seth's lips as she turned to leave the room. ""Come on, I'm starving."" ""O.K."" Seth said as he got up off the bed but not without giving Jasper a wicked grin. ""Later Jazz."" ""Oh and Jasper please turn that music down, I wasn't even aware that you knew who Billy Idol was let alone that you liked that song."" Esme called just as the door closed and Jasper fell back into his chair as he cursed Edward and made detailed plans on exactly how he'd destroy this damn tape. ""Sent from heaven above that's right To rob the cradle of love"" The End A/N: I really like pushy Seth for some reason. Please review"

Jacob moaned at the feeling of having Edward's cold arms wrapped around him and he wrapped his arms around the vampire's neck in return as he dragged his own nose up Edwards jaw to scent him and his lust spiked at the scent and cool hard skin that surrounded him. Maybe it was the imprint already starting to work, or maybe Jacob and Edward were both just losing their minds, either way the shifter couldn't help but answer. ""Only you baby."" Edward laughed as he turned his head to look into Jacob's eyes, ""Remind me to thank the pack later."" ""Remind me to thank Shorty and Barbie,"" Jacob gave a breathy chuckle before he suddenly blushed, ""So four hours huh."" ""That's how long my siblings last."" Edward said with a smirk as he finished, ""I can go for six."" Jacob shivered at the words whispered against his ear, ""Promise?"" ""Definitely but first, tell me,"" The telepath turned and to lay the shift down on the ground beneath him as he asked, ""Do you want me Jakey?"" ""Yes,"" Jacob groaned as Edward's hands started running all along his chest and he arched into the touch when a thought suddenly came to mind and he couldn't help but smirk as he whispered, ""I'm so hot, please make me better… Daddy ."" Edward almost froze before a hiss erupted from his chest and Jacob almost regretted what he said when the telepath suddenly moved right off the ground away from the treaty line and Jacob gasped when his back hit the side of a tree, with his arms above his head just before Edwards mouth covered his own in a deep kiss. And somewhere in the back of both Edward and Jacob's minds they knew they were forgetting something, but then Jacob moaned and Edward growled and they really couldn't remember their own names let alone whatever it is that they had forgotten. It probably wasn't important anyway. Xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Bella wandered around the Cullen house with a slight frown to her features. Edward was supposed to pick her up two hours ago but he never showed so Bella went over to the house instead thinking that there might be something wrong, but when she got there she found Emmett, Rosalie, Jasper and Alice all sitting in the living room while Carlisle worked in his study and Esme cooked. Alice greeted her by the door she said that Edward had an errand to run and wouldn't be back till a bit later so Bella decided to just wait for him at the house. But that was two hours ago and Bella was getting incredibly bored. The other's seemed preoccupied with their own things and really didn't seem to bothered by Edward's absence so Bella knew that he was probably fine wherever he was so she decided to just wander around the house instead when she suddenly caught sight of Edward's phone on the dining room table just as the device gave a low buzz as it vibrated against the smooth wooden surface. Bella bit her lip as she stared at the phone before finally just giving up and grabbing it to turn on the screen. He's her mate after all; they don't have any secrets so this is fine right? As soon as Bella turned it on she found a text message from an unknown number Bella frowned a bit as she opened it, frowning a bit more since it was empty when she closed the message and caught sight of a conversation between Edward and… Jacob? Bella blinked again, wondering what on earth they would be talking about and she opened the conversation only for her eyes to go wide and her skin to pale two shades at what she read. Word for word, Bella could hardly believe what she was reading until she finally got to the bottom and realized exactly what Edwards errand was since the time he met with Jacob coincided with the time that Edward was meant to go pick her up. The girl's features suddenly flushed and she screamed with rage at the betrayal, before throwing Edward's phone against the wall and storming out of the house. Just as the human got into her truck and it quickly drove away, Alice emerged from the den and gave a sigh as she stared down at the shattered remains of Edward's phone when Rosalie suddenly popped up behind her shoulder and spoke in a voice so sweet Alice might have thought her to be concerned if she didn't know any better. ""Oh my, what happened in here? Is Bella alright?"" Alice turned to give her sister a disapproving frown, ""You left it there for her to find and then texted Edward's phone didn't you?"" Rosalie gasped in mock indignation, ""Alice I would never-"" ""She had Emmett send the text."" Jasper said as he walked by the two and Rosalie rolled her eyes while Alice shook her head as she spoke, ""You are evil. What on earth are we going to tell Edward?"" ""Well, once he and Jacob emerge from wherever they disappeared to you can tell them that we did them a favor and that they're welcome."" The blonde said as she turned around and walked back into the den to plop down onto the seat beside her mate. Emmett laughed and Alice just gave a sigh as she looked back down towards the shattered remains of the device on the floor. ""I was talking about his phone."" The End A/N: this came out a lot longer than it should have I'm seriously so surprised at how long this is, especially since it's so severely crack-ish. Daddy-kink is a new type of fan fiction kink I'm into these days, although I'm not totally sure about my execution. Anyway, if you stayed right up until the end then please review."
234,4,11,4-FrankieQuinn13-11.txt,twilight,FrankieQuinn13,"and Paul just rolled his eyes as he leaned forward to press a kiss on his mates lips lingering a little to deepen it and the boy let out another sound of disgust. ""We'll see how gross it is once you finally hit puberty."" The boy frowned, ""What's puberty?"" ""Nothing."" Seth suddenly said as he walked into the hallway and grabbed a hold of the boy's shoulders, turning him around to steer him back towards the stairs. ""Go play in your room until dinners ready."" The boy turned and walked away without further comment and Seth glared as he folded his arms across his chest, ""What did I say about traumatizing my kid?"" He was older, but thanks to the shifter gene he didn't look too different from how he did eight years ago. Seth was taller a little bit leaner and his hair was longer but otherwise he still looked more or less the same. Despite the deep scars on his stomach and chest from the times that he gave birth. Demetri only seemed to laugh while Paul rolled his eyes, ""Jake and Edward here yet?"" Seth gave a sigh as he turned back and walked towards the kitchen where he was helping Esme get lunch ready, the motherly vampire only gave them a smile as she went buzzing around the kitchen and Seth shrugged as he sat down on one of the stools around the table, ""They had to take a later flight, Jake wasn't feeling well."" ""Is he alright?"" Seth gave a snort, ""Morning sickness. Edward wanted to cancel but Jake wouldn't hear of it, they should be here in a couple of hours."" ""What about Rose and Em'?"" Paul asked as he sat down and Demetri just sat down beside him as they watched the younger Quileute start chopping some onions. He didn't really care much for the comings and goings of the Cullen clan, so he barely paid attention. But Paul did. He liked to keep contact with his old pack brothers, it made him feel a little more human and Demetri could never deny his mate something he wanted. Especially since it took longer than anticipated for him to adjust to his change and they realized that he didn't really have much of a taste for animal blood. Then again, Paul was doing better than other members of the Olympic coven. ""They'll be here tomorrow; they're just getting some stuff sorted out with Bella."" Seth said with a sigh just before Esme spoke, ""She's hasn't been doing too well since she came back. Carmen said that their trying to wean her back onto animal blood but it doesn't seem to be going too well."" Bella did not take the annulment well. She tried, she tried very hard to understand and accept the twist of fate that suddenly changed the course of her life for what it was but it was incredibly difficult. Bella couldn't find it in herself to stay with them while Edward and Jacob were together. It hurt too much. So she left and tried to make it on her own, ran into a coven of nomads and started feeding on human blood. Things went downhill from there. ""They need to teach her how to control her bloodlust,"" Demetri said as he wrapped an arm around Paul's shoulders, ""Putting her back on animal blood won't help her now."" ""It's what Bella wants to do."" Seth explained with another sigh, ""Anyway, Alice and Embry just went out for a couple of hours, they should be back soon. She decided that Luka and Hannah don't have enough winter clothes so they went out to buy some."" Paul chuckled, ""She hasn't changed at all huh?"" ""Nope."" The back door opened just then and Seth smiled just as Jasper walked into the kitchen, the empath grinned as he walked over and gave the younger man a kiss, unconsciously projecting warmth and happiness when Seth leaned up to return it only for Paul to give a scoff. ""Who's being gross now?"" Seth glared from the corner of his eye as he flipped the hybrid off, Demetri laughed just as Esme let out a soft giggle as she grabbed some plates off the counter and handed them to Paul. ""Go on, make yourselves useful."" ""Aw but Esme-"" ""No buts, I'm going to go check on the kids."" The hybrid gave a huff as he got up only for Demetri to give a snort as he took the plates from his mate, ""I'll help you set them out."" ""I don't need any help setting out plates."" ""But you clearly want it."" ""Do you really have to argue with me about everything?"" ""Do you?"" Seth gave a snort as they left the room, before letting out a sigh when Jasper went to stand behind him and wrapped his arms around the shifter's waist, with his head on the younger man's shoulder. ""Does it hurt today?"" Jasper asked softly as his hands traced along the scars on the shifters torso under his shirt and Seth took a deep breath as he leaned back, soaking up the vampire's cold skin before he spoke, ""A little. Carlisle said that I should be O.K for a few more months and then-"" ""I don't want you in pain for that long."" Jasper breathed out and Seth paused, ""Does that mean you're finally going to do it?"" ""I don't want to. But I don't want to lose you either."" ""You know if you can't… Alice offered, she said she'd do it if we asked. She already has experience with Embry so-"" ""No."" Jasper said seriously as he let go of the younger man to grasp his chin and tilt his head up for another kiss, ""You're my mate, I'll turn you."" ""Are you sure?"" Jasper smiled, ""I almost lost you once. I'm not doing that again."" The end A/N: finally! It's done. The ending feels a little awkward but I'm happy with it Please review ."
235,4,19,4-FrankieQuinn13-19.txt,twilight,FrankieQuinn13,"up and he tried to look around the room but couldn't really see much despite the light of the full moon coming in through what he then realized was a basement window casting dark shadows all around. It was clean despite the broken remains of what looked like a piano in the corner of the room. Shades of black and white all around the wooden pieces as the keys lay scattered about. Another growl reached his ears and Embry's head snapped up towards the densest part of the shadows where he could just barely see the outline of a large dark silhouette. Embry instinctively squirmed back against the wall as the sounds of soft scraping reached his ears and the shadow moved closer, until a figure appeared in the pale moonlight that beamed into the room. Dark pitch black eyes stared back at him from a face with shallow cheeks. His skin was extremely pale and almost translucent but that somehow did nothing to affect his large muscular build. Embry recognized him as Emmett one of the vampires he saw a few times when they met at the treaty and again, when Edward bit Jacob only this time he looked different. Starved, the shifter realized as those pitch black eyes continued to stare, catching his every movement. ""Carlisle went first."" Embry swallowed hard when the vampire suddenly spoke, his voice was deep and rough like he hadn't used it in months, ""What?"" ""He knew that biting Jacob changed Edward so he tried to stop him,"" Emmett said lowly as he slowly inched closer moving on his hands and knees Embry realized as those dark eyes just stayed locked on him, ""But Leah was here, Jacob was working her he convinced her that the pain from Sam would go away if she turned. So she cut her arm and got Carlisle to bite her. Esme and Rosalie were home, when they caught her blood they tore her apart-"" Emmett's voice suddenly went high and shrill as he let out what sounded like a cough that somehow turned into a laugh as a wry smile spread over his lips and Embry tensed completely. ""Edward used his telepathy to force Seth to cut himself when he was out with Alice and Jasper."" ""How?"" Embry asked quietly and Emmett's head almost seemed to twitch at the sound of the shifters voice before he spoke, ""He's stronger now, Carlisle realized that shifter blood makes us stronger but there's a price to pay. When you bite a shifter, you lose your sanity."" Emmett kept moving closer, now less than an foot away from the shifter who just stared back at him with horrified eyes when his flight instincts finally kicked in again as he began to phase only for Emmett to move at the exact same; time grabbing the shifter by his arm and slamming him down to the ground while another hand went around his neck and tightened. The impact caused Embry to hit his head and his vision swam as he tried to get his bearings when the scent of leech suddenly overwhelmed him and he felt ice cold breaths against his ear. ""I can't fight it anymore, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry-"" Embry screamed when he suddenly felt the sharp sting of teeth breaking his skin before the searing burn of venom immediately began to rush through his veins moving from his neck to spread over his chest and up his spine, right into his head. The pain overwhelmed him causing him to gasp and stop breathing as his back arched off the floor and his world went black. xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Bright sunshine warmed the open field filled with flowers and grass, the sky was a bright blue without a cloud in sight. Birds chirped somewhere in the distance nowhere near the clearing but their beautiful melodic tones could be heard clearly enough even through the strangled cries of the body in his arms until it eventually went limp and he dropped it to the ground. She had beautiful pale skin, now even paler that it was drained of any blood that might flush her cheeks with heat. Golden blonde hair reflecting the beams of the sun and dark blue eyes now dulled over in the wake of her final breath. Her left arm was unfortunately bent around and turned the wrong way and there were scratches on her face dragging down away towards her ears. ""Hey!"" Embry startled as a body suddenly collided with his own and he found himself turned around and wrapped in a warm embrace as a pair of lips covered his own. It was warm and sweet and tasted of blood, Embry pulled back and gave a snort at the blood that stained Jacob's face and lifted up a hand to wipe it off while Jacob just watched him with a grin. ""What's taking you so long? We're all about to turn back."" ""She tried to fight back."" Jacob glanced over the other's shoulder and gave a snort at the body that lay behind him on the ground before pulling back to take his brother's hand and tugged him along, ""C'mon, let's go."" Embry laughed as he was tugged along, looking up to see the sun and the sky and the large green forest they were heading towards. Through the green grass and wild flowers of bright blue and purple and white before glancing back towards the body on the ground still and almost peaceful in the serene setting. Embry's laughter grew while Jacob just continued to pull him along and Embry let him despite the tears that ran down his cheeks, despite the ache that bloomed in his chest and throbbed in agony. Despite the voice inside of him that screamed. The End A/N: hmmm Too much? I'm usually pretty good with dark stories but I try to avoid them because I prefer happy endings, so I'm not really sure how I did with this one. Please review"
236,4,0,4-FrankieQuinn13-0.txt,twilight,FrankieQuinn13,"had disappeared to go get one of her sketch pads to show Embry some picture she drew, Emmett managed to corner Embry alone and apologise for what happened in the car, an apology which he accepted not knowing that his forgiveness would somehow lead to the older boy stalking him for the better half of the school year, trying to get him to go out with him. Things sort of get a little fuzzy from there. ""So does he talk about me?"" Embry looked up to stare at Jacob who sat next to him in history while mrs. Wilkes babbled on about something old in that monotone voice of hers. Half the class was asleep while the other half was passing notes. Embry leaned over towards Jacob as he asked, ""What?"" ""Does he talk about me?"" ""Does who talk about you?"" Jacob gave a frustrated sigh, ""Gigantor's brother who else."" Embry frowned, ""These nicknames were funny at first but now they're just annoying. He does have a name you know."" Jacob just rolled his eyes in annoyance, ""Just answer the question."" ""Who Jasper?"" ""No. The other one."" ""Oh. I don't think so, no."" Embry shrugged as he tried and failed to make out the diagram on the board. ""So, he never mentions me at all?"" ""I dunno, I guess I-...wait,"" Embry paused to turn in his chair and face Jacob, ""Why do you even care anyway? I thought he's just some creepy weirdo who won't stop staring at you."" ""He is."" Jacob insisted while Embry just frowned. ""Well if he is, then why would it matter whether or not he talks about you?"" ""It doesn't."" Embry smirked at the blush he could see spreading on Jacob's face, ""Then why did you ask?"" ""I-..."" Jacob stuttered and choked on his words for a moment before giving a low growl, ""Shut up!"" Xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Embry raked a hand through his hair as he walked out of Biology and made his way down the hallway, with a lingering blush on his face. Today they did the reproductive process which they do every single year and yet somehow it doesn't seem to get any easier. Contrary to popular belief, how they behaved around each other and said in general, Emmett and Embry haven't gone all the way yet. Sure they've done other things, lots of things. But they've never actually had sex before. A few months earlier they'd gotten pretty close one day when Embry went over but the native didn't feel he was ready for that step just yet and Emmett respected his decision. But things were different now. The Cullens were set to go on some big ski trip in Alaska that weekend and Emmett asked Embry if he wanted to go with him. Emmett had of course mentioned that they'd be sharing a room. Just the two of them. For one whole weekend. And Embry couldn't help but feel... Well Embry is feeling a lot of things right now. ""Is he dating anyone?"" Embry looked shook his head from those stray thoughts when he found Jacob waiting for him just outside of class with a suspicious red tinge on his face. ""What?"" ""Is he dating anyone?"" ""Is who dating anyone?"" ""Godzi-"" Jacob stopped himself short and gave a sigh when Embry's eyes narrowed down at him. ""Emmett's brother, is he dating anyone?"" ""Who Jasper?"" ""No the other one!"" ""Edward?"" Embry blinked as he tried to think back, ""Not as far as I know."" ""Oh, O.K."" Jacob said with a nod while Embry just stared at him with a slight tilt of his head, ""You like him don't you?"" Jacob's head snapped up and his blush spread all the way to the tips of his ears as he turned away and started stomping down the hall, ""No."" ""You know I could talk to him about you if you want."" Embry teased and Jacob glared at him. ""Shut up."" The two walked in silence as they headed up to the cafeteria. Jacob kept his head ducked down as he tried to will away his blush while Embry just smiled at his friend. They breached the cafeteria doors and went through the lunch line before separating with Embry shooting a smile over to his friends and plopping down on one of the open seats at the Cullen table, giving a sigh at the arm that automatically draped over his shoulder and lips that kissed his cheek. The native turned back to face Emmett and took a deep breath causing the blue eyes that were staring at him to fill with confusion. Until he leaned up to speak against the other's ear, ""I'll go with you."" ""What?"" ""The trip this weekend, I want to go with you."" Embry pulled back while Emmett watched him closely before he spoke. ""Ya sure?"" ""Yeah."" Emmett gave a bright dimpled smile an leaned in to give his boyfriend a deep kiss, before Embry pulled back and gave him a smile. ""Jake's been asking me about your brother all day."" Emmett frowned, ""Who Jasper? Didn't know he was Jacob's type."" ""No not him,"" Embry said as he rolled his eyes before nodding towards another seat at the table, ""The other one."" Rosalie was busy on her phone while Jasper sat with a book. Alice gave him an enthusiastic ""hello"" when Edward suddenly leaned forward while his eyes kept shooting glances to some other part of the cafeteria. ""Oh,"" Emmett nodded his head as his eyes filled with realisation, ""Him too huh."" Embry paused to frown at Emmett, ""What do you mean him too?"" ""Hey Embry, you're friends with Jacob Black right?"" Embry's head snapped back towards Edward and his eyebrows knit together in thought, ""Yeah, best friends. Why?"" ""Well,"" the bronze haired boy leaned in a bit and as he spoke, ""Does he ask about me?"" Embry gave a sigh. Here we go again. End A/N: yeah lame little drabble thing I did real quick. Hope you liked it Please review."
237,4,5,4-FrankieQuinn13-5.txt,twilight,FrankieQuinn13,"about using her like that, but he didn't see any other way. But Jacob won't speak to him and whenever they're both around Bella they always just end up fighting. So far Jacob had managed to convince the pack that his hatred of Edward stemmed from the heart games that he was playing with Bella but of course the Cullen's knew the truth. He didn't seem to blame any of them for what Edward did, but he couldn't exactly trust them either. After all Edward may have lied to him but they helped the vampire keep his secret. Alice would call him sometimes, text whenever Jacob was around the pack and couldn't really talk. They never talked about Edward though, Alice didn't want to upset Jacob by getting even more involved in that mess than she already was. Jasper's spoken to the shifter a few times, mostly on patrol's since Jacob refused to go anywhere with Edward under any circumstances whatsoever. They'd have civil conversations and Jasper didn't try to meddle in their affairs. Surprisingly enough, Rosalie is the one that spent the most time with Jacob. Edward has seen glimpses in the blonde's mind of her and the shifter's meetings where Jacob would rage his anger on what happened and Rosalie would edge him on. She helped him blow off some steam if you will. As far as Emmett was concerned Jacob didn't really have anything against him. The shifter actually seemed pretty embarrassed at the fact that he's been calling another man by his name. Between them it was more awkward than anything else. Bella was left none the wiser, somehow also believing that Jacob's hatred of Edward was her fault. She seemed remorseful about that fact, but then again sometimes Edward felt like she was almost trying to lead Jacob on. That didn't sit well with Edward at all. ""Edward?"" Edward looked down at the human girl beside him, staring into her deep brown eyes and almost sighing in frustration since they weren't the brown eyes he wanted to see. ""Is something wrong?"" 'Edward, if you want Jacob to forgive you, you know what you have to do first' Alice looked away, down at the ground as she folded her arms over her chest and Edward swallowed hard. Yes, he knows what he has to do first. Bella was staring at him in concern with her lips twisted in a slight frown while her eyes seemed to fill with confusion. Edward took a deep breath, he didn't have to fight back against the urge to bite Bella, at least not too much anyway. The urge was there, but she didn't entice him as much as she used to. The vampire forced a smile as he leaned down to kiss her forehead, earning a growl from the other side of the treaty. ""No, everything is fine."" Rosalie huffed a sigh of frustration while Emmett just gave his brother a worried glance. 'You can't keep this up forever bro' Of course not, but now isn't the time to break Bella's heart all over again. There's too much at stake right now. Later after the fight with Victoria, that's when he'll do it. 'Whatever you do, you'd better do it fast' Rosalie thought smugly and Edward could almost feel her smirk as he followed her gaze across the border towards the wolves. Embry's wolf seemed to hobble over to Jacob's and Quil followed as the beta let out soft growls of anger, he got hurt during his spar with Emmett earlier but it wasn't too bad. Carlisle said that he'll have to stay in his wolf form for a while but also that he'd be healed in a few hours. 'Knock it off, that's annoying' Quil growled as he nudged Jacob's side, 'So she picked a bloodsucker. There's plenty of fish in the sea' 'That's not what this is about.' 'Then what is this about?' Jacob shook his head and let out a snarl, 'Nothing' Embry moved closer to Jacob and started nuzzeling the side of the other wolf's head, growling softly. 'Stop moping, you're making everyone depressed' Jacob gave a snort but still leaned into Embry and nuzzled the side of his head as well. Just then a flash of a memory passed among the wolves, it was so quick Edward wasn't really sure who's mind it came from. There was Jacob and a fire, someone was next to him and then a kiss. Edward only had a moment for shock before Seth came seemingly out of nowhere and jumped between the three tackling Jacob to the ground before jumping back with his tail wagging high as he gave an excited yip. 'I'm not depressed' If wolves could roll their eyes, Quil would've, 'I doubt you even know what that word means' Jacob seemed amused for the most part and was about to return the favour when Quil suddenly jumped on top of him before Seth joined in as well. 'Enough!' Sam said giving a sharp bark to make the shifters pull apart, 'There'll be time to fool around later, pay attention' The shifters all got up and Jasper gave them an indulgent smile as he continued from where he'd stopped when the wolves suddenly went tumbling across the dirt. Edward's eyebrows furrowed for a moment in confusion when Rosalie suddenly got his attention again, 'I'd cut the blood bag loose if I were you, it looks to me like the pup's already moving on' Edward tensed as his sister glanced up at him with a smirk. No one ever listens to her. Edward looked back at the shifters as he thought back to that slither of thought he caught earlier while Jacob seemed to be ignoring his existence completely. But usually, she's right. The End A/N: shitty ending But I told you guys it was a bum story, it needs way more work but whatever I just want to get your opinion on it. What'cha think? Please review"

There must be a desire to claim and be claimed . But for some reason you think just cause you fucked me that you're the one that made the claim."" Edward growled at the smug look in the younger man's eyes while Jacob's smirk just grew, ""You've got it backwards, Cullen."" ""Excuse me."" ""You said you can't stop thinking about me and I'm guessing my scent is the only one you can still track. I bet it's gotten so bad that you think about me whenever you fuck Bella or even just kiss her. And now you're camping out outside my apartment, even though you have no idea why."" Edward's eyes went wide and he tried to take a step back only for Jacob to move along with him with a smile, ""You're right though, I do want you. But for me you're more like a pet, I own you and you do whatever I tell you to."" Edward frowned, ""What?"" ""Doc didn't tell you about that part did he?"" Jacob gave a wide grin as he pulled away and folded his arms across his chest, ""I was going to let you off easy, but you're pissing me off so-"" ""Jacob what are you talking about?"" ""I'm talking about this,"" The raven let out a dramatic sigh before he spoke. ""Edward, turn around and leave this building right now."" Before Edward could even begin to understand what was happening he turned around and left. Out the kitchen, back through the short hallway and right out the door. By the time he regained any kind of brain function he was already outside, standing on the sidewalk just a few feet away from his car. Leah stood in front of him, snapping her fingers in front of his face, ""Hey! Edward, what's wrong?"" Edward blinked and suddenly let out a deep breath that he didn't even realise he'd been holding in. Raking a hand through his hair, Edward's eyes darted around his surroundings and he swallowed hard when Leah spoke again. ""Damn it Cullen, what happened?"" ""I don't know."" Xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Twelve thirty that night Jacob was on the couch with Embry, staring blankly at the tv in front of them with his head on the omega's shoulder while guilt made his stomach toss and turn every two to five minutes. ""You called him your pet?"" Embry asked even as he kept his eyes on the tv as well and Jacob gave a nod, ""And then you commanded him to leave."" Another nod. ""Was that really necessary Jake?"" ""He was asking for it."" Jacob answered with a growl, ""He said he owned me and that I can't stay away from him."" ""You can't stay away from him."" Embry dead panned and Jacob grumbled in annoyance while the omega continued, ""The only reason you're still up right now is cause of him."" ""I don't need him."" ""But you want him."" ""The hormones'll pass."" Jacob answered with a huff, ""Once Jay changes I won't feel anything anymore."" ""Are you trying to convince me or yourself?"" Embry asked and Jacob tensed, the omega shrank back a little at the spark of anger he felt as Jacob spoke, ""I'm not trying to convince anyone. Besides you're one to talk, walking around here and sulking for months like a whipped puppy because of Jared."" Embry winched and Jacob had to take a deep breath to reign his anger back in, ""Embry, I didn't mean-"" ""I'm over Jared, I don't want to go back to him."" Embry said quietly as he gave a soft sigh, ""But my world used to revolve around him so right now I'm just... Before I do anything else, I want my world to revolve around me for once. My point is, the difference between you and me is that Jared didn't get me pregnant. I wanna make sure you get that it won't be easy."" ""I know and... I'm sorry."" ""It's O.K."" The omega smiled as he leaned down to press a kiss on the top of Jacob's head, ""Hormones right?"" ""You have no idea. First I'm happy, then I'm pissed and then sad."" Jacob sighed, ""I was horny enough before but now I can't even wear jeans without being uncomfortable."" ""It'll pass once Jay's older."" ""Sure it will."" Jacob said with a snort as he buried his head a little deeper into Embry's neck to take a deep breath of his scent when he pulled back a bit and frowned. His mind has been so preoccupied that he only just noticed- ""You cut your hair."" Embry looked down and blushed, ""Yeah... Jared liked it long and I just-"" ""I get it. It looks good."" Jacob smiled and Embry's blush went a shade darker as he mumbled out a ""thanks"". Jacob's smile grew a little more as he sat up and leaned over the omega to cup the side of his face and press a soft kiss on his lips. ""Why didn't I mate you?"" Embry sighed despite the deep blush burning across his cheeks, ""When I came back you were pregnant and in love with the father of your child."" Jacob groaned in frustration as he fell back on the couch as Embry finished, ""You still are."" ""I don't love him."" ""Then what do you feel?"" Jacob just stared up at the ceiling, ""I don't know."" Embry frowned at the alpha and opened his mouth to speak when a cry reached their ears and Jacob groaned again. Embry chuckled as he got up off the couch. ""I'll get him."" ""Thanks."" Jacob mumbled out as the other left the room still staring at the ceiling. He kept his eyes open cause he's exhausted, if his eyes shut he'll fall asleep for sure and if he falls asleep, he'll start dreaming again. Honestly Jacob's had enough of Edward Cullen for one day. The End A/N: yeah Please review"

The telepath moved closer and tried to get a read on Jacob's thoughts but they were guarded and Edward couldn't get much other than the fact that Jacob thought it was nice to see Bella again. ""Hey Bells, long time no see."" Jacob said as he pulled back and Bella frowned, ""Yeah and whose fault was that?"" ""We've talked on the phone."" ""Yeah but you always seem so distracted and we haven't hung out in such a long time."" Bella sighed, ""I wanted to talk about what happened, the last time with-"" ""It's fine, don't worry about it."" Jacob said easily when his eyes darted up towards the telepath and an indefinable look came onto his face, ""You don't need to apologize."" ""Really?"" ""Yeah really,"" Jacob said looking the telepath right in the eye when he spoke, despite the fact that he was talking to Bella, ""You made your choice and I've made peace with it. I've moved on."" Edward felt something in his chest tug at that while Bella gave a strained smile as she looked up at Jacob, ""You have?"" ""Yeah,"" Jacob said as he returned his gaze to the girl, ""I imprinted."" Edward froze. ""T-That's great, Jake. I'm so happy for you."" Bella said moving in for one more hug. ""Wait is that why you're here, is it someone from Forks? Who is she?"" the girl was tense, both Jacob and Edward could tell that she was worried that Jacob may have possibly imprinted on her. Jacob gave a snort as he let her go, ""Don't worry, it's not you."" ""I wasn't-…"" The girl started to flush, ""It just would have complicated things if it were. So you didn't come here to see me?"" ""No,"" Jacob said looking Edward dead in the eye all over again and a feeling of dread washed over him until the shifter finished, ""I didn't come here to see either of you."" And suddenly Edward was confused, but Bella apparently felt the same way as the girl just frowned, ""Then who-"" ""Jake? What are you doing here?"" a voice suddenly called prompting all three to turn and find Eric Yorkie heading towards them. All at once Edwards mind was bombarded with thoughts from Jacob about nothing and no one except for Eric and the telepath's eyes went wide. A beaming smile broke out over Jacob's face and he ran up to meet the older teen, Bella's eyes went wide and Edward just stared when Jacob wrapped his arms around the shorter teen and gave him a deep kiss. Eric let out a yelp of surprise before he leaned into it with a moan before he suddenly remembered himself and pulled away when Mike let out a loud wolf whistle near the school's entrance and a few of the other students laughed. Eric pulled away and Jacob seemed to let out a growl of annoyance causing the teen to blush as he slowly eased himself out of Jacob's grasp. ""I'm never going to hear the end of this."" The teen sighed, ""What are you doing here?"" Jacob shrugged, ""There's a bon fire on the rez tonight, some of the council members from the tribe want to meet you so I figured I could come pick you up early and we could spend some time together just the two of us."" ""You could've given me a little warning."" ""I wanted to surprise you."" Eric sighed, ""Fine, it's probably a good thing that I didn't drive to school today, huh?"" ""Ready to go?"" Jacob asked and Eric nodded as the shifter led him back to the bike where Bella and Edward still stood. ""Uh, Jake?"" The girl asked and Jacob felt himself start to flush before Edward spoke, ""He's your imprint."" ""They know?"" Eric blushed and Jacob just met Edward's gaze as he spoke, ""The council says that sometimes when some bonds are corrupted by unnatural elements new ones can be formed. Yeah he's my imprint but, Eric makes me happy, that's all that really matters."" ' You should be happy too; I won't be in your way anymore' ""Oh, well that's great Jake, I'm happy for both of you."" Bella said and Eric gave a slightly embarrassed smile. ""Thanks Bella."" ""We should go."" Jacob said as he tugged at Eric's side and the human rolled his eyes, ""You're so impatient."" ""You weren't complaining about it on Monday when I-"" Eric quickly reached up to cover Jacob's mouth, Bella giggled and Eric just sighed, ""Let's go, right now."" The shifter smirked as he handed Eric one of the helmets hanging off of the handlebars and put the jacket around the human's shoulders before pulling his own helmet over his head and they both climbed on before the bike roared to life. Edward and Bella just stood there as they watched them drive off until Bella let out a sigh, ""Wow, who would've thought. But I guess its better this way. At least he can move on right? Edward?"" The telepath didn't answer. His mind was stuck, as he tried to process what just happened. Caught on the words that Jacob gave him before he left. ' You should be happy too; I won't be in your way anymore.' Simple, to the point and yet somehow… Edward couldn't understand a thing. The end A/N: Yeah I'm a little sick of imprint fics where Jacob just always ends up with Edward (despite the fact that I'm always writing them *shrinks down in shame*) but this time I decided to do something a little different. I'm assuming that imprint fics like this have been done before. I haven't really read any Twilight fics lately so if anyone knows any stories where Jacob imprints on Edward but doesn't end up with him then let me know. Please review"
240,2,26,2-CEShaughnessy-26.txt,lord-of-the-rings,CEShaughnessy,"regarded Pippin directly now, a huge scowl on his face. ""So, young hobbit. Ye wanted to know just what happens to wicked dwarfling brats who disobey their parents and wreak all sort of havoc?"" Pippin actually shrank back, not quite sure where Gimli was about to direct all that anger. The dwarf surprised him by chuckling warmly and softening his expression. ""This is where my father's great big belt does come into the picture young Pippin. After all was said and done and we knew my friend was going to live, he went for his strap and bade me follow him out back to the little shed where he stored his tools. I can tell ye I was quaking in my boots by then and I just wanted to get it over with. All I could think about was the bad thing I'd done, starting with willfully disobeying my parents, and I knew I was in for a world of hurt."" He grimaced at the memory. ""My father started in with the longest angry scolding he'd ever bestowed upon me, and of course that just drew out my suffering even longer!"" He chuckled. ""Which was probably his intention, now that I think about it. On the one hand I wanted to get my punishment over with, but on the other…"" The dwarf paused, remembering. ""And all the while he was reprimanding me that strap was dangling from his hand. I couldn't take my eyes off it! Well, I knew what was going to happen when he finished talking. At long last, he did. And then he hauled my sorry bare bottom over his knee."" Gimli shook his head at the memory. ""And that was the flat out worst whipping he ever gave me in the whole of my young life!"" He reached over and took Pippin's chin in his hand and gazed steadily into the youth's bright green eyes, his expression serious. ""And I never would have dreamed of telling him I wasn't deserving of that punishment. I was responsible for my friend almost dying, even though I had meant no harm. It goes to show you how a seemingly innocent act, one not well thought out, can bring harm to both yourself and another."" He released him and sat back against a tree. ""Well? What do you think of that?"" Pippin had gone a bit pale and hung his head for a moment. Finally he looked up. ""I'm sorry we got you hurt Gimli. And I'm sorry I said I didna deserve the tanning you gave me."" ""I'm sorry too Gimli."" Merry put his arm around his cousin's shoulders and squeezed him. ""We weren't thinking."" ""No, you most certainly were not. I trust you did understand the moral of the story then?"" Gandalf watched them closely. ""Oh, aye! Most definitely so."" Pippin's head bobbed up and down. The wizard raised an eyebrow in expectation. ""Well?"" The cousins looked at each other and then back at the group. ""We need to stop and think more clearly before we do anything that might be dangerous,"" Merry began. ""Especially if it might mean someone could get hurt."" ""And we need to understand that if we get caught--"" ""Ahem!"" Gimli scowled, cutting Pippin off. He eyed the dwarf warily. ""I mean, if we do indeed participate in, umm…a harmless prank or two, uh…we have to be willing to accept the consequences of our behavior."" ""Better. What else?"" Gimli prompted. ""Umm, we shouldna do dangerous things in the first place."" Pippin looked at Merry for help. Merry continued, ""Well, when we see something we can't do by ourselves we should ask for help. Then maybe we wouldn't get in trouble."" ""And?"" ""Don't ever borrow a wizard's staff,"" Pippin said solemnly. ""And don't ever antagonize a dwarf,"" added Merry. ""Or a wizard,"" giggled Pippin. ""Or for that matter a Ranger or a big Gondorian captain."" He stole a mischievous glance at Aragorn and Boromir and was rewarded with their laughter. Pippin grinned at Legolas. ""Or an elf either, I suppose."" Legolas chuckled. ""Or try to reach apples you can't get to."" Merry joined in his cousin's enthusiasm. ""Especially if they happen to be near a wasp's nest."" Gimli sighed. ""Are ye not forgetting the most important lesson of all?"" They thought hard for a few minutes and looked at one another, bewildered. The dwarf shook his head slowly. ""Lads. Think about it."" Gimli tapped them each atop their head. ""Many people care about ye, yer family and yer friends. Think about their feelings once in awhile! Tis not a kind thing to frighten them half outta their wits! So don't be wasting your time with dangerous activities without stopping to think it over first. What I'm trying to say ye wee foolish brats is we wouldn't want to lose ye!"" He looked around at the group who had grown as close as a family over the time and peril they had shared thus far. ""We have far too much of our own time and energy invested in keeping ye alive and well already."" The halflings appeared humbled as they nodded their understanding. All was quiet and thoughtful around the campfire for quite a few minutes. At last, Pippin stretched mightily and clambered to his feet. ""Well now! I think it's time we got some of those apples, eh?"" He started to saunter off in the direction of the tree. Looking back over his shoulder he added, ""Those wasps have got to be gone by now, don't you think? What with their nest laying on the ground and all."" The others stared at one another in amazement and then over at the dwarf. Gimli's face was glowing a maddening shade of red and he shot abruptly to his feet uttering a loud ""ARRRGGGHHHH!"" as he sprinted after the hobbit. The group winced as one at the high pitched cry as Gimli tackled him bodily. Merry grinned at them. ""Pippin never has had a particularly good memory!"""

Yes, that Sancho is quite the terror, isn't he? Oh, yes! He gets my lad into dreadful fixes sometimes. I know. And my dear, I heard he called you fa- Don't say it! Tulip interrupted with a moan. ""T'was very unkind of him. Pansy flapped her wing sympathetically in Tulip's direction. Tulip sniffed a tear away. Yes. It still bothers me. Of course it does, dear. Now, back to the matter we were discussing. The egg won't hatch because there is no chick inside. Tulip looked alarmed. What? How do you know? My dear, I am an expert in the subject of eggs and hatching, and many other things as well, I might add. But no matter. Our concern is Pippin and how he will take this when he finds out. Tulip began to worry. A tear wiggled its way from her embroidered eye and landed on the straw in her nest. But I thought you didn't like Pippin? Here now, none of that, that, that - bawling. I shan't have it in my barn. Pansy scratched the straw over her brood to keep it warm and waddled away from her nest to join Tulip. I'm sorry. But I can't bear to see Pippin so disappointed when my egg doesn't hatch. Well. . .perhaps we might come up with a plan, of sorts. By the way, I never said I didn't like the lad. I said he was an indulged, mischievous, naughty, manipulative, scheming, wicked little. . . That's enough, Pansy! Or I'll, I'll. . .I'll thump you on your bill with my hoof! The big goose laughed. Oh my, you are such a little rogue! I like that! Now, about the plan— What kind of a plan? Tulip eyed the goose in suspicion. Now, don't you worry your little pink head, dearie. Pansy patted the piglet on her snout with her wing. Once more, I am an authority in figuring out how to, shall I say, find the path of least resistance. A goose and knitted piglet huddled together whispering in the dusk. A warm breeze filtered its way through the barn's open door while merry laughter drifted from the corner as the new friends and conspirators planned. *** Twenty-one days is a long time if you're waiting for something wonderful to happen, especially if you are a small hobbit lad and a skeptical, older cousin. Pippin and Merry were still abed in the early morning hours when Paladin cracked open the door to his son's room and crept in. He was about to switch the egg beneath Tulip for the fertile one he carried when he pulled his hand back and let out a cry of surprise as something brushed against his hand and cheeped. Pippin awoke immediately and catapulted himself from the bed. Merry sat up and rubbed his eyes. ""What's going on?"" Paladin was already kneeling next to Tulip's basket. With a wide grin he lifted the tiny duckling to eye level. ""My chicken! Da, Tulip hatched a chick!"" Pippin danced around the room. Paladin rocked back on his heels and chuckled. ""Well, my lad, I don't think you can call this a chicken, but 'tis a mighty fine looking wee duckling!"" ""What? How?"" Merry was sliding from the bed to join them. ""I don't know how, lad, but here it is,"" Paladin said, still cradling the duckling. Pippin held out his hands to take the fluffy creature, grinning from ear to ear. ""I don't care if it's a chicken or a duck. Tulip is a mum!"" ""Yes, how about that?"" Paladin ruffled his son's curls before getting to his feet. He eyed the basket thoughtfully as he carefully pocketed the egg in his hand. At that moment Eglantine leaned into the room. Smiling, she said, ""Lads! Pansy's eggs are hatching! Come see!"" Pippin scooped up Tulip and tucked her into the pocket of his nightshirt before clambering after his father and Merry. In the barn, Pansy was found proudly showing off her new family while giving a warning honk that no one except Eglantine could come near. After a suitable amount of time admiring the new babies they began filing out of the barn to the farmhouse, ready to prepare for the day ahead. *Great-Aunt Pringle Took lingered. ""Coming, Auntie?"" Eglantine called. ""In a moment, Tina."" She waved them away with a flick of her wrist, and then turned back to Pansy. When they were alone at last Pringle broke into a huge smile. ""Good work, my lass! I think you and Tulip make a fine team. Thank you for helping care for my dear Pippin."" I give Auntie Pringle a soft honk meaning 'you are quite welcome!' ""Yes, I know. It was all in a day's work for you, wasn't it now? You are such a resourceful goose."" I humbly protest that it was she who should have the credit, but she will not hear of it. ""But it was your plan, and a splendid one at that. I had no idea that Pad was going to go find that chicken egg, but I think one of my new ducklings will make a much better pet for our Pip. Don't you?"" I honk my approval and close my eyes. It has been a very long day. I smile to myself as only a goose can as my dear Auntie Pringle continues, ""You are quite welcome, my dear. It was my pleasure. Thank you for asking me to join in with yours and Tulip's little scheme."" I open one eye and watch as Auntie makes her way to the door. Yes indeed, a long day. And now I must get some sleep because I've a feeling my children will be arriving quite early in the morning and a mother's work is never done. *My story ""Great Auntie Pringle Took"" is the first tale this OC appeared in."

""Son, when you have children of your own some day you will finally understand exactly what I'm trying to say. 'Tis a father's duty to protect his family, and when I wasn't able to…well, it isn't an easy thing to accept. I have never in my life felt so helpless as during the time you were gone. And as for the Sight, blessing or curse I'm really not certain which anymore, but it was so hard knowing what I did and not being able to change things. Do you understand, lad?"" Pippin nodded slowly. ""I think so."" ""And I was quite upset that Merry had left his father a letter and you hadn't."" ""Merry didn't think I should. He thought the one he left was enough."" Paladin nodded. ""And knowing your cousin as I do he was most likely thinking it was better that his hot-headed uncle didn't find out much until you were both well on your way."" Pippin sucked in a quick breath. ""How did you----"" ""Peregrin, please give your father a little credit for knowing how to reason things out, eh?"" Paladin laughed. ""Ah, it's amazing what I can figure out when I'm able to put my anger aside. It all makes perfect sense now. Your mother was right, as she usually is."" ""But Da? You never answered my question."" ""No?"" ""I asked if you were still angry with me for going."" ""So you did."" Paladin thought this over. ""Well, let's just say that I'm working on letting go of my anger, all right?"" He patted his son's shoulder. ""Yes, I admit I'm still a bit upset with you, especially the more I find out about what you went through. And from what I saw today I know you have a good deal of healing yet ahead of you. I mourn for the innocence you've lost forever, Pippin. But I am very proud of you too. You're not the same irresponsible lad of one short year ago and I'm stunned by the changes in you."" Pippin smiled at his father's words. ""We have a great deal of talking yet to do, Da."" ""Aye that we do. Just remember let's keep on talking, all right? And no more running off without letting someone know what you're about. We don't deserve to be frightened like that anymore."" ""I will."" ""And I'll try not to do the kind of things that make you want to run off. All right?"" ""Yes, all right. And Da? I think I'm ready to go home now."" ""That's good to hear."" Paladin eased his son from his lap and stood. ""Oh my, I'm getting too old for this sitting on the ground business."" He stretched his stiff back. ""Shall we?"" Pippin nodded and linked his arm through his father's. ""Pippin?"" Paladin asked as they climbed the little hill leading back to the farmyard. Pippin looked at him questioningly. ""I've been meaning to ask. However did you manage the little growth spurt?"" Pippin laughed merrily. ""Oh, that. Have you ever heard of Ents, Da?"" Paladin scratched his head. ""Can't say that I have."" ""Well, after we made it out of Fangorn Forest Merry and I…"" ""Fangorn Forest?"" ""Aye, a rather frightening place all on its own, but there was a tree shepherd there-"" ""Ah, now that's a legend I have heard tales of."" Paladin looked at him curiously. ""But, not a legend after all I take it?"" Pippin shook his head and grinned broadly. ""No indeed, as Merry and I were soon to find out."" ""So, is your cousin taller too, then?"" ""Yes, and he still managed to stay taller than me! Anyway, this is what happened…"" ""Are you ready to rest now, son?"" Pippin leaned over and kissed his mother's cheek before nodding. ""I'm sure a few hours to lie down could only be a good thing."" He followed her down the long corridor to his room. Pippin felt the burning sting of tears behind his lashes and tried to blink them away. He swallowed hard. ""Mum, I'm sorry I ran away. It…it was a very childish thing to do."" ""We all do things we regret sometimes dear, and I dare say you'll learn from your experiences."" Eglantine hugged him. ""I'm glad you and your father are talking."" ""We…we talked about a great many things. It's odd, but I feel like I got to know Da a good deal better today than I ever have. He spoke to me like I was an adult. I can't tell you how much I appreciated that."" Eglantine settled on the side of the bed and tucked the covers around her son. She smiled and smoothed her hand across his hair before planting a kiss on his forehead. ""I think your father has begun to realize just how much you've grown up Pippin."" She studied his face for a moment before speaking again. ""And I think you've realized just how vulnerable to hurt your father can be. The two of you are more alike then you care to admit but it's something I've always known. You're both very stubborn and you each have a great deal of love in your hearts for your family."" Pippin nodded sleepily and yawned. Eglantine smiled. ""Perhaps you'll be able to sleep a bit better now. Remember we're nearby if you need us."" ""You've both always been nearby Mum."" Pippin touched his chest. ""Right here in my heart. As far as I'm concerned you were there with me all the way through my journey. Keeping me going."" Eglantine smiled and kissed his cheek. ""Good night my little love. I hope you sleep well."" ""Night, Mum. And I'm really glad the king did come back after all."" ""And I'm glad my son came back. All the way home at long last."" She closed the door softly as Pippin closed his eyes."

Pervinca's voice was small as she tugged on her mother's apron. ""Is that true? Are we going to have another Fell Winter?"" ""Oh, don't worry, child. We may well receive a big storm but I very much doubt we're going to have another winter like that one."" She frowned at Pimpernel, who simply shrugged as if to say her mother knew it was the truth. The weather conditions over the last few weeks had proven to be very erratic and even Da had made several comments about having a harsh winter. ""Come, children. Let's get supper started before everyone comes in. I have a great deal to accomplish before bedtime and I'll need all the help I can get."" In the barn, Paladin worked with two of the hired hobbits, Tomias Hornblower and Togo Burrows, rushing about to get everything secured for what might prove to be a long and restless night. As if that wasn't enough, Orangeblossom was due to freshen any day now and Paladin hoped it would be before they left for the journey to Brandy Hall. While he knew the farmhands were quite capable of handling things he preferred to be present in case there were any problems. ""Hurry up lads, that wind is picking up more every minute and I want everyone to get inside where it's warm the minute the chores are finished."" Paladin made another circuit around the barn, checking to see that all the stock had been fed and plenty of fresh hay had been put down. Tomias nodded and trotted off to finish his work. All around them, hobbits scurried about, anxious to be done with their tasks and inside sipping a hot cup of tea and enjoying a pipe filled with good Longbottom leaf. _______________________________________________________________________________ Pippin shrieked in delight at Merry's idea, and clapped his hands. ""I want to do it, Merry!"" He was practically dancing a jig around his older cousin in his delight with the scheme. ""We have to talk your parents into it first, you know."" ""But it's ForeYule and that ought to be all right. And then Frodo can come to the Hall with us for AfterYule!"" Pippin tilted his head in thought. ""Or perhaps we can persuade everyone to come to Bag End instead!"" ""Now, what a surprise that would be."" Merry sighed. ""But it might not work. The best solution would be for everyone to simply come with us to Bag End to celebrate."" ""YES! Cousin Frodo would be thrilled!"" ""Shh! They'll hear,"" Merry cautioned. ""What are you giggling about, Pippin?"" Pervinca studied her little brother suspiciously as she rounded the corner and entered the parlour. Merry said nothing and turned away to place another log on the fire. ""You lads had best fetch in some more wood from the shed,"" Pimpernel told them as she hurried past, her arms full of blankets. ""The night will be very cold and we'll need to keep the fires burning. Come now, everyone must shake a leg and help out!"" ""Pervinca, come back and help us get everything that we've brought from the cellar into the kitchen,"" Eglantine called. ""I want to get the doors closed up tight the moment your father gets in."" More scurrying about, accompanied by giggles and some pushing and pulling amongst the younger ones. Eglantine took a moment away from her work to enjoy the sight of her children gathered around all safe and sound. The youngsters seemed to find joy in everything they did, even when things were serious. She smiled and resumed her work with a shake of her head. BAG END HOBBITON The wind continued to pick up even more during the night and now it was snowing. The sudden smack of a tree branch or perhaps something else against the window of his room had stirred him from his slumber. Frodo pulled the blankets up to his chin and settled back into the warmth, trying to recapture the lovely dream he'd been having. Bilbo was back and everyone was together for Yule. Frodo was much younger and filled with the wonder of the celebration as only a child can be. Gaily decorated tables groaned with bounty, the scent of rich foods filling the air of the smial. He sniffed the air in delighted anticipation. The holly and mistletoe were hung and the warm fire caused beads of sweat to form on his brow, but he didn't mind. The music had begun, and it was soft and low, sweet with the warmth of a summer's sun. The voices of his family murmured around him and there, in the corner of the parlour in his favourite chair, sat Bilbo, regarding them all with a customary twinkle in his eyes. It was perfect, all of it, and he wished to settle back into his dream and remain there. Soon, he was asleep again. The insistent rapping at the front door forced him from his warm bed at last. Frodo peered out a window at the blowing snow and rubbed at his bleary eyes. He glanced at the clock on the mantle. Midnight. Who would be fool enough to come calling this late, and in the middle of a blizzard, no less? Frodo pulled the round, green door open; it was difficult in the screaming wind, but at last he managed. On the doorstep huddled a small, shivering form wrapped tightly in a cloak. ""Whatever are you doing here?"" Frodo cried, his alarm increasing when he realised who it was and pulled him inside. ""Get in here, it's freezing out there! What, surely you're not alone?"" Pippin giggled into his mittened hands. ""Of course not!"" He gestured over his shoulder at the glistening world beyond Bag End. ""Look at what I've done!"" Frodo stared where his little cousin pointed, his eyes widening at the sight. ""Oh, Pippin,"" he breathed and knelt to embrace the child. ""What have you done?"""
244,2,14,2-CEShaughnessy-14.txt,lord-of-the-rings,CEShaughnessy,"Frodo looked around, missing the little one for the first time. ""I'm going to kill him!"" Merry's face was as red as an overripe tomato. ""No, I get to kill him first, then you can kill him!"" Frodo scowled. ""How are we going to get all the way home without being seen?"" He studied their surroundings closely trying to come up with an idea. ""Perhaps we'll have to wait for nightfall."" ""Frodo, that's hours away! I have to be home before then or I'll be in trouble,"" Sam moaned. ""Not nearly as much trouble as you're in right now, Sam."" Frodo reminded him wryly. ""There has to be something we can do! I know, let's get lots of leafy branches--"" ""Wait! I have an idea!"" Merry looked at the little boat and then at the others. He grinned. ""We'll hold the boat in front of us as we walk."" ""Oh, that'll be just fine until someone comes along behind us, Merry."" Frodo was not impressed. ""Well, do you have any better ideas?"" Frodo glanced around again and finally sighed in defeat. ""No."" ""Let's go then."" They hoisted the little boat and began to carry it up the path. Three nervous and very naked hobbits kept their eyes wide open for travelers as they made their way carefully toward home. Sam was moaning quietly under his breath while Merry and Frodo muttered about all the creative ways they planned to get back at Pippin for humiliating them. They had walked nearly all the way to Bag End, ducking behind trees when they heard voices, and dodging around bushes when they only thought they heard voices. They swung the boat this way and that, each of them tugging for more cover. As they finally neared the road leading home a familiar mischievous laughter erupted from above. Pippin leaped down gracefully from the tree branch on which he'd been perching as he tracked their progress and landed a few feet ahead of them. ""Oh my! Why are you lads carrying the boat all the way up here?"" He snickered knowingly. At the same moment quiet giggling floated toward them from the opposite direction. It was unmistakably female. None of them possessed the courage to turn around and see just who was so amused. Each was painfully aware of their bare bottoms on display for all to see. They stopped in mid-flight, unsure of which way to turn. Pippin egged them on. Reaching into his pack he pulled out some of the missing clothing and taunted them. ""Did you lads misplace your britches? Because I found a whole pile of clothes,"" he pointed the way they had come, ""just over there!"" ""Get him!"" Merry roared, forgetting his delicate situation in a mad desire for revenge. He dropped his end of the boat causing Sam and Frodo to lose their own grip. It proved to be their undoing. A mighty shriek echoed up the lane as the boat crashed to the ground. Merry stared in absolute mortification at the sight before him. There in the middle of the road stood the object of his affection along with May Gamgee, both lasses with hands pressed to their mouths, eyes gaping at the sight of the three naked hobbits who were momentarily frozen in place. The sound of Pippin's laughter brought them careening back to reality and they added their own shrieks to the din as they ran into the woods. More laughter rang in their ears as they scurried behind some bushes and huddled together. Pippin grinned at May and Peony. ""I…guess I'd better go get Bilbo to help these poor naked lads get home."" ""Did you hear that?"" Merry fumed. ""I'm going to kill him!"" ""Not before I do,"" growled Frodo. Sam whimpered. ""Oh, we're never going to live this down!"" Laughter rang loud and long through the camp and several of them wiped tears from their eyes. ""Pippin! You took their clothes? Shame on you!"" Boromir could not contain his merriment. Pippin grinned wickedly at the big man before looking at his fellow hobbits. ""But the best part was that I really didn't know the lasses were headed down that way!"" Sam winced at the memory. ""Aye, you couldn't have planned it any better had you tried."" ""Oh, but poor Merry! The lass you'd made eyes at! I can only imagine the embarrassment you suffered."" Boromir was shaking his head in sympathy. ""Hmmph! But we saw to it Pippin got his comeuppance, didn't we?"" Merry winked at Frodo and Sam as he nodded at his cousin. ""I'm certain I don't know what you're referring to Merry,"" Pippin sniffed. ""Yes, in a way Pippin was doubly embarrassed in the end."" Frodo told them with no small sense of satisfaction. ""Not only did Bilbo soundly paddle his very deserving backside at last, and in front of us…"" ""To help make up for the pain and suffering inflicted by our extremely inconsiderate imp of a cousin…"" Merry continued. ""The next morning we tackled him before Bilbo was up…"" Frodo chuckled. ""We took his nightshirt and locked him out of Bag End!"" Merry grinned in triumph. ""The lasses all thought it was very funny, especially May and Peony."" ""Oh no! Did they see him?"" Boromir couldn't believe his ears. ""Oh, aye!"" Sam said. ""They heard all the shouting and banging on the door up at Bag End and came running to see what was happening. Actually, I was already on my way to the garden when I saw a very naked lad being tossed out the bedroom window!"" ""Not only was Pip caught out naked, like we were, but the lasses got to see what a nice red bottom he'd got for his trouble!"" Merry crowed. Boromir regarded the blushing hobbit thoughtfully. ""This was supposed to be a story where you came out unscathed? Pip, I can't imagine what it would be like if you were actually the guilty party!"" Pippin sniffed. ""It's all about perspective Boromir."" END"
245,2,28,2-CEShaughnessy-28.txt,lord-of-the-rings,CEShaughnessy,"for many a month after that incident,"" Paladin chuckled. ""And there wasn't any lad in the entire Shire who was happier to see his cousins, as I was when they caught up with me at last. I knew they were of a mind to scold me soundly for my rash behaviour but they just couldn't bring themselves to after I had fallen overboard. Or, so they told me later."" He laughed again. ""They even defended me to your Granda because I had been so obviously panic stricken. So, after all was said and done, my father decided I had been punished enough by the experience itself. And because I had lost my beloved Sammy."" Father and son remained quiet for several moments. Finally, Pippin spoke in a soft voice; ""I'd feel so dreadful if I lost Tulip like that. And I'm so sorry you lost your friend, Da!"" Paladin patted his son's arm and handed him Tulip. ""Thank you, lad. Just try to remember that all of our actions carry consequences, and some may be more serious than we can imagine at the time. What if there had been a stray pitchfork lying in that hay? Or if you had cracked your head much harder? Or…well, I think you've got my meaning."" Pippin nodded, his face solemn now. ""I'm sorry for scaring you and Mum."" Paladin closed his eyes for a few seconds, and then met his son's bright eyes with his own. ""I'm simply asking you to think harder and longer before you act, Pippin."" ""Yes, I know."" ""Good!"" They both looked up as Eglantine pushed the door open with her hip and placed a heavily laden tray on the foot of the bed. Paladin whistled. ""Your mother, as usual, has outdone herself."" Pippin bobbed his head with equal enthusiasm and gestured for someone to hurry up and give him something to eat. Eglantine pulled up a chair and began preparing a plate for her son. ""Mum!"" Pippin tried to bounce up and down, but dislodged Tulip from her perch and was scolded roundly by the knitted piglet. ""Sorry, Tulip."" Pippin tenderly placed her back on her pillow. ""Da just told me a story about his Sammy-Lambie."" ""Oh? And what story was that, Pad?"" Eglantine lifted her brow in question. ""The one when I lost Sammy in the Brandywine. You've heard it before, Tina."" Paladin winked at his wife covertly. ""Ah, yes. So I have."" She handed Pippin his plate. ""Eat your luncheon now, my lads, before anything gets cold."" She didn't have to tell them twice. *** Eglantine watched her husband head down the hallway with the tray of dishes from their meal. ""Sammy-Lambie? The stuffed sheep your sisters teased you so much about because he went everywhere with you."" ""The very same."" Eglantine followed him. ""But Pad, you told me that you lads all went out in the boat knowing full well you weren't allowed to. And it was your cousin Milo who actually fell in, wasn't it? As I recall the story, the older lads were teasing you and snatched your toy away, and sometime during all the shenanigans of grabbing for him, Sammy got flung overboard and Milo ended up following him. He didn't just decide to leap in and go for a swim on his own. Milo or Sammy either one, that is!"" Paladin looked at her a bit shamefacedly after placing his burden on the kitchen table. ""Well…I thought my story gave Sammy a rather more dramatic ending. And it was a good way to make an important point with Peregrin. Maybe while he's busy being concerned with the well-being of his piggy, he'll keep himself out of more messes while he's at it."" Paladin gave her a wide grin. ""Hmm, and perhaps you should tell Pippin you were being disobedient, and not heroic as you made yourself out to be?"" Eglantine chuckled. ""And the way you lads' parents really reacted to your wee voyage, eh?"" Paladin snorted. ""That, my dear, wouldn't have been nearly as much fun for me!"" ""Hmm, I suppose not. Well now, would you like me to make you another Sammy-Lambie, Pad? Then perhaps you and your son might go do a bit of sightseeing, and show your wee friends the lay of the land around the Took farm?"" She gave him a wink. ""You never know, it could be a great deal of fun."" ""There's a thought, now."" Paladin pretended to consider the notion. ""Just be certain you make him very fat and fluffy though, just like the first Sammy. With a small spot of black,"" he pointed to his nose, ""just about here on the left side of his muzzle. Oh! And be sure to make him a collar. The original Sammy-Lambie had a very nice one that Mum knitted to go along with it…"" Paladin continued to add items to the list as he followed his wife into the kitchen. ""…'twas blue and green entwined, as I recall. My favourite colours, you know. Also, you might-"" Eglantine stopped and turned, placing a hand over his mouth. ""Dearest, any more of this and I'm going to start believing you're serious! Well, I know without a doubt now where Pippin gets most of his imagination and his ability to talk non-stop."" Eglantine chuckled as she started to gather up the dishes and carry them to the sink. ""I always did suspect it was from your side of the family."" ""Tina, perhaps you could knit a Sammy-Lambie? I have missed that stuffed sheep so much all these years, and it…"" Paladin's voice trailed off. ""What?"" ""Paladin Took! Have you gone 'round the bend on me, lad?"" ""For Pippin, I mean! He can add it to his collection of farm animals. Oh, mercy, you didn't think that I actually wanted it for myself?"" ""Oh! Well then, maybe I'll see what I can do."" Eglantine laughed as she turned to the sink, missing the twinkle of delight in her husband's eyes."
246,2,10,2-CEShaughnessy-10.txt,lord-of-the-rings,CEShaughnessy,"Pippin howled his dismay. Tomias dropped to the ground beside him. ""Are you all right lad?"" His eyes were wide with fear. Pippin's wails brought several people rushing into the barn to see what had happened. Even Pansy the goose stuck her head around the corner of a stall to see who had dared to bother her. Never having cared for crowds the big goose (Would a farm goose not have clipped wings? Nope! Not on my husband's farm!) took off in a cloud of feathers beating her great wings in the air, her indignation at the disturbance very clear. Paladin hurried to his son's side and dropped to his knee beside Tomias. He placed a hand on his son's brow and brushed the thick hair aside examining the small cut to his forehead. It was bleeding slightly. Pippin's cries had stopped and he stared up at his audience. ""Are you all right son?"" Pippin nodded and was about to speak when his father placed his arms around him and lifted him carefully out of the mess. Holding him away from himself Paladin headed for the pump outside the barn and put the youngster down on the bench. Drawing a handkerchief from his pocket he dipped it into the cold water someone was already pumping into a bucket and carefully applied it to the cut. ""Oww, that hurts,"" Pippin yelped, batting his father's hand away. ""Whatever happened?"" Eglantine asked as she joined them, Pearl close at her side. She bent to examine her son's injury taking hold of his flailing hands while Paladin tended to him. ""He just darted out from behind one of the stalls rather suddenly Missus Took."" Tomias's voice was shaky. ""Next thing I knew he yelled out something at me and the next,"" he shook his head in wonder, ""he was on the ground."" Since everyone was used to Pippin's shenanigans no one was all that surprised. ""He grabbed for the shovel to steady himself I think, and it landed on his head. I'm sorry Mr Took, I couldn't catch the handle in time."" ""That's all right lad, he'll be fine."" Paladin proceeded to clean the small cut thoroughly. He looked up at his wife and daughter and winked, laughing, ""He doesn't smell all that fine though."" Eglantine took charge. ""Pearl, go and prepare a bath for your brother will you please? Pad, rinse him off well before I take him inside and-"" A wail of protest interrupted her instructions. ""Not two baths in one day!"" Eglantine lifted an eyebrow and looked her son up and down impatiently. ""Aye, and possibly three if I think the occasion calls for it, young sir."" She hoisted him to his feet by one arm, wrinkling up her nose as she pulled. ""And perhaps even a wee bit of flowery scent for behind your ears if we can't get all the smell off of you. Oh my, whew. How you reek!"" Laughter erupted around them causing Pippin to scowl at the onlookers. Paladin chuckled as he poured a pail of water over his son's back. ""Da! It isn't funny!"" Pippin squirmed to get away. ""And that's cold!"" ""Ah well now, it's a sight better'n smelling like cow manure, isn't it?"" Paladin grinned as he lifted another bucket and poured this one down Pippin's front. ""Daaaaaa!"" ""Come now my lad, your sister's got a hot bath just about ready for you. With a great deal of soap."" Eglantine took him by the arm making certain to hold him away from her as she marched him towards the smial. ""Wait!"" Pippin struggled to get away. ""What is it now? You're filthy and cold so we'll be doing no more delaying,"" his mother scolded. ""Tulip! I want my piggy, Mum!"" His mother glanced at the others in dismay. ""She didn't join you in the muck bath did she now? Because if that's the case…"" ""No, she jumped off my shoulder before I fell."" ""Will someone kindly look for piggy and return her home then?"" Eglantine gripped Pippin's arm firmly and started off again. A chorus of ""I want my pig!"" could still be heard as Pippin was tugged away smartly. ""Ah, me. Well, I best be finding that missing piggy before he drives his mother to distraction."" Paladin finished washing under the pump and then strolled into the barn. He met Pervinca as she was coming out. She held the knitted pig out to her father. ""Is this what he's wailing about now Da?"" ""Aye, take it in and give it to him, will you Vinca? There's a good lass."" Pervinca snorted. ""He's been talking to it all morning you know. And acting like it talks back to him. He's so silly."" She trotted off with the knitted piglet slung over her shoulder dangling by its curly tail. The sun was high in the sky when Pippin decided to do as Tulip suggested and go for a walk to soothe his disgruntled mood. Two baths in a single day indeed! He felt himself fortunate to have at least avoided the threatened rose scent behind his ears. Nevertheless he had suffered a noteworthy scrubbing at the hands of his mother and sister. A sojourn into the meadows around their home was just what he needed to take his mind off the strong scent of soap. He deposited some food in a handkerchief, tucked piggy into his shirt and set out across the meadow. Not far into his hike he began to hum a tune. Inside his shirt Tulip joined him in singing the chorus. Pippin marvelled at how well they harmonized together as he marched happily on his way in search of berries and adventure. It wasn't long before he had strayed as far as he was allowed to go by himself but many a passing butterfly distracted him as he continued along the narrowing path. Inside his shirt Tulip decided not to remind him as he passed the boundaries of his family's farm."
247,2,1,2-CEShaughnessy-1.txt,lord-of-the-rings,CEShaughnessy,"a momentous and happy revelation, or…"" Boromir's voice fell to a whisper, ""a catastrophe."" The big man sat up straight and chuckled merrily. ""Of course sometimes the cat was simply sleepy, having been allowed to feast on all the fine foods she was rewarded with!"" Groans emanated from his own audience and he grinned. Holding up a hand he stopped their protests. ""However, on one such occasion Hithfaer sat upon the picture of a great storm cloud and stared hard at her admirers. Then she lifted her paw and began to wash her whiskers. And then her paw travelled higher and higher until…"" Boromir paused for effect before whispering, ""she preened the back of both of her ears!"" Pippin gaped at him, finally speaking. ""Yes? And what is the significance of that? My kitty does that every time I feed her,"" Pippin snorted. ""Yes, but your cat cannot predict the future, can she?"" Boromir asked. ""No, of course not! Well, not that I am aware of anyway. But my da says when a cat washes her face and reaches over both her ears with her paw it means we're to expect visitors."" ""But not in Gondor! In my country when a cat washes behind both ears with a single paw it means one of two things."" ""Aye, either she wants clean ears or you're having company!"" ""Nay Pippin. And remember, she was seated on the image of the great storm cloud at the time, and for some hours, which made her prediction twice as ominous."" Boromir glanced around the circle of listeners solemnly. ""The Interpreter told the people Hithfaer had foreseen a great storm of terrible proportions and they would have to abandon the city for a distant refuge in order to save their lives. The storm was foretold to strike within two days because the Soothsayer had sat upon the picture for exactly two hours. Oh! The people worked themselves up into a state of frenzy and fled to their homes to prepare to abandon the great city quickly. Even the queen and her servants flew about in a state of terror packing their belongings and making ready to leave."" The little group fell quiet. Finally Frodo spoke. ""And the Royal Interpreter? What did he do?"" ""He watched and waited, pretending to make his own preparations. Then, at the opportune moment when all but he had fled the city, he leisurely gathered up much of the Queen's riches and packed them carefully into his waggon and on the back of his horse. He was in no hurry of course. He had been cheerfully making up all the cat's predictions over the years whilst he laughed at the foolish people behind their backs and prepared for this day. Oddly though, Hithfaer had reappeared in the castle and Barukan was at a loss to explain her presence for she had been packed off along with the silly queen and the other cats. As he passed by the chamber where the feline had held audience all those years he noticed she was crouched once more on the image of the huge storm cloud, washing behind her ears. 'Fools!' he snorted with an evil laugh as he exited the castle."" Boromir paused and looked slowly around the circle of his companions. The hobbits watched him, wide-eyed, forgetting their initial scepticism. Pippin held his breath. Boromir grinned wickedly. ""As Barukan rode away he happened to glance up. He saw Hithfaer perched upon the highest tower staring down at him while she washed behind both ears with one paw. The next moment a great wind blew into the city followed by a sudden downpour. The sky darkened to black and a clap of thunder loud enough to wake the very dead echoed throughout the city! Barukan looked this way and that, his fear rising. His horse reared in terror and caused the heavily laden waggon to tilt precariously, spilling some of the queen's treasure upon the ground. Barukan dismounted and hastily retrieved his stolen goods, throwing them back into the waggon. Meanwhile, from her vantage point upon the great tower, Hithfaer continued to stare at the robber with great distaste. As Barukan clambered back onto his horse his eye caught sight of the soothsaying feline once more. Legend says that her stony gaze enabled the man to catch a glimpse into another world and he knew in that moment what his fate was to be! The evil Interpreter cried out his anger and rage as a bolt of lightening struck him squarely in the chest and claimed his life. Hithfaer watched his demise with interest and at last rested her paw on the stone turret. She shook her sleek tortoiseshell head and stood, muttering to herself. 'Fool,' she spat."" Laughter erupted from the appreciative listeners and Pippin clapped his hands. ""Oh my! So the mysterious kitty knew what was going on all along."" ""Yes indeed. In this tale the cat was victorious and so was the queen because she did not lose her riches,"" Boromir nodded. ""Unlike evil Queen Beruthiel and her felines."" Aragorn shook his head. ""An extremely interesting tale, Boromir. I shall remember it."" ""Aye, very interesting tale indeed."" Pippin sat back and considered the story for a moment. Around him the others began to prepare for their day's rest. ""Boromir?"" ""Yes, Pip?"" The big man halted and looked down at the halfling. ""You never said what the other thing was. You remember, you mentioned that in Gondor when a cat washes behind her ears with a single paw it meant one of two things? A catastrophe or …?"" Boromir smiled at his small friend. ""That's right. It signifies a great catastrophe. Often it is a death by accident, like Barukan's."" Pippin tilted his head to one side. ""Or?"" Boromir raised his brow and chuckled softly. ""Or 'tis about to rain!"" The voices of the entire Fellowship rose in a great harmony of gentle laughter and drifted through the canopy high above them."
248,2,16,2-CEShaughnessy-16.txt,lord-of-the-rings,CEShaughnessy,"putting my hands in the water, that is until Frodo told me to stop it and then I had to--"" ""I told you to stop it because you were leaning too far over the edge Pip,"" Frodo interrupted. ""I was not! I've been very, very good, Frodo."" Pippin was indignant. ""Yes, you rascal, you have been awfully good today and I shall be certain to let Bilbo know. All right? Come now, I think it's about time we packed up and headed back."" Without a protest Merry and Sam began gathering their things and taking down the little tent. It had been a very pleasant afternoon. Even Pippin didn't argue as he joined in to help. He finished by lifting the little quiver onto his back and gripping the bow as he prepared to follow the others. Frodo halted. ""Pippin,"" he began. ""I just want to carry it back! I'll give it to Bilbo, I promise. Please, Frodo?"" ""All right. Just don't be shooting any arrows along the way, you hear?"" ""Of course not!"" Sam leaned over and whispered in Merry's ear. ""Do you think it might be safer if we walk behind Pippin?"" Merry chuckled and nodded. ""That's not a bad idea, Sam."" Bilbo was outside enjoying his pipe as the little entourage struggled up the path with their gear. He glanced up and smiled, the smile turning into a frown when he saw what Pippin carried. Bilbo turned a questioning eye to his nephew. Frodo held up his hands in a placating gesture. ""Before you say anything, we didn't know he had them! And I made certain he played with them safely. In fact, we all had a turn. I told Pip he'd have to give them to you when we returned and that we'd have to let his mother know he brought them with him without permission."" ""Hmm!"" Bilbo looked down at the youngster sternly. Pippin smiled winningly up at him, hopeful that the older hobbit wouldn't scold him too much. Bilbo sighed. Never a dull moment with this one around. ""I suppose there's no harm done. Well young sir! Is there anything else up your sleeve that I should know about?"" Pippin shook his head vigorously from side to side. ""All right then, why don't you all get washed up for supper then? Samwise, I've spoken to your father and you have permission to dine with us if you'd like."" ""If I'd like?"" Sam could not contain the huge grin. It had been a long while since he'd been able to have so much time to while away with friends. ""Thank you Mr Bilbo, sir. That's lovely!"" ""Well, come on then!"" Bilbo gestured to the door. He halted Pippin on his way in and confiscated the small bow and quiver, cringing inwardly at the little rascal's ability to put one over on him. Pippin frowned as he gave up his beloved plaything, but knew better than to protest. The week actually passed by quickly, a fact that surprised even Bilbo. The last day of the visit was at hand and Bilbo was taking the lads in to Hobbiton for lunch as a farewell treat. Sam would be unable to join them since the heat had abated and he was back at work in the gardens helping his father. Pippin excitedly counted his pennies over and over as he sat in the little pony cart with his cousins. ""Pennies for a sunny day!"" His sing-song voice repeated again and again. ""Pippin, will you stop singing about your money?"" Merry pleaded. ""Or at least change the tune."" Pippin grinned up at him. ""I saved and saved and my mum wouldn't let me spend any of my pennies for a long time."" And she doesn't even know I have these! Pippin giggled at his resourcefulness. ""Yes, well aren't you glad? You have ten whole pennies to spend now. That's quite a lot of money, isn't it?"" Bilbo smiled down at his little charge. ""Aye! And it's all mine,"" Pippin chortled. ""What, you aren't going to share with your poorer cousins?"" Frodo hid a grin as he said this. Pippin stared at him disbelievingly. ""Of course I'm going to share it Frodo Baggins! How could you think I wouldn't?"" Pippin was insulted. Frodo put an arm around him. ""Naturally Pip. We know how generous you are, don't we Merry?"" Merry grinned. ""Of course we do."" He placed an arm around Pippin also. ""And we're going to miss you when you leave tomorrow. Say, since you're feeling so generous, how about lending me your bow and arrows? I'd take really good care of them."" ""Merry."" Frodo looked at his cousin disapprovingly. ""What? I just thought--"" ""Uh huh. And I just think that's a bad idea, young Meriadoc,"" Bilbo interrupted them. ""At least as long as you're staying at Bag End where I'm responsible for you. So I'd just be forgetting that notion my lad."" Merry sighed and rolled his eyes at Bilbo. ""You just had to try, didn't you?"" Frodo laughed. ""I'll bring them next time I visit Merry!"" Pippin assured him. ""With your mum's permission,"" Frodo reminded him. ""Well, I hope that's soon then!"" Merry startled himself. ""I can't believe I just said that,"" he muttered. ""I'll ask mum if I can stay longer now!"" Pippin giggled, and bounced up and down, delighted with his idea. ""You know, she just may let me. She says she's always able to get so much done when I'm visiting with relatives and you can tell her how much you like having me here and how lonely you'd be without me and we still have so much more we could do and then we could take that long hike in the meadow that we never got to do because it was too hot…."" Pippin paused to take a deep breath and continued, ""And Bilbo can take us into Hobbiton more than this one time and…"" All three of them groaned, Merry the loudest. END"

Familiar faces surrounded him, concerned. ""I, I'm sorry,"" he whispered, mortified that his night terrors had disturbed them again. Frodo began to weep uncontrollably, small shoulders shaking, his head in his hands. Sam enveloped him in a hug of fierce protection. ""There, Mr Frodo. You're all right now. You're here with us. We won't allow anything to harm you."" Pippin crawled bodily over Sam to join in the embrace and Merry scooted closer. Frodo found he was cocooned in a circle of comforting hugs and warmth. He looked up to find Aragorn watching him kindly. He smiled sadly and then reached to peel Pippin off his neck. ""Are you going to be all right Frodo? Oh my, you scared us so bad! That bloodcurdling scream was awful."" ""I'm sorry, Pip."" Frodo regarded them with a weak smile. ""Thank you all once more for your concern. I am…better now. My apologies for waking you once again."" He shook his head. Aragorn took Frodo's hand and spoke softly. ""The ring is compounding your emotions, Frodo. Remember, it feeds on negative feelings and you are so filled with emotion I fear it is responsible for the night terrors you have been suffering."" He took a deep breath and added, ""It may grow worse as we draw nearer to our destination."" Frodo studied the Ranger's face for a long moment. ""I had wondered if that might be so. It is really not a great surprise."" He sat up straighter and faced them all. ""Never fear. I will endure. I promise you all."" ""And we will all be here to assist you,"" Aragorn laid a gentle hand upon his shoulder and gazed about the circle of worried faces. ""Now, once more we must attempt to gain some additional rest. Lay down Frodo. Sam, stay close if you please. Merry and Pippin, back to bed now."" As the Company settled in once more Aragorn took up the watch at the side of the river. Legolas joined him and they stood gazing across the water in companionable silence for a time. Aragorn spoke at last. ""I am afraid I will be unable to get back to sleep."" The elf nodded in understanding. ""Shall we share the watch then?"" His companion tilted his head in agreement and indicated the path that lay around the edge of the woods. ""Walk with me."" They walked for a time before Aragorn spoke once more. ""Frodo was chosen for this task for a purpose. I have faith he will accomplish what he has set out to do."" ""As do I. However, he will face many trying challenges along the way, as we all shall. And his kin now realize that much more is at risk than they knew before. They are finding his dreams most distressing. They must learn to trust in their own instincts if we are to remain strong and whole."" ""That is very true. In spite of their youth I believe it is a blessing that Frodo's kin accompanied him on this journey. Concern for their well-being motivates Frodo's will to succeed."" The Ring-bearer tossed restlessly in his sleep for the second time and then quieted. A calm seemed to come over him at last and he actually smiled in his dream. The shadows parted and the clouds in the overcast gray sky lifted to reveal the dawning sun. Light filled his being and he sighed softly. The Lady Galadriel bent and brushed a stray lock of dark hair from his brow, her golden radiance lighting his dream from within. Frodo reached up to her and she caressed his hand and then held it against her silken cheek, bestowing a kiss upon the small fingers. Frodo's face lit up with joy as he spied Gandalf standing next to her wearing a flowing white robe. The wizard raised an ivory staff in supplication. Frodo was lulled compassionately back to sleep within his dream, feeling cradled in protection as if he were a newborn babe. The remainder of his night passed without fear or dread. The Fellowship awakened to the first sunny day they had seen since departing from Lothlorien. The brief respite of a cloudless morning was a balm for their souls. Smiles appeared on faces that had been mournful and solemn only a few short hours before. ""Why, it reminds me of the first day of spring in the Shire. Almost,"" Sam corrected himself. ""Leastways, it is good to see the sun at last."" ""Indeed, that is an understatement Samwise!"" Aragorn agreed heartily as the Company prepared for the day's journey. ""This reminds me of when we celebrated the Winter-Fylleth, early in our journey."" Sam added. ""Aye, more turning points Frodo!"" ""But now we're looking ahead to Astron. Rather than the coming of winter, which will soon be in the past, we are looking ahead to the rebirth of spring,"" Sam said. ""But you're right Pip. More turning points,"" Merry agreed. ""Is anything the matter Frodo?"" Sam watched his friend with concern. ""Oh, I was just thinking about the meaning of turning points Sam. It's odd because we are actually traveling toward a greater darkness in Mordor. I don't feel much like divination at the moment."" Frodo's smile faded a bit despite the positive words. Merry patted his cousin on the shoulder. ""But also remember that the solstice is about the celebration of the cycles of nature. A positive thing. Why, it's a reaffirmation that life continues! And that spring always follows winter,"" he added more quietly, gazing meaningfully into Frodo's eyes. His cousin smiled slightly. It was difficult if not nigh impossible to fool Merry. ""And with the spring comes regeneration of life. And a renewal of strength and resolve."" Frodo looked around at the Fellowship and straightened his shoulders, smiling slightly. ""Come, let us begin a new day."" END"
250,2,5,2-CEShaughnessy-5.txt,lord-of-the-rings,CEShaughnessy,"and best laying hens! And it wasn't even dinnertime… Later that afternoon the downcast youngster sprawled in the grass beneath the oak that held his swing, his ever-present knitted friend perched on his shoulder trying to comfort him. He had failed at everything he'd tried today, even though he had given it his best effort. He studied his fingers, still sore from poking them with the sewing needle, and rubbed at the scratch on his forehead, received when he'd tried to encourage Lily to come back down from the tree. He had a scraped knee, a bruised shin, and a sore bum where Pansy had bit him. But all of that was nothing compared to his wounded dignity. He'd made a mess of the mending, scattered his sister's hard work in the garden all over the yard, not to mention destroying her basket by falling on it, and trampled his mother's flower garden while trying to pull out some unrelenting weeds. Ones he'd discovered after the fact, were not weeds at all, but new seedlings placed there only the day before. He'd broken all the eggs, hit Dizzy with the pup's own ball while playing fetch, scared Lily high up into the oak tree quite unintentionally, thrown Tulip into a rubbish bin…and to top it all off he had accidentally killed a prize chicken with a garden rake! ""Even you feel sorry for me,"" he moaned, scratching behind Tulip's ears. She responded by grunting and nuzzling his cheek. ""Why can't I do anything right?"" Tulip's heart melted and she hastened to remind him of all the things he had done well, but it seemed of little consolation to him. Pippin rolled over on his stomach, placed his face in the crook of his arm and began to sob. Distressed in the extreme, Tulip sat next to him patting his shoulder with her hoof and murmuring in his ear. ""Here now, what's all this about?"" Pippin only cried harder at the sound of his father's soothing voice. Paladin was on his way in from the fields and had no clue what a busy day his son had. ""Pippin, what's wrong, boy?"" When he didn't receive an answer he sat next to him and scooped the lad into his arms, rocking him back and forth until he calmed. Finally, he drew back and cupped the quivering chin in his hand, studying his face with concern. ""What happened?"" Pippin burst into tears all over again and threw his arms around his father's neck. ""Daaa…"" Pippin drew a great gulping breath and then the words came tumbling out nonstop, so fast that Paladin had difficulty understanding just what his son was trying to say. At last, the tears slowed and he had caught enough of his son's distressed explanation to get the general idea of the problem. ""Ah, so my lad had a very difficult day then, I take it?"" He felt the damp face nodding against his now equally damp shirt, and he smiled, pulling Pippin closer. ""Well now, we all have days like that, m'lad. Not to worry. I guarantee you everything will look brighter in the morning."" ""But…but, I'm not good at anything! Everything I tried to do today turned out bad!"" Pippin sniffed and wiped his face on his sleeve. Paladin withdrew a handkerchief and gave it to him. ""Now, I'll just wager you're exaggerating that, Pippin."" ""No, I'm not!"" ""You had a very trying day, that's all. We all do sometimes. No one's going to hold what happened against you."" ""But Da – I killed Mum's best chicken,"" Pippin wailed. ""Aye, so you said."" Paladin rubbed his chin thoughtfully. ""Hmm. And what did your mother have to say about it?"" ""We're having chicken for supper,"" the youngster wailed again. Paladin laughed aloud and held his son close. ""Ah, and so is the way of life on the farm, lad. You know that. Now dry your tears, eh? If all you're worried about is finding a task you'll be good at, then I've got just the thing in mind!"" Pippin drew back and sniffed, studying his father curiously. ""What?"" ""Well,"" Paladin said, reaching down to scoop up Tulip and place her back inside his son's shirt, ""come with me and I'll show you. It's the same job I was given to do at around your age, and as I recall, I became quite expert at it."" Pippin took the hand he was offered and trotted along at his father's side. Several hours later Eglantine came out to tell them supper was being put on the table. She smiled at her beaming son as he looked up from his labor. ""Why, it looks as though you've done a fine job cleaning all this tack, m'lad! Your father is going to be very pleased. Who showed you how to do it?"" Just then Paladin came around the corner of the barn, wiping his hands on a rag. ""Da taught me,"" Pippin declared with no small amount of pride. He ran to his father and put his arms around him and Paladin hoisted him up. ""Da says I'm a natural. And I can help with keeping the tack clean all the time."" ""Oh, is that so?"" Eglantine chuckled. ""Well, I'm certain everyone will be very happy to have your help, Pippin."" ""Oh, mercy yes! We can use all the help we can get. After all, there's plenty of it to be tended to, isn't there lad?"" Paladin winked at his wife over Pippin's shoulder. ""Why, you're going to be even better at it than I was at your age, I'm very sure."" Paladin put him down. ""Now, go wash your hands and get Tulip and we'll go in to supper. Hurry now, I'm as hungry as three grown hobbits tonight."" ""All right!"" Pippin sprinted away. ""Ahem,"" Paladin looked at his wife and grinned. ""Is it really true we're having chicken tonight, then?"" Eglantine threw her head back and laughed until the tears flowed."

Pearl took his arm firmly in her hand. ""What were you thinking?"" Pimpernel scolded. ""But I got jam on my favouritest scarf that Auntie Esme made for me! I had to wash it,"" he declared. Pearl sighed and pointed him towards the smial. ""Yes, well I see you didn't get any water on yourself though. Come, you're covered from head to foot with your stolen jam and Mum will have a fit when she finds out what you did. Let's get you cleaned up in a hurry."" Pippin trotted obediently along beside his sister, the scarf dripping wet and dragging on the ground. ""Here, let me have that."" Nell bent to retrieve it. ""I'll give it a good wash and hang it out to dry."" ""All right, thanks Nellie! Oww, what are you doing Pearl?"" ""Pippin, just how did you get jam inside your ears?"" Pearl was inspecting him as they walked. ""I don't know!"" Pearl picked up her pace. ""Come, we'll put this soap to good use. You're going to have a bath."" ""A BATH? Pearl, it's the middle of the day! I don't want a bath!"" Pippin's voice faded as Pearl hauled him inside and shut the door. ""Oh, thank goodness he wasn't hurt,"" Pimpernel breathed. ""Aye, that's our Pip. He leads a charmed life, that one,"" Pervinca agreed. The ground looked much further away than he had anticipated and Pippin hesitated for a moment. Still, he was certain he could do it. After all, he'd overheard the big lads discussing how easy it was so surely he'd be able to do it too. The hobbit paused again before taking the thick rope in his small hands. He tested its strength by pulling on it. All set then. He held his breath as tightly as the rope and swung out of the old oak tree by the barn, letting go and landing in the soft mound of hay. Well, now, that wasn't so bad. He grinned, proud of himself, and climbed back up the tree determined to try it from a higher branch like the older lads. With each subsequent leap and successful tumble into the hay Pippin grew more confident and daring. He now climbed up to the very highest branch he could reach and stood teetering upon it. The ground was very far away now. For the briefest of moments fear gripped his heart but he shook it away. He knew he could jump from here without getting hurt. He did not realize that with each jump the hay mound grew less cushioning and he didn't notice the sharp tines of the pitchfork that had been carelessly discarded. Pippin held his breath again and this time he closed his eyes preparing to soar. He leapt into nothingness and felt himself suddenly drawn backwards, the sharp bark of the tree digging into his throat and the scarf choking him, its threads tangled in the tree's branch preventing his fall. ""What?"" He struggled to get out of the tree's grasp and it only seemed to pull his scarf tighter around his neck. He could not free himself no matter how valiantly he struggled, finally forced to call for help. His help appeared in the form of his father whose face paled ashen when he saw what his young son had been about. ""Oh mercy!"" Eglantine was right behind him. Pippin didn't understand what all the fuss was about until after he'd been removed from the tree and hugged to pieces by his frightened family. The scarf's threads were untangled a bit and needed cutting in places in order to free him, but it had quite strangely saved him from a very unhappy ending. Paladin examined it in awe for several long minutes. ""It shouldn't have held his weight, Eglantine! I just don't understand it!"" ""Dearest, let us not question a miracle too closely. Just be thankful he's safe."" ""His scarf saved his life? The very same scarf?"" Boromir shook his head in wonder. Merry nodded vigorously. ""It did."" He glanced at his cousin. ""And now you know why he feels so strongly about it."" Boromir reached over and fingered the delicate fringe as Pippin retrieved it from the stone next to the fire. ""Why, it appears to be in very good shape for all that you have put it through."" Pippin grinned. ""I take care of it. And it takes care of me."" He placed it around his neck and patted it lovingly. ""Merry told you - my very favouritest auntie made it just for me."" Gandalf leaned over and patted Pippin's arm. ""Your scarf has been charmed, my lad. That is why it looks after you."" Pippin's head shot up in surprise at the wizard's words and he stared at him. ""What Gandalf? What are you talking about?"" The wizard had the attention of all now. He chuckled. ""Ah, yes. Well."" He leaned back and retrieved his pipe from beside him and casually began to fill it while he talked. ""I could tell, Peregrin, from the very first time I met you as a very young lad that you would have need of such a thing."" Gandalf raised the pipe and lit it before speaking again. ""When your aunt gave you the scarf and you became so obviously attached to it I recall thinking what better object to cast a spell upon than a gift made with such love and care. I placed a charm for your continued well-being upon it then and there. And it has certainly come in very handy on countless occasions since that time, has it not?"" Pippin patted the little scarf. ""You charmed my scarf Gandalf?"" ""Yes, lad. I did. I can think of no other person who could have benefited so much from such a spell as you, my dear fool of a Took!"" ""Um, thank you Gandalf,"" Pippin said. I think."

He finished taking off his belt and doubled it. Eomer did not move. ""I am waiting,"" Theoden said patiently. Eomer blanched and then moved to do as he was bid. With trembling fingers he loosened his breeches and pushed them down, barely exposing his backside. His uncle cleared his throat. ""The breeches come all the way down young man."" Eomer hurried to obey, not liking the tone his uncle's voice had taken on. He bent gingerly across the foot of the bed and waited in tense silence, his fingers digging into the bedclothes. Theoden took hold of his nephew's shoulder to hold him in place. He raised the belt high before whipping it down across the pale bottom with a loud CRACK! ""OWWWWW! Uncle, that hurts!"" ""That is why it is called a punishment Eomer,"" Theoden told him calmly without altering the intensity of the licking in the least. He easily caught the hand that was thrown back and held onto it. Eomer continued to sob into the quilt as the whipping continued. Just as he was certain he could bear no more the punishment stopped. Theoden tossed the belt aside and gathered his repentant and weeping nephew into his arms. He sat on the bed and drew Eomer down at his side, allowing him to cry until he could find no more tears. Finally he took his chin in hand and tilted the swollen eyes up to meet his. Eomer tried to look away but his uncle would not allow it. ""My boy, do you have any idea why I did that?"" Eomer answered hesitantly, his voice trembling. ""Because I was bad. I almost got my sister killed!"" He began to weep anew. Theoden gathered him closer and hugged him fiercely to his chest. ""No, boy. What you did was a very foolish and ill-considered thing. That does not make you bad!"" His uncle's words caused him to sob harder. ""I'm sorry Uncle!"" ""Shhh, it is all right. You have paid for your mischief. All is forgiven."" Eomer clung to his uncle still unable to control his tears. Theoden rocked him gently. ""I was remiss in my failure to punish you for your previous naughtiness. I ask your forgiveness for that. It will not happen again."" A small, muffled groan came from his nephew, whose face was still buried in his chest. ""It won't?"" ""Nay, my boy. It will not. Rest assured. You will have my complete and undivided attention and swiftly, for any future wrongdoing you may be considering,"" Theoden chuckled and pulled back. ""Now, pull up your breeches and dry your tears. Your sister will want to be reassured that I have not been too hard on you."" Theoden stood and retrieved his belt. He replaced it while watching Eomer as he righted his clothing, and then headed for the door. He paused, his hand on the latch. ""I love you my boy,"" he said without turning. ""I love you too Uncle,"" Eomer murmured shyly. The room remained quiet as Eowyn finished speaking. She pulled her attention back to the present a bit reluctantly and glanced at Faramir. He seemed lost in his own thoughts. Eowyn looked around at the others. The wizard was the first to respond. ""That tale was quite lovely my dear Lady. It seems you and your brother found the place where you belonged at last. Theoden had great love for you both, you know. Right from the very beginning."" ""I know,"" Eowyn agreed softly. She smiled, her face lighting up and seeming to reflect the golden brilliance of her hair. ""I miss him dearly."" Merry watched her unobtrusively, forever fascinated by her beauty and manner. He had been held captivated by her ever since she had hoisted him onto her horse the day they rode toward battle, defying her uncle's directives to both of them. She had held his unshakable faith and allegiance ever since. He rose then and approached her, offering his gift to her a bit shyly. Eowyn looked up in surprise. ""My Lady? I made this for you. To help you remember the happier times in your life."" He looked at Eowyn, gray eyes earnest. ""I overheard you tell others that the star Frodo created reminded you so much of a past Yuletide of great importance."" He glanced down at his feet before raising his eyes to hers again. ""I hoped it would cause you to smile."" Eowyn studied the hobbit with gentle eyes before taking the shiny little package and undoing the carefully tied bow. She gasped with wonder as she pulled forth a tiny replica of the silvery star that perched atop the great evergreen. In the same design his cousin had created, Merry had fashioned a necklace with a star shaped charm at the end. Eowyn held it up appreciatively to the light, admiring its delicate filigree as she turned it this way and that. She reached out and gathered the halfling into her arms giving him a heartfelt hug much to the young one's delight. ""Thank you Merry,"" she whispered in his ear. ""Your thoughtful gift will do much to help me recall that even when there is great darkness the light is waiting always, lingering just around the nearest corner, only seeking the proper time to make its appearance and allow its warmth to be felt."" Eowyn let her eyes wander around the room, taking in each beloved face in turn before coming back to her little friend. ""The light of love and friendship. And the memories of those who have gone before us."" ""And await our coming,"" Faramir finished for her. ""Why should they be out of mind just because they are out of sight?"" ""Aye, they are waiting for us somewhere very near, just around the corner,"" Merry agreed. ""All is well."" Afteryule -- Hobbit word for January"
253,2,20,2-CEShaughnessy-20.txt,lord-of-the-rings,CEShaughnessy,"there just as pretty as you please. Why'd you leave her in with the chickens, lad? Why, I think she scared old Rosie just about half to death! I know she gave me a frightful start, she did!"" Periwinkle laughed hard. ""I never expected to find a wee knitted piglet amongst the eggs, after all."" ""Umm, thanks Peri,"" Pippin said. ""Here now lad, as long as you're out here you might as well make yourself useful."" She handed him one of the filled baskets and Pippin accepted it readily. ""Take that in to your mum for me, there's a good lad."" Pippin tucked Tulip back in his shirt and headed back, the basket of carrots swinging easily back and forth as he pondered. ""So, you were in amongst the chickens?"" he chortled, ""I'd like to have seen that."" Tulip bristled and indignantly informed him that she had most certainly not appreciated the experience and it hadn't better happen again – or else! Pippin snorted. ""Or else what?"" He rolled his eyes. That sounded so like something his mother would say. ""Honestly Tulip, you're getting more like Mum every day. And no, there's nothing wrong with that…I suppose,"" he added softly. Thunder, but Tulip could chatter when she was upset! He set the basket on the floor inside the door and went into the pantry. Pearl was retrieving bread, butter, and jam for the family's luncheon. ""Pippin! Where have you been all morning? I was looking for you earlier."" Pearl continued with her work while she talked. Pippin took Tulip out of his shirt and perched her on his shoulder. ""I think I've been just about everywhere. And I'm still trying to solve the mystery of Tulip's journey."" Pearl did stop then, and turned. Her little brother was regarding her with arms folded across his chest, his little jaw set firmly, green eyes beaming. She smiled at his determined pose. He reminded her of a very small replica of their father! ""What else do you need to know?"" ""How Tulip got the rest of the way back to the hearth where I left her."" ""I found her on the egg basket, Pip. And I put her on the sideboard."" ""Oh! But, where did she go after that?"" Pearl shook her head. ""I'm afraid I don't know. Perhaps Vinca does, seeing how Tulip is wearing one of her doll's frocks?"" ""Hmph, I'm going to go find her. Thanks Pearl!"" Pippin trotted off again. ""I just saw her outside on the swing a few minutes ago,"" Pearl called after him. Pippin rushed into the grassy area where he and Tulip spent a great deal of their time playing on the swing and climbing the oak tree. Instead of Vinca he spied Hamish Hornblower on the swing. The little lad jumped off the swing, looking guilty. ""It's all right if you play on my swing, Hammie,"" called Pippin. ""Thanks! Vinca said I could, too."" ""Where is she? I've been trying to find her."" Pippin spun in a circle. Hammie shrugged. Spying the piglet under Pippin's arm he grinned. ""Ah, I see you found Tulip. I was trying to bring her to you when Pansy chased me and bit me on the bum! I dropped her and Pansy snatched her up. I'm sorry, I don't know what happened to her after that."" ""Pansy had hold of Tulip?"" Pippin squeaked in dismay, darting a look of panic at her. Tulip raised her brow and watched him knowingly. Pippin figured she was trying to make him feel guilty for all her suffering. Pansy? Oh dear! ""Ohhhh, poor wee Tulip! I'm so sorry, m'lass."" He hugged her close. Tulip sniffed and reassured him she was fine, no thanks to his carelessness, though. ""I took Tulip away from Dizzy before that. He was running around with her and I thought he might chew her up."" Pippin felt a shudder run through his entire body at the same time an identical one shivered through Tulip. He eyed her in sympathy. Oh dear! This story was getting worse by the minute now. ""I'm going to find Vinca."" Pippin left Hammie with his mouth hanging open. He found his sister at last. She squealed when she saw him with Tulip. ""Oh! There's my dolly's frock! I wondered why Tulip ran off with it."" Pervinca was just coming out of her room as her brother appeared in the doorway. Pippin scowled at her. ""You dressed Tulip in a frilly frock! How come? And why was she playing with you?"" Pervinca tossed her hair. ""I found her under my bed. She was covered in cat hair so I gave her a bath and then invited her to tea. You should thank me, not yell at me, Peregrin."" Vinca folded her arms and gave him a haughty stare. ""So, Lily had hold of her too? What in thunder is going on today?"" ""Pippin! You shouldn't use that kind of language, you're too young."" Pippin rolled his eyes, disgusted. He turned his back on his sister and dashed towards the kitchen. He and Tulip both needed some reassurance from his mother, and perhaps a hot cup of tea and a few ginger biscuits might help settle their nerves! Eglantine smiled at her lad and his wee piglet. Gently, she brushed the hair from his forehead and planted a soft kiss there, before making sure the covers were tucked in around the slumbering pair of friends. It was truly amazing the way her small son had been taken by such a simple little gift as his knitted piglet. She kissed the tip of her finger and placed it tenderly on Tulip's head. ""Keep both eyes on him lass, always,"" she whispered. ""He needs watching over."" Eglantine sighed in content as she pulled the door shut, leaving it cracked open slightly. She was thankful their adventure had ended happily for both, unable to imagine Pippin without his little friend who had taken hold of his heart so firmly."

It was mostly worn smooth, but some of the raised areas were still discernible. Merry peered at Pippin as the youngster toyed with the coin. ""What is it about the stories that make you so uncomfortable? Have you experienced something?"" Pippin squirmed under his cousin's close scrutiny. ""Of course not. I told you, it's a tale, that's all, like the faerie legend. A story the family enjoys telling at gatherings like this one. There's nothing to it."" ""You seem awfully adamant about that."" ""Because I know I'm right."" Merry gazed at his young cousin with an strange expression and Esmeralda was certain her son had discovered something he hadn't known about his little cousin, but it was something she had realised all along. The odd way Pippin seemed to know things, take them for granted, even, without thinking twice. Pippin had the gift of Sight just like his father. Like she herself. But he didn't understand it yet. In fact, it appeared he was having a fair amount of difficulty with the notion. Perhaps that was why he had such a hard time being around Aunt Pringle? Esmie watched knowingly as her Merry filed this awareness away for safekeeping. It would no doubt be an interesting conversation for the cousins one day. She smiled, not for the first time, amused by their conversation. She hadn't meant to eavesdrop; but when she heard the topic of their discussion she simply couldn't help herself. The door to the barn creaked and more sunlight spilled in. Esmie twisted around in surprise as two of the lasses poked their heads in, scanning the area. Pimpernel grinned when she spotted her aunt. Esmie winked at her conspiratorially and gestured them closer. She pointed at Pippin and Merry atop the hay mound deep in conversation. ""I feel guilty for listening in, but I happened upon them having a rather serious sounding chat and I didn't want to interrupt,"" she whispered. ""And now I'm in somewhat of a fix!"" Pervinca giggled. ""I can remedy that."" She hopped out into view and called to them in a loud voice, ""Pippin, Merry come quick! Auntie Pringle has fallen into the pond!"" ""What? Oh mercy, is she all right?"" Esmeralda pressed a hand to her mouth. The boys tumbled down from their perch with the same exclamation and sprinted for the door. Merry tossed a curious look in his mother's direction, but Esmeralda only smiled. Pimpernel held the big door open. ""Oh, she's quite all right. It seems she was pursuing some ducklings that started some gossip about her and she wanted to set them straight. I need to run inside for some towels."" She shooed the youngsters out of the barn. ""Go on now and help reassure her that nothing those ducklings might say could change the way we feel about her!"" Esmeralda hoisted up her skirts and dashed after the children. They reached the pond to find Auntie Pringle sprawled on the grass next to the water, clutching at her sides as she giggled helplessly at the spectators. She was batting Eglantine's hands away as the frustrated hobbit tried to get her to keep the shawl on. A little audience stood about somewhat at a loss for words and it was all Esmie could do to keep from rolling her eyes. This was so like Auntie to turn what others thought was a grim situation into something humorous. Some of the people were gaping at her in obvious surprise and a couple others turned away with a polite mutter. The children giggled right along with her, which only added to her mirth. Garnet and Opal appeared suitably scandalized by Pringle's frolics and were whispering about their feelings amongst a cluster of the eldest hobbits. Saradoc coughed into his hand to hide his amusement but Paladin didn't hesitate to roll his eyes and shake his head. Esmie scurried over and knelt beside Eglantine. ""Aunt Pringle! Are you all right? Are you hurt?"" ""I am quite drenched, dear, that's what I am,"" she declared before bursting into laughter once more. ""Oh! those wicked ducklings, whatever shall I do with them? This isn't the first time they've pulled their tricks on me, don't you know!"" Pippin stood back from everyone, Merry at his side. His mouth hung open forming a perfect 'O'. He stole a glance at his cousin and seeing Merry's huge grin, Pippin relaxed and shrugged his shoulders. He began to smile too. Pimpernel nudged them both out of the way as she rushed between them, spilling towels out of her arms as she ran by. Esmeralda watched the sleeping forms of her son and nephew for several moments before pulling the door to Pippin's room shut once more. With a shake of her head she proceeded to the kitchen where Eglantine was taking the pot of tea off the stove. Esmie slid into a chair with a sigh. ""Everyone is tucked in at last. I think Auntie will have a good night's sleep. After all her frolicking today she must be exhausted."" ""That's good."" Eglantine joined her. ""It certainly was a lovely party."" ""Yes indeed."" Esmeralda was quiet for a moment, thinking. ""Tina? Do you think many folk realise Auntie is nowhere near as dotty as she makes herself out to be?"" Eglantine paused in stirring the sugar into her tea. She wrinkled her brow. ""I'm not sure. Nobody says all that much. I think after her accident everyone was just so relieved she was going to be all right they overlook her eccentricities even more easily than they did before. Why do you ask?"" ""No reason in particular."" Esmeralda murmured. She gazed out the kitchen window, noting the silver orb rising in the night sky. She adored a full moon on a summer's evening. 'Twas all the better to think by. And she would keep her thoughts to herself until some other day."

The muffled voice sounded satisfied. ""I didn't think it was funny, Merry. Pippin had frightened me out of my wits. As the eldest I was supposed to be the most responsible. Aunt Eglantine would have had my head if something had happened to him."" ""I suppose so."" Merry looked around at the attentive listeners. ""We searched high and low for him and Folco helped us. We even enlisted Sam and the Gaffer. As the day wore on we became increasingly dismayed. Bilbo returned and found out what had happened and we knew we were in for a real scolding later, but we still had to locate Pippin."" ""You were very good at causing havoc and mayhem even then, weren't you little one?"" Boromir patted the blanket affectionately. ""Hmphh!"" Boromir chuckled. He could see the scowl in his mind's eye. ""And where did you find him Frodo?"" Gandalf's eyes were twinkling. He had heard this tale before. ""Well, we continued our search for another hour or so after Bilbo arrived. Finally we decided to head further out because we had looked everywhere closer to home. As we wandered into a wooded area across the meadow we began hearing a high pitched keening wail."" Frodo shrugged and glanced about with a grin. ""Of course, we knew that wail very well--"" ""I do not wail!"" Pippin flipped the blanket off his head and glared at his cousins. Frodo sniffed. ""You most certainly do. Particularly when you are in some kind of trouble."" ""We approached one of the great trees and looked up. Sure enough, there was Pippin, trapped in the highest branches of the tree."" ""But, Pip is so good at climbing trees!"" Boromir rubbed his hand over his face. ""I suppose getting down was harder at that age though."" ""Aye! Especially when you're hung up by your braces!"" Merry collapsed in laughter that was joined in by all except Pippin. ""There he was, the little rascal, all hung up in the tree and his braces the only barrier to him getting down on his own! Actually, he was swaying around a bit, his feet not even firmly on the branch below him. It's a very good thing his braces held tight or he could have fallen."" Frodo's expression sobered. ""It really was quite a fright for all of us. And it took a coordinated effort to get him down but we finally managed."" ""You looked so ridiculous Pip! Trying to teach us a lesson when you're the one who ended up learning one. Besides, it was a very dangerous thing to do and you disobeyed us."" ""Hmph, I seem to recall that I was not the only one who learned a lesson, Merry!"" ""Quite true. But you were the one everyone wanted to have a turn at paddling!"" ""Bilbo was beside himself, just as I was. He couldn't imagine having to explain to Pippin's parents that their youngest had not been watched over closely enough and had fallen out of a tree."" Frodo chuckled and squeezed Pippin's shoulder. ""It took all of his self-control to keep from spanking your deserving little behind, but in the end he decided to leave that to your folks and instead sent you to bed without supper."" Frodo laid his arm about Pippin's shoulders and his cousin grinned up at him. ""Being sent to bed without supper is even worse! I remember crying myself to sleep that night."" ""You did. And the rest of us had to suffer for your punishment by listening to you wail."" Frodo laughed again. We couldn't even enjoy our own meal, we felt so sorry for you."" ""Good then. Served you right!"" ""Oh, but we made the sacrifice Pip, for the sake of you learning a valuable lesson."" ""How very thoughtful of you, Merry."" ""Are you dry yet Pip?"" Frodo rose and checked the clothing laid out on the rocks near the fire ""Yes, it would seem these are quite ready for you to redress yourself. Go on then before you catch your death in this dampness and cold."" Pippin stood reluctantly and gathered his things, pulling on his shirt and britches as the others set about tending to their tasks. There was much to do before they bedded down again for some rest before the nightfall and the start of another long trek in the darkness. ""I believe I will go check on Bill once more."" Aragorn rose from his seat on the large rock just inside the cave's entrance. ""He was looking much better this morning and I think he will be ready to travel by tonight."" Pippin appeared thoughtful as he finished dressing. ""You know, this reminds me of another interesting story involving the three of you,"" he pointed at his cousins and Sam, ""in which I was the one responsible for the outcome being a happy one. Of course, it did include the necessity of telling on you, but at least you came out of it safely, though a bit humiliated…"" Three groans erupted simultaneously. ""Pippin! Don't you dare!"" Frodo admonished him. Pippin's huge grin and twinkling eyes ""Let's see now. A boat, a lass, some missing clothing--"" Pippin turned and ran, laughing loudly as three embarrassed hobbits took off in hot pursuit. Pippin shouted over his shoulder as he ran, ""You couldn't figure out who stole your clothes when you were swimming! That lass sure got an eyeful, didn't she?"" Pippin sprinted faster, barely managing to reach a tree and start climbing it as the others pursued him. ""Wait until I get my hands on you! You've told enough stories involving me, Pip!"" Merry was scrambling up the tree after his cousin, closely followed by Frodo and Sam as Pippin climbed higher. Gandalf and Boromir watched the commotion with interest. ""I believe that is one story I really must hear, Gandalf."" Boromir grinned at the wizard. ""Indeed."" END"

Pippin dropped the hammer and rushed to his wife's side, catching her as she wavered dizzily and easing her to the floor. Diamond wailed, ""My baby cannot be born in a cellar! Do something Pippin!"" Pippin looked about wildly then pounded on the door with both fists, yelling at the top of his lungs. As Diamond's groans became louder, Pippin grew more frantic looking for a way out. As a last resort, he kicked the door. The only result was a wail that rivaled his wife's cries and the realisation he had most likely broken a toe. Despite his efforts, the door would not budge. ""Pippin! Ahh!"" Pippin started to roll up his sleeves, glancing about the dim space. Spying several bags of flour lined up next to the door of the larder, he limped in that direction. Feeling around in his pocket for his knife he drew it out and severed the string holding one of the sacks closed. He quickly inspected it, deciding it would have to do. ""Now if only I could get my hands on a kettle of hot water, but I suppose that will have to wait,"" he mumbled under his breath. ""What are you doing? And what are you muttering about?"" Diamond demanded before she doubled over again. The pains were obviously coming harder and faster and Pippin thought he'd never seen her more frightened. ""Preparing to deliver my baby."" Pippin sounded like he meant business, and in spite of her pain, Diamond was taken aback. She stared at the firm set of his jaw. Despite all their good-natured jesting, she knew he only had her best interest at heart. But – her husband attending the birth of their child instead of the midwife? She opened her mouth to protest but another wave of pain overwhelmed her and she whimpered. Pippin forced himself to remain calm. ""Everything will be all right, my love. I'm going to take care of you."" Pippin sank onto one knee and touched her shoulder tenderly. ""But this isn't the way it's supposed to happen! Get me out of here! Please, Pippin!"" Her objections ended on a long sob. Pippin winced. Could he do this? He really had little choice unless someone noticed they'd gone missing, and soon. ""Shh, my love. I've helped with plenty of birthing on the farm. This certainly can't be much different-"" ""What? Peregrin Took! I am not giving birth to a, a, a. . .a calf! Or, or. . .or a goat! Or. . .even a wee lamb!"" Diamond paused to pant heavily. "" When she caught her breath again she continued her rant, ""This is a child! Our child! And, and I, I. . ."" Her objections were interrupted by another labour pain and she twisted Pippin's arm until both howled. *** ""What on earth was that?"" Sapphire nearly dropped her tray load of teacups as she abruptly halted beside the kitchen door. Eglantine bumped into her back, saucers and plates crashing to the ground. Shards of glass sprayed in every direction, but both were oblivious as they strained their ears. The sound came again, a muffled cry. Eglantine grasped her friend's arm, eyes wide. ""Why, it sounded like-"" ""What's the matter, Mum?"" Sancho was close behind with more of the dirty dishes. Sapphire plopped her tray on a table and dashed to the cellar door. She tugged frantically on the handle but nothing happened. Sancho intervened, grasping the latch and jiggling it with a long practiced hand. ""You know it always sticks. Has for years."" He yanked the door open. Squinting into the dim light they gaped at the sight. Diamond Took had her newborn infant gathered in her shawl, cradled to her breast, while Pippin tended to her quietly. Sancho overcame his surprise swiftly and grinned openly at his friend. ""Heavens, you just had to be the centre of attention, even on my wedding day, Pip? I see you found the strawberry jam, though."" ""Oh! Oh, mercy!"" Eglantine elbowed Sancho out of the way and dashed in. ""Oh, hush, Sancho,"" Sapphire admonished, hurrying down the steps to assist Eglantine with Diamond. ""Whatever happened, my dear? Are you all right?"" Diamond smiled up into her husband's face. Pippin's eyes twinkled with pride and relief. ""I'm fine. Thank goodness Pippin was with me. I don't think I could have done this without him at my side."" *** ""What are you giggling about, my dear?"" Eglantine gave a start. ""Why, I thought you were sound asleep, Pad."" Her husband smiled and gave a slight shake of his head. ""Almost, but not quite."" He rose and stood at her side, gazing down into the newborn's face with a look that seemed to Eglantine to be one of awe. ""I can't take my eyes off him."" Eglantine nodded and planted a gentle kiss on the tiny forehead. The infant stirred. ""I'd better get young Faramir Took back to his mother. He'll be getting hungry again soon."" Paladin took his grandchild from her, cradling him close. ""Who'd have thought, Tina? Our lad, all grown up with a lad of his own. I'm glad I've lived long enough to see this day."" ""I need to get used to that odd name. I never dreamed they would name him that."" ""It's different, all right. This child's namesake must be an extraordinary man indeed, for our son to make such a break with tradition."" Paladin smiled, using his thumb to stroke one soft cheek. A tiny fist shot into the air and waved about. Faramir opened his mouth and let loose a hearty wail. Paladin chuckled and winked at his wife. ""He wants to be fed. I can absolutely see his likeness to our Pippin!"" Eglantine laughed until she needed to dab at her eyes with one corner of her apron. It felt good. The day had been outlandish; it's ending, a new beginning. Published 25 January, 2010"
257,2,18,2-CEShaughnessy-18.txt,lord-of-the-rings,CEShaughnessy,"""Whatever is wrong Pip?"" Pearl was the first to rush in at the sound of her little brother's cries. Close behind her was Merry, a concerned look turning to one of surprise when he heard what the problem was. ""Where did you last see her?"" Merry glanced around the big room, poking behind some of the cushions on the couch and peeking behind it. Pippin was sobbing again as he tried to answer. ""She was in bed underneath the quilt in between me and Merry. That's where she likes to sleep all night because it's nice and warm. I got up to go to the privy and when I came back she was gone!"" ""Pippin,"" Pearl placed a comforting arm around his shoulders and knelt in front of him. ""Are you certain that's where you put her when you went to bed? Or perhaps you thought she was tucked in snuggly but she fell out from under the covers. I know that's happened before. Did you look under your bed?"" ""Of course I did!"" Pippin sounded insulted. ""That's the first place I looked because I thought she was playing a game with me, trying to fool me, or maybe she wanted to play hide and seek. But she wasn't there."" Pippin began wailing again and Pearl scooped him up in her arms. ""He did it! Sancho took Tulip, I know he did!"" Pippin pointed as the other boy came around the corner. Sancho stopped, mouth dropping open, eyes widening in apparent surprise. ""What? What are you talking about?"" ""Mercy, we could hear you all the way from the kitchen, Peregrin. What happened?"" Eglantine was next to enter the room and looked around in confusion as the two youngsters glared at one another. Pippin struggled to get out of his sister's arms and Pearl set him down. ""You took Tulip – give her back right now!"" Pippin advanced on the bigger boy, finger poised to poke Sancho in the chest, his face turning red with fury. ""Whoa, hold on there a moment, lad,"" Eglantine caught hold of her son's arm as he stormed past and swung him easily around to face her. ""Now, just what is this all about?"" ""I didn't take your stupid piggy!"" ""Yes you did! You were threatening her yesterday, and teasing me and calling Tulip names and, and, and--"" ""Slow down, young hobbit,"" Eglantine said, giving her son a slight shake, ""and catch your breath."" She looked from one youngster to the other. ""Now, I want to know what happened."" Both boys started to babble at once and their voices rose until she was forced to place her hands over both ears. ""Stop! Enough."" Sapphire pulled her son close and knelt on one knee, looking him in the eye. ""Sancho, are you responsible for Pippin's missing toy?"" ""NO! I already told him I didn't take it!"" Sapphire laid a finger across her son's lips. ""Shh, now! Do not shout at me, young sir."" ""He did so take Tulip, I know he did!"" Pippin lunged at Sancho and was hauled back smartly. ""I did NOT!"" ""YES YOU DID!"" ""Peregrin, stop that shouting this instant,"" Eglantine scolded. ""And the same goes for you, young hobbit,"" Sapphire told her son. ""Give Pippin back his toy."" ""I didn't take it, Mum!"" ""Well, who else would? You don't like her and you hid her away from me just to be mean!"" Pippin struggled in his mother's arms, earning himself a sharp swat to his backside. ""Oww! What'd you do that for?"" ""Oh my, you need to settle down right now, Peregrin Took! This is becoming ridiculous,"" Eglantine scolded. Sapphire sighed as she brushed the hair from her eyes and pointed at her son. ""I said to give Pippin his toy, Sancho."" Her voice had grown sharp. ""But I didn't take it!"" he protested, and stamped his foot for emphasis. Sapphire pointed again, her face stern. ""Then you will go to your room and think long and hard about this and you shan't come out until you're ready to tell the truth."" Looking like he was about to burst into tears, Sancho tore out of the room leaving his mother, Eglantine, and Esmeralda staring after him in dismay. Pippin continued to wail. ""I have to find her, Mum!"" He tugged frantically on his mother's apron. ""You'll help me, won't you?"" ""We'll lend a hand too, Pip,"" Merry reassured his little cousin, glaring in the direction Sancho had gone. ""Come on, we'll get the other lads to help us and we'll organize a search party,"" Merry soothed as he drew him along. ""Thank you, m'lad,"" Esmeralda called after them. ""Well, I'm going to start the search in Sancho's room,"" Sapphire said. ""And while I'm there I'm going to have a little talk with him. If he did take Pippin's toy, I'll bring it back to him shortly."" She laid a hand on Eglantine's arm. ""Tina, Esmie, I'm sorry for all this commotion my son has caused."" ""It's all right, Sapphy,"" Eglantine reassured her. ""Children will be children, after all. Maybe your lad is telling the truth and he didn't take Tulip."" Eglantine turned back to Esmeralda when they were alone. ""Och, and I'm afraid my lad won't be any less than beside his wee self until he finds his knitted friend. Do you think Sancho took Tulip, Esmie? Perhaps he wants a stuffed toy of his own? I noticed he was the only one of the children who didn't have one."" Esmeralda pondered. ""I don't know,"" she answered slowly. ""If he did, surely he'd realise he'd be the first one Pippin would accuse, given the way he's been teasing him about Tulip."" ""Hmm, well it's a mystery and that's for sure, Esmie. I'd best be joining the search myself, that is if I want to be having any peace of mind a'tall the rest of the day."" ""Aye, and isn't that the truth? I'll come with you."" Esmeralda followed, her brow wrinkled in thought."

Pippin leaned forward and eagerly lifted the tea towel that covered the basket. ""Yes, your mother both packed it full of goodies for us. Wasn't that thoughtful of her?"" Frodo watched with amusement as Pippin rifled through the contents, plucking out an apple tart and popping it into his mouth with one hand, while plunging the other back inside for more. Frodo swatted his hand away. ""Those are for afters."" ""Yes, Pip, keep your grubby little paws out of our food. You haven't even washed your hands yet,"" Merry pretended to be stern, and Pippin stuck his tongue out. ""You sound like Mum."" He thought for a moment before adding, ""and Tulip."" ""Merry's right."" Frodo caught Pippin's waving hands up in his own. ""Look at how dirty they are. Come, let's all go have a wash before we eat."" ""You'll not get any argument from me."" Merry rose and tugged Pippin along. ""It's been two hours since first breakfast."" After washing their hands at the riverbank, the threesome sat back to enjoy their picnic luncheon. Frodo spread the cloth on the grass and laid out the food, which amounted to a veritable feast. In addition to the apple tarts, there were cherry and strawberry-rhubarb ones. Thick sandwiches of leftover chicken from supper the night before were added to the makeshift tablecloth, along with wedges of cheese, slices of ham, and a container filled with sweet tea, plus some carrot sticks and a few apples to 'fill up the corners.' It looked like Eglantine had thought of everything. The trio enjoyed their food and one another's company for the next hour, gazing out at the slowly moving river and watching a small family of ducklings swimming after their mother near the riverbank. Tulip rested on the grass, occasionally reminding Pippin to share his sweets with her. ""That was wonderful,"" Pippin sighed finally, slumping against Frodo's side and releasing a loud belch. ""Excuse you!"" Frodo chuckled and nudged the youngster in the ribs. ""Where are your manners?"" ""I think he left them back at the barn,"" Merry said, stretching out on the grass to relax. ""Let's have a short nap before we go fishing."" ""Good idea,"" Pippin murmured, already nodding off. Frodo watched them with a fond smile and then settled in to do the same. ""I did promise to bring back some fish for dinner, though."" ""We'll help you,"" Merry assured him and soon he was snoring. A few hours later they headed back, each of them carrying a string of catfish. Merry began humming a limerick under his breath and Frodo raised an eyebrow when he recognised it. ""There once was a hobbit from Bree, whose mem…what?"" Merry looked up innocently at the sharp poke in the ribs. ""I believe our cousin is a little young to hear that one just yet,"" Frodo nodded at Pippin. ""What? No I'm not! Merry, tell me the rest! Everyone always says I'm too young!"" ""Umm, never mind."" Merry choked back his laughter at Pippin's indignation. ""Frodo's right. You are too young."" Pippin sighed in disgust and bent to retrieve a stone to fling. ""Tulip says you did that on purpose, Merry."" ""Who, me?"" Merry was grinning ear to ear. ""I think he did too, Pip,"" Frodo leaned down and spoke in a loud whisper. ""Hmph. That was nothing. How about this one? There once was a…oww!"" Merry batted at Frodo after his older cousin's light cuff to the back of his head. Pippin giggled. ""I guess you're too young too!"" ""I am not."" ""Yes you are,"" Frodo nodded. ""Particularly when you keep doing it after being told to stop."" Merry rolled his eyes. ""Hurry up. We need to get these fish home."" He sprinted off ahead of them, waving at them to follow. ""I think Merry's upset with you for hushing him up,"" Pippin said. ""He'll get over it,"" Frodo said with a shrug of his shoulder. ""Cousin Bilbo!"" Pippin brightened when he spied the old hobbit standing outside the pony stable drawing on his pipe, and sprinted towards him. ""Ah, m'lad, how are you? My, how you've grown since our last visit."" Bilbo gathered the youth in his arms and squeezed as Pippin immediately started to babble about their morning. ""Yes, yes indeed, it sounds like you all had a marvelous time."" Bilbo pointed over Pippin's shoulder. ""Now, you'd best get those fish inside, eh?"" Pippin nodded vigourously. ""Come on Pip, we'll do it together,"" Frodo smiled down at the curly, disheveled head of curls. ""Because we have another surprise to tell you about, don't we Merry?"" ""Another surprise? What? What is it?"" Pippin jumped up and down causing his string of fish to swing back and forth. Frodo nodded at Merry to tell him. ""You're coming with us tomorrow to spend a week at Bag End!"" ""What? I am?"" ""Everyone is coming, Pip,"" Frodo said. ""To attend the Faire. Your parents and sisters--"" ""Tulip too!"" ""Of course, Tulip too."" Frodo smiled. ""Umm, couldn't we just leave Vinca here? She's always teasing me."" ""No, Pip, we can't leave your sister behind,"" Frodo told him as he opened the door. ""Not just this once?"" ""Not even just this once."" Frodo nudged the youngster through the door after Merry, with Pippin still chattering up a storm. ""Can I take Lily?"" ""I don't know, Pip,"" Frodo took Pippin's string of fish from him as they entered the big kitchen. ""How about Dizzy?"" ""Probably not."" Frodo handed the strings of fish to Eglantine. ""Can Tulip bring her new apron?"" ""Huh?"" Merry looked at his aunt for an explanation. ""His knitted piggy has an apron now?"" ""Why not? She has a scarf,"" Pippin giggled, ""and a bonnet."" ""Ah, it's a long story, lad."" Eglantine patted her nephew's back. ""Pippin will tell you all about it on the way to Hobbiton tomorrow."" ""I can't wait,"" Merry mumbled."
259,2,9,2-CEShaughnessy-9.txt,lord-of-the-rings,CEShaughnessy,"""I can't believe you would stoop so low, Pip. And you did it simply because you were unhappy with me? I don't know if I can ever forgive you."" ""Merry,"" Frodo cautioned with a stern look. ""I said I was sorry!"" Pippin released a loud sob and ran from the room. Paladin started to go after him. Frodo stopped him with a hand on his arm. ""Pad, may I talk to him?"" Paladin nodded. Frodo hurried away as Paladin turned to his nephew and Estella. ""I spoke with him at length. He really is full of remorse for what he did. And you've been told the full story. I hope you'll find it within yourselves to make amends with him."" Merry sighed heavily while Estella dabbed at her eyes with a handkerchief. ""Leave it for the morrow, anyway. When you're ready you can go and talk to him in his room. That's where he'll be spending the day as punishment for his misbehavior."" Frodo found Pippin face down on his bed crying into his pillow. His heart ached for his cousin. He sat beside him on the edge of the bed and laid a gentle hand on Pippin's shoulder. ""It will get better. I promise,"" he said very softly. ""What?"" Pippin lifted a tear-streaked face to look at him and then plunged it back into the pillow. ""No it won't."" ""Yes. It will. I should know."" Pippin sat up and threw himself into his cousin's arms and sobbed uncontrollably for a time. Frodo held him and allowed the tears to do the work of cleansing his guilty conscience. ""Merry hates me! I know he does."" ""No he doesn't, and I think you know that. It's just that right now he's very upset. Two of the people he cares for most in the whole world are hurting."" Pippin shook his head against Frodo's chest. ""He'll never forgive me. Neither will Estella. I never meant for the prank to go so wrong! Honestly I didn't!"" ""I know. And when Merry calms down he'll see that too. So will Estella. Why, someday we'll all look back on this and laugh."" Frodo chuckled at Pippin's snort of disbelief and encircled his little cousin even tighter. ""You'll see."" br/ /p It was time for the Yule celebration to begin with the lighting of the Yule log in the great fireplace. The musicians were warming up and Pippin joined them carrying his fiddle. He was very pleased to be asked to join them. As he tuned up, his eyes flitted around the huge room and he spied Merry, who was helping with the fire. He smiled ever so slightly. The last several days had certainly not been painless ones. The long talk he and Merry had was not easy either. But gradually they had been able to talk. Pippin smiled. Really talk. About many things they hadn't shared before. It had been a huge relief to clear up all the misunderstandings between them. Both of them had come to a new appreciation for what the other was going through. The talk with Estella had been even more difficult. Pippin recalled how ashamed he was for his irresponsible actions, and worse, having to face Estella and explain to her why he had done it. But strangely, in the end she had seemed to be aware of what had motivated his behavior. She even forgave him. Pippin had been stunned by the apology she'd offered him. He watched his cousin fondly now as he and Estella joined everyone in the first dance of the evening. Pippin smiled as he played his fiddle, and wished Marigold was here. After playing for the first few dances he approached the refreshment table during a break and was surprised when Estella and Merry moved toward him. He tensed for the briefest of moments, and then breathed easily when they both smiled at him. ""Peregrin, would you care to have the next dance with me?"" Pippin's eyes widened at Estella's invitation. He looked at Merry, who nodded his approval and patted him on the back. He followed her onto the dance floor, feeling all eyes upon them, and as awkward as a newborn lamb. As the music swelled he began to relax and the familiar steps of the slow dance came back to him easily. Many thoughts ran through his mind as they moved to the sound of the fiddles and other instruments. He hummed along to the music as he reminisced, remembering some of Frodo's words to him last night. His cousin's soft tone and the gentle, almost poetic cadence of his voice had comforted him greatly. Perhaps Frodo was right. There were definitely some complicated paths in front of him. But if he never took the chance to learn about something new, even though it was scary, how would he ever learn to cope? No, he was stronger than that. Of this he was certain. The dreams were worrisome and he knew they meant something, although he didn't know what, as of yet. Becoming a teen was daunting at times, along with all those weird and wonderful new ways of thinking, and the odd sensations as he felt his body changing. He still experienced a twinge or two of regret whenever it was clear that Merry preferred to spend his time with Estella, as opposed to him. But at least now he better understood where all his strange, conflicting feelings about it were coming from. Frodo was right, yes. Life was indeed a dance of mystery and involved taking chances. It sometimes even left him breathless with wonder. He decided then and there he would never let his fear consume him like it had, not ever again. Frodo had assured him that when a particular door in his life closed, it simply meant that another had opened, and it was time for him to try something new. He would not sit out the joys, or the perils. Instead, he would dance."

""The best one's always do, son."" I nodded, bringing the bottle to my mouth again before speaking. ""I was right, the leak was in Garrett's crew, he had no clue who it was, but with the right incentives he was easily found and dealt with."" I waved the bottle around. ""Fucker was a low level gofer, pissed that he hadn't ranked up. He thought he'd chance it with the feds, apparently they were investigating him for a robbery. He made a deal and the rest is history."" I leaned back and grabbed a smoke, lighting it up and taking a deep pull. ""Where is he now?"" My father asked. ""Buried in the desert,"" I laughed. ""You should have heard the rat bastard cry when I removed his tongue, music to my ears."" I grinned at him and he shook his head. ""Sometimes your thirst for blood scares me son."" I nodded. I knew that, but I am what I am. Just as I opened my mouth to speak, he cursed, looking behind me. I turned to see what had his attention and saw red. Some fucker was was grabbing at my Crimson. She was shaking her head, trying to move away, but was stuck between the wall and the dead motherfucker. I was up out of my seat in a flash, I didn't hear or see anything, I had tunnel vision on the fucker. I punched him, knocking him to the floor, but before he had a chance to get a word out my foot made contact with his body. ""She's mine, you slack-assed, motherfucker."" I kicked him in the head. ""Bitch-ass, punk thinks he can touch what's mine."" Another kick and I heard him groan from the pain. Hands grabbed me, pulling me away, the red haze lifting. I saw Crimson stood still against the wall. I broke free from whoever was holding me back and held my hand out towards her. ""Come on baby."" She grabbed my hand and I dragged her back to my office. Once inside I pulled her to me ripping her blouse open. ""You're mine Crimson, say it, tell me you're mine. Tell me who owns you."" I demanded while working my mouth down her chest sucking and biting along the way. ""I'm yours Clover, just yours."" She moaned and pulled at my hair. ""I have to have you, I have to show you. YOU ARE MINE!"" I spun her around, bending her over the pool table. ""Tell me you want me, tell me I can baby."" I kissed up her back, taking her ponytail into my hand, wrapping it around my fist. I pulled her head back and looked at her. ""You know you're safe, don't you Crimson?"" I leaned forward so I could see her eyes, my lips at her temple, there was no fear in them, all I could see was lust. She nodded and moaned. ""Do it Clover, make me yours."" ""Undo your jeans, baby."" She did as I asked and I pushed them down to her knees, forcing her legs apart I used my free hand to pull my dick free from my jeans. Keeping my hand wrapped around her hair I entered her in one fast thrust. She yelped and moaned as I pounded into her, fast and steady, not giving her time to adjust. ""Mine baby, you're mine. Mine to touch, mine to taste, mine to fuck."" I growled at her, my hand tugging at her hair. ""Yes,"" she groaned. ""Shhh… don't talk, just feel, feel my cock claiming you."" The anger from earlier was slowly leaving my body as the pleasure took over. ""Mine, mine, mine, mine, mine."" I chanted with each thrust. She moaned and panted as I thrust deep and hard, I pulled her hair, bringing her head back so I could gain better access to her neck, the action made her back arch more and I slid even deeper inside her. ""I'm going to come, come for me baby."" She moaned and I felt her squeeze me, my free hand reached around and rubbed at her clit sending her over the edge quickly, with me following right behind her. I lay over her back, panting for breath. Crimson had her head on the table while I was draped over her, her body slick with sweat. I pulled out and turned her around, pulling her jeans off, I massaged her legs and arms kissing every inch I could reach. I looked at her face and smiled at the huge fucking grin she was sporting. She looked cute as fuck, her hair stuck to the side of her head with sweat. ""You okay Crimson, baby?"" she nodded and blew out a deep breath. ""Yeah, I'm good,"" she laughed. ""So fucking good."" Her arms stretched over her head and came down to rest over my shoulders, she kissed me softly and looked into my eyes. ""I just have one question Clover?"" She raised her eyebrow at me. ""Shoot baby."" I'd answer anything she asked. ""You know you're mine too, right?"" I laughed and nodded. ""Too right I'm yours baby. Crimson and Clover."" I kissed her again. I couldn't wait to see what life had in store for us. There were things we still needed to learn about each other, but no matter what, we would deal with it together. Crimson and clover… over and over. Hosts Note: Please leave the author some love by leaving a review.

It would seem that almost as soon as he'd finished with me, he was ready to go again. Not that I'm complaining. Then we had the week where he had to go away on business. God, that nearly killed me. I still worked late that Thursday, and I emailed him saying I had the biggest problem on the project to date, and it was a real shame he wasn't there to help me solve it. My phone rang almost instantly, and without even checking I was alone in the office, he was telling me to undo my blouse and take of my knickers. I, of course, followed his instructions to the letter. He proceeded to tell me exactly how to touch myself. I found relief with my own fingers for the first time since we'd started this thing with him whispering in my ear exactly what he'd do to me if he were there in person. I showed him my appreciation when he got back in our only other get together during office hours. I rode straight up to his office with him that Monday morning, neither of us saying a word the whole way. His PA wasn't in yet, and I followed him into his office, and after he'd kissed me stupid, I sank down onto my knees in front of him as he sat behind his desk in his big leather chair. He proceeded to fire up his laptop as I set about showing him exactly what he'd been missing. I was just taking him into my mouth fully for the first time, having teased him with licks and kisses up to that point, when there was a knock on his door. To my surprise he called out for the person to enter. I went to pull away, but his hand came to rest on the back of my head, holding me firmly in place. It was his PA, bringing him his morning coffee and his post. He spoke to her politely before requesting she go down to the sixth floor to get some report from some department. I don't remember too many details as all the while they were talking, he was gently encouraging me, with his hand on the back of my head, to continue what I was doing under the table. I was embarrassed and surprised to find that the elicit nature of doing this to a man, this man, in secret while he talked to someone else was making me feel extremely turned on. I sucked him harder, swirling my tongue over his head and bringing my hand up to fondle his balls. I was determined to make him loose control while she was there. But he didn't. I knew he was close though because, as soon as the door shut behind her, he shot his load right down my throat with muttered curses about me being the death of him. I got out of there before his PA came back from her errand to the sixth floor. An errand that he admitted was totally made up. But not before he returned the favor and made me see stars bent over his desk. But now the data had been gathered, and the evidence correlated and checked. Tomorrow, he was going to hand over the three offenders to the police, after firing their asses. He was looking forward to it. Personally, I wasn't looking forward to it. It meant the end of the project and, therefore, the end of us. We had no further need to meet up. It had been clear all along that what we were doing had to end. It was only sex after all. Great, mind-blowing sex, the best sex I'd ever had, but still only sex. There was no relationship. I'd also received a job offer from a rival firm. It was a step up the ladder and promised great things. As fantastic as fucking Mr. Cullen was, my integrity was starting to raise its annoying head. How could I have a career in a firm where I was screwing the boss? How would I ever know I'd achieved things on my own? It was going to kill me to walk away from him, but I knew things couldn't continue. In fact, I knew things weren't going to continue even if I stayed. I also knew, in the long run, I needed more than just great, mind-blowing sex. I dreamed of a man that I could spend my holidays with, of marriage and babies, and growing old in each other's embrace. All the things that were not offered by Mr. Cullen. So, as he had his meeting and handed our evidence over to the authorities, along with the three guilty parties, I made my call to McCarty Construction to let them know I'd be taking up their offer and could start the next week. I was sure with the department in disarray following the loss of three key players, no one would question me leaving so suddenly. Technically, I should give two-weeks' notice, but I knew I could get that waived. See, I was fucking the boss. Later that afternoon, I sent him an email explaining all. I said my goodbyes to Angela, who promised she'd keep in touch, packed up my personal items from my desk, and took elevator three down to the lobby before leaving CWH for the last time.

He slides his arm away and looks at me crossly. ""I detest that nickname."" ""You're stalling. How many times?"" ""Counting this time?"" ""Yes."" Several seconds pass, and I rethink the wisdom of asking. Can I really handle hearing this number? ""Once."" "" Once?"" ""Hey, I'm working as fast as I can here, but I've only been human for twenty-four hours""—he pauses briefly to let me absorb what he's saying—""but if you're ready to go again, we could double my record."" ""Wait, you've never been human before?"" ""Nope."" I pop up onto one elbow. ""You're a virgin ?"" Mace laughs so hard the bed shakes. ""Not anymore."" I can't decide if I'm more surprised, awed, or annoyed. ""You sold me this whole 'I need to show you' routine when you've never done it before?"" ""Yeah . . . there's this thing called 'research.'"" The smug smile has returned. ""Was that a porn move you just did on me?"" Mace rolls his eyes. ""Bella, I live in people's heads. Some people are quite proficient at sex, and I happen to have an excellent memory. Also, it doesn't hurt that I'm intimately familiar with every sexual fantasy you've had for the last fourteen years."" ""Ugh!"" I flop away from him onto my back and pull the pillow over my face. Mace climbs on top of me, straddling my waist. The pillow is lifted and flung away. ""I'm ready to whisper in your ear now."" I glance down to the penis resting on my belly, not hard yet, but I don't doubt his potential. ""Already?"" Mace tweaks my nipples. ""Ouch!"" ""Do you want Elizabeth to let down her guard or not?"" ""Oh! Yes !"" Head out of the gutter, Bella. This is a big moment for Elizabeth and Mace. I close my eyes for the beat it takes me to switch into character. ""Okay, I'm ready."" ""All right. So . . . I haven't been one hundred percent truthful with you."" Was that a quake in his voice? Damn, he's good. ""Oh?"" Elizabeth answers with my mouth. ""Not that I lied. I didn't lie . . . I just, maybe, omitted a little detail."" The author in me nods encouragingly. Yes, this is good. This sounds like Mace. Elizabeth answers again. ""What little detail might that be?"" ""So . . . the gods don't exactly grant exclusives to muses just so an author can finish a story. Even if it is a bestselling series."" ""Huh?"" Mace bites his lip and studies a spot on the ceiling before turning back. ""Bella."" Gulp. He's not my character talking to my other character. He's Mace, talking to me. ""What are you saying, Mace? Why did they let you come here?"" ""Because . . . I'm in love with you."" I'm not sure I have the tools to process this. We've just crossed lines and worlds and Mace loves me ! ""But you're . . . and I'm . . . can this happen ?"" He shrugs. ""It happened."" ""Has this ever happened before?"" ""Not to me,"" he answers with a rueful smile. Poor Mace; I've never seen him so insecure. Oh wait, I have. Book five. Right before Elizabeth shuts him out, and Mace turns into a giant dick. ""Why didn't you tell me this at the book store? Or in the car? Or at the restaurant? Or before we . . . did that !"" ""That would've been a dick move. I needed you to accept my offer because it was the best move for your career. And I definitely needed you to have sex with me for the right reasons."" ""Love isn't a good reason to have sex? ""I couldn't let you base your decision on my feelings."" ""So you blackmailed me instead?"" ""It killed me to have to do that to you."" His mouth twists into a terrible scowl. ""For the record, I didn't make up the part about the cover. That is how it works."" ""But why?"" ""I guess if Apollo made it too easy, all the muses would've defected by now."" I can't begin to separate all the pieces right now. My heart's in a freefall, and my head is in no position to catch it. ""I'm sorry, I have no idea what I'm supposed to say."" ""I don't know, Bella. You're the writer."" A dark chuckle leaves him, and I understand I've already hurt him. ""I am, however, starting to understand why Mace hasn't opened up to Elizabeth."" Crap . ""I'm really sorry I suck at this."" He frowns at me because now we're both sad. He does that sweet gesture he knows I love, tucking my hair behind my ear. ""Bella, there's nothing to be good at. Just say what's in your heart. It doesn't have to be Pulitzer-worthy."" He blinks too fast, staving off tears. ""Just tell me you love me back—if you do, that is."" ""Oh, Mace. Of course I love you."" The storm brewing behind his eyes clears out as quickly as it arrived, and a bright smile takes its place. Yes, Mace owns me, but I own him right back. I may not have created Mace Cullen without divine inspiration, but if the price is loving and being loved by the man of my dreams till death do us part, that is a deal I will take any day of the week.

263,4,27,4-ControlPossessSeduceContest-27.txt,twilight,ControlPossessSeduceContest,"sure. They'll kill me for this because they know I could run to my father at any time, but I'm a girl that loves to live. I can't risk being dead. And listen to me, Edward. I don't hate what you do. I hate what it makes you feel and I hate that you're stuck and don't want to be. I hate it so much, it's made me cold. Colder than you. Cold enough to do this."" ""You're a fucking lunatic."" ""Yes. Don't you find it wild?"" she asked, lifting her skirt slowly, to show my gun strapped to her pale thigh. And there I was, unstrapped and half naked. I shook my head slowly, rolling my eyes at her. So fucking predictable. So cliché, my little grasshopper. My student became the teacher as she pointed it at me and I laughed at her. She smiled and shrugged; her soft doe-eyed gaze was begging me to concede and love her. That pretty pink skirt shivered and I knew she was shaking. ""You wouldn't do it,"" I said. ""You wouldn't make me."" ""I could just take the gun away from you,"" I said. ""Probably. But people do insane things for love and Edward, I'm crazy for you. I'm answering your prayers and I'm granting your wishes here, so help me out a little,"" she said, the tip of her nose turned pink and her eyes watered. ""Please."" I did something I once swore I'd never do, I turned my back to someone I had no reason to trust. I felt her kiss on my shoulder blade at the same time the cool metal from the gun pressed into the back of my neck. It was, perhaps, the most liberating moment of my fucked life. It's extraordinary, how sometimes you gain so much the moment you give up control. ""Okay,"" she whispered and she walked me up the stairs, weapon to my neck. Upstairs, that great old building was empty aside from all of our secrets, hanging around like oppressive fog. She leaned to grab my jacket from the post where I'd slung it on the way in the night before. Just then, Emmett appeared from around the corner, across the vast room. ""Where the hell do you think you're going, Bella?"" he asked, but his eyes were on mine. ""I think it's clear I can't stay,"" she said. It was wistful and I do believe she was sad to leave him. ""No, what's clear is you can't walk out of here knowing what you know, either,"" Emmett said. She moved the gun to the side of my neck so he could see it and let out a long, slow breath. ""Jesus, Bella. Knock it off,"" he told her. ""I'm taking him. If you follow us or come after us, ever, I'm going to call my father and tell them everything I know. And I love you and I don't want to do that. So please."" Emmett gaped at her, his eyes wide before he slipped them back over to me. ""What'd you want me to do?"" he asked. ""I don't make the decisions anymore. It's yours now,"" I told him, ""Go through the desk. Do the thing, take my place—"" ""Fuck you,"" he said, but he didn't mean it. He meant "" don't leave."" ""He doesn't have a choice,"" Bella said. ""Neither do you."" God. I was sorry. I was so sorry. But he could do it. They all could. They'd all be okay or they wouldn't. I'd never know either way, which was just as well because knowing might kill me. But staying would kill me, too, because not for a second did I doubt she'd actually shoot that gun. She hates what I cannot; she hates my sadness and hate kills. Ironically, her hate was going to save me from this caged and damned life. By that time the next day, we were far away from the A and free. I had no skill, no money, no direction. But I had hope and a wide open world full of possibilities, I had clean hands for the first time in so long and I had Bella. She's too reckless and I'm too cold, she dreams and I scheme. We're some kind of dark and destined, but it's love. Not the standard love, not the love we're taught is good. But then, how can anyone attempt to define love when it's so personal, when it's so dependent on the uniqueness of life and circumstance? It was fucked, it was the type of love others warn against and deny is love at all. It wasn't patient, it wasn't kind. It was selfish and it was possessive, but it was our own, and we'd never been the type to follow the rules. We don't fit on any list of healthy and functioning but I know this: When we stab each other through the heart and double cross, when we trap and tangle the other just to keep them near; just when you think ' My God, these are sordid, despicable people' , remember that there is nothing softer or more sensitive than those who love. There's nothing we won't do for love. While this may mean the actions of a monster it doesn't for a second make us evil; we're simply more desperate than the cowards who wouldn't go to such lengths for love. Our destruction caused along the way was simply the bloody means to the angel-soft end: Always love. Hosts Note: Please leave the author some love by leaving a review.

264,4,36,4-ControlPossessSeduceContest-36.txt,twilight,ControlPossessSeduceContest,"I'm sure the faculty would love to hear about how you assaulted Bella."" ""But I didn't! We were just talking."" ""Yes, you were. I saw it all, and I stepped in to avoid it escalating into rape. Who do you think they'll believe?"" Mike stares at Edward with pure hatred written across his features. ""Fuck you, Masen."" Edward doesn't reply. ""So, what? You're fucking your teacher, Bella? Is that what it's about?"" Mike sneers at me. I turn my head and don't reply. Mike laughs, an ugly sound filled with anger. ""You won't get away with this."" He turns and leaves then, still rubbing his arm. Even though my whole being cries out for him, Edward doesn't touch me at all. I know someone may be watching, so I stay where I am instead of wrapping my arms around his body and laying my head on his chest. ""Are you okay, Bella?"" he asks, his fists clenching at his sides with the effort it takes to not touch me. I nod, tears welling in my eyes, annoying me. I hate to cry because it makes me feel like I'm weak, but Mike genuinely scared me. ""I'm fine., Edward. But Mike… He's getting worse. He just won't take no for an answer."" ""This has happened before? Why didn't you tell me?"" Full of guilt, I look up at him. ""I didn't think it was anything serious. I kept telling him no, and he kept coming back and insisting I go to prom with him. I can't tell him I'm taken. I wish I could..."" Edward steps closer to me, his warm breath teasing the tiny hairs along my forehead. I feel that tightening in the pit of my stomach as my heart does a lovely flip in my chest. ""You're mine, Bella. Maybe one day soon, we'll be able to tell everyone..."" Astonished, I stare at him. ""Edward, you're married."" ""Maybe that will change,"" he replies, his eyes intense. My heart pounds with excitement and fear as endless possibilities go through my head. His words are so simple yet dangerously loaded. He told me divorce isn't a possibility for him, as Rosalie's parents had insisted on a prenuptial agreement that stated Edward would be left penniless if he ever left her. ""I'll protect you, Bella. Tell me if that kid bothers you again."" It's not a request. I nod. We go our separate ways after that, and I'm aware Mike is watching me wherever I go as I attend all of my classes. My spine crawls with fear as he grins at me quite openly when I catch him. He doesn't look scared, just determined. . . . A few more months pass, and the flame between me and Edward has only grown. I love him with every fiber of my being, and although he's yet to say those words, I know he's utterly addicted to me, my body, and my presence in his life. Every spare moment is spent together, and we drink each other in. Sex is a massive part of our relationship, but lately, we've begun to dream about things that can't happen. On my eighteenth birthday, Edward gave me an unusual bracelet. It's gold and wraps around my arm several times. It looks to be of Aztec origin, but it could just be fake. I don't care if it is, though. I love it and wear it constantly. Mike still watches me, and that shiver of fear will always accompany his stare. It's as if my sixth sense is warning me to be careful, so I am. I avoid him at all cost. Things between Edward and Rosalie aren't good, and I can't say I'm unhappy about this. . . . It's a Tuesday night, and I'm riding Edward's cock in the back seat of his Jaguar. He unexpectedly asked me to meet him an hour ago, and I agreed. I never say no to him. There's no reason to; we both want the same thing. I felt his body harden inside me, and I rock against him as the spiral inside me shatters, sending me free falling into outer space. Edward fiercely grips me to him as he comes and his teeth mark my neck, reaffirming our bond. I hold him tighter as the pain from the bite mingles with the unadulterated bliss rippling through my body. ""Mine,"" Edward growls against my skin, and I glow with the knowledge I belong to him on a level no one else ever could. ""Yes. Yours,"" I whimper as I move with him, still restless and seeking. ""All yours."" After our bodies and hearts have calmed, we lie together on the seat. Edward's body is bent to accommodate the tiny space, and mine is lying along his effortlessly. His fingers dance along my spine as I listen to the sound of air filling and leaving his lungs. ""Bella?"" he says softly. I raise my head to look at him. ""Yes?"" He stares at me intently for a few moments, as if he's memorizing my face. ""We have to get rid of Rosalie."" ""Get rid of her?"" I freeze, though a part of me has always known this day would come. Edward nods. ""We have to kill her."" My heart races as repulsion mixes with elation. I don't reply at first, but I know in my heart that there's nothing I won't do for Edward Masen. He owns me. He controls me. And I live to please him. Hosts Note: Please leave the author some love by leaving a review.

265,4,29,4-ControlPossessSeduceContest-29.txt,twilight,ControlPossessSeduceContest,"Edward chuckled. 'Yes, lovely Bella. But it's not by chance. They're oh so good at making women swoon, and tasting the sweetness when I kiss then is so fucking good.' He replied, gathering me into his arms and kissing me to prove his point. The strawberry juice was indeed heavenly as his lips moved against mine, nipping and teasing as his tongue explored my mouth. I barely even noticed he had pushed me down to the bed, his hard body covering mine. It wasn't until his hands grabbed my dress and started tugging that I realized what he was doing, and we broke apart so that he could pull it the rest of the way over my head. Then he quickly shucked his own shirt off before his mouth started moving over my skin. He trailed kisses across my jaw, down my neck, along my collar bone, as his hands traced patterns across my stomach. Soon his lips were trailing across the tops of my breasts, as one of his hands deftly unhooked my bra and tossed it across the room. I moaned as his mouth immediately latched onto my right nipple, sending spikes of pleasure through me and making my inner walls clench. His fingers swirled and teased my other breast as he licked my pink flesh, making me squirm with desire. Then his hands were shifting and he was gently pushing me to roll onto my stomach. 'Roll, sweetheart.' He whispered as he moved me. I couldn't help but protest, wanting him back where he was. 'Why?' I asked breathlessly. I couldn't see Edward's face, but imagined him grinning at the word. 'Because I want to taste your smooth back, Bella. And because you'll feel everything so much better when you can't see what I'm doing.' He replied, his lips kissing the back of my neck as he brushed my hair aside. His hands rubbed up and down my sides as he kissed and licked his way down my back, making me tremble. Edward was right. Not being able to see, only feeling his touch made my senses heighten. My nerves were buzzing with anticipation. He was getting lower, lower, close to where I wanted him. His fingers hooked into the sides of my underwear and slid them quickly down my legs as he kissed the end of my spine. Then he was quickly pulling me upwards, my back against his chest and my ass against his hips. I gasped at the sudden movement, my breaths turning into desperate pants. I could feel his hard erection pressing against my ass, his strong thighs beneath my own. We were completely pressed together, one of his hands cupping my breasts as his other hand trailed down my stomach to lightly circle my clit. I moaned loudly as he thumbed my g-spot, leaning heavily against his bare body as he sent desire radiating through every fiber of my being. Furious heat was building in my lower stomach, wetness pooling between my legs. I sighed in relief as two of his fingers dipped between my folds and pushed into me, finally going where I wanted him most. Unlike in the taxi, where we had been restricted by clothes and positions, Edward wasn't holding back this time. He was exploring every inch of me, moving deep, stretching me wide and making me quiver. Soon he added a third finger, relentlessly teasing my clit and rapidly bringing me to my climax. I cried out and shook in his tight grip, the orgasm he had built up overwhelming. But still, I wanted more. I needed more than his hand, I needed his thick cock. And he knew it. He had done this to me. He had well and truly seduced me. He could control me. And now he was about to possess me. I hadn't even finished calming down and he was already sliding his hard length through my slick folds, teasing me, tempting me, torturing me. It wasn't until I whimpered with need that he finally grabbed my hips and lifted me so that he could slide firmly in, impaling me on his erection. He was all the way in, as deep as he could go, his head pressing against the end of me and letting me know I was totally at his mercy. That I belonged to him. Unlike the furious sex against the wall we had had earlier, his movements now were achingly slow. With every roll of his hips he slid all the way out and all the way in, claiming every part of me. He grinded and thrust at every angle, hitting the best spots inside of me until I was on the edge of my climax and then slowing again, refusing to let me shatter. His hand was still playing with my clit, bringing me high when he wanted to and leaving me gasping when I got to close to orgasm. It was ecstasy, the most extreme pleasure, the most overwhelming elation. Eventually not even Edward could stop me from succumbing to the blissful euphoria, my climax wracking through my body so fiercely I thought my heart would fail beneath the onslaught. Only it didn't. It kept beating, as Edward and I fell to the bed, his cock still buried inside of me. It was then that I knew there was no longer any question. Edward was just as good as he thought he was. Better even. He had controlled me. Possessed me. Seduced me. The End Hosts Note: Please leave the author some love by leaving a review.

266,4,37,4-ControlPossessSeduceContest-37.txt,twilight,ControlPossessSeduceContest,"wasn't completely new, but it was a feeling that wasn't common. She could only whimper. He leaned close. ""Bella, I asked if you liked it,"" Edward said. ""Yes,"" she whispered. He pushed a finger in softly and slowly. He never stopped the steady motion of his hips. She felt like she was on sensory overload. She gasped. ""Does it hurt?"" he asked. He was sliding the finger in and out so carefully. Slower than the rhythm of his cock but just as fluidly. ""Yes….but its ok,"" she choked out. ""Good."" Her body opened to him as he moved. It felt good and forbidden, and she didn't want him to stop. Then he slid out. Completely. She felt the head of his dick nudge the hole where his finger had left. She whimpered. He laid his chest against her back. His cock was nudging at her tight hole ever so slightly. ""Is it ok?"" he asked softly. ""Yes,"" she panted, both scared and exhilarated. -YNGIMP- Edward's heart pounded in his chest when he heard that affirmation come from her mouth. He nearly finished at just the thought of sliding himself into that tight hole. He moved in slowly, stopping every time her soft cries grew sharper. With one hand, he was guiding himself in. With the other, he softly stoked her clit and occasionally slid a finger in and out of her entrance. She was still dripping wet. She wanted this as much as he did, and that made it that much harder to hold off his release. He worked himself all the way into her and stilled the movement of his cock. He groaned into the soft skin of her neck, and for a couple of moments, he laid there feeling the insane tightness wrapped around him. He didn't stop the motion of his hand. She was whimpering again. And eventually, she was the one who goaded him into sliding in and out so slowly by bucking her hips. Then he was falling over the edge of his control. He was cumming and it felt like an explosion. He couldn't rein in the growling groan that ripped out of his throat. He collapsed on top of her and found himself listening to both of their breaths and hearts slow. ""Fucking wow,"" he muttered. ""Umm,"" was the only response from under him. He took that as seconding his ""fucking wow"". He pulled out, and she yelped. ""Fuck, I'm so sorry!"" he cried, dropping back down next to her. He pulled her close and kissed her forehead as she looked at him. ""So sorry."" She gave him a small smile. ""It's ok. Just wasn't expecting,"" she replied. She was quiet for a moment. It occurred to him this was the moment when he'd typically ease the night's conquest out the door. This was different. He just wanted to sleep. And he wanted to wake up with her next to him. He wanted in her again. ""Bathroom?"" she asked, pulling him from his thoughts. ""Huh?"" It was his turn to be startled. ""Oh, yeah."" -YNGIMP- When Bella came back from the bathroom, she set about finding her clothes. She had sobered up considerably and was quite aware of her nakedness. ""Need these?"" He was lounging on the bed, wearing his boxer briefs. Her underwear dangled from his index finger. He was smirking again. ""Yes, please,"" she said, walking over to grab them. When she reached for them, he caught her wrist and drew her to him to kiss her. She didn't resist. His mouth felt too good. She figured he would send her on her way soon, but she didn't think just a few more minutes of pretend could hurt. He tossed her skimpy underwear back to the floor and walked over to his dresser. He pulled out a pair of shorts and tossed them to her. ""I imagine those'll be more comfortable."" He turned to root out a wife beater. ""You're not going to take me home?"" she asked softly. ""Nope."" He turned and tossed the shirt to her. She pulled the clothes on without taking her eyes off him. Her head was spinning. ""I want you to stay,"" he said, walking back to the bed and dropping down. ""I mean, if you want to."" For just a moment, he looked vulnerable. ""Um, sure,"" she agreed. ""I want you to stay for a while,"" he said. She looked at him curiously. ""Look, I know you're expecting some bullshit from me. And bullshit is usually what I do, but … God this sounds trite… it's different this time."" He was bumbling. He ran his hand through his hair distractedly. ""Fuck. I don't know how to say this shit…"" ""More than sex?"" she asked, arching an eyebrow. It was an interesting thought. Having more than sex with Edward sounded very enticing. He smiled. ""Yeah, more than sex. I don't know what else, though."" He looked a bit sheepish. ""Have you ever… more than sex?"" Bella asked. He shook his head. ""Never wanted to before."" She studied him. He really was amazing looking. She thought briefly about everything that led up to that night. He really had been determined to be with her. ""Ok, then we'll try more than sex,"" she said with a smile. She dropped back and snuggled into his pillows. ""But let's try sleep now."" He smiled as he laid down beside her. He brushed her nipple through the thin cotton of the shirt. ""But in the morning, more sex."" Hosts Note: Please leave the author some love by leaving a review.

267,4,3,4-ControlPossessSeduceContest-3.txt,twilight,ControlPossessSeduceContest,"coffee, and then Belgian waffles for the hell of it. We were celebrating. There was a realtor a couple of doors up, so I perused the images of the properties for sale. They were mostly big rambling homes with price tags to match, not really what I had in mind. According to the map in the catalog, there was a smaller house two streets back, and since I had a couple of minutes, I decided to take a run up and have a look. It was an odd sort of place with a jumble of extensions, married together by vertical siding. I started to walk back, thinking of sizzling bacon, stopping in my tracks when I glimpsed the view from the front of the house, obscured by the roof in front. Similar to our hotel, it looked directly up the length of the lake, over the marinas and on to Mt. Ranier. With its location, an easy walk to the water and restaurants, a new multi-story home, even a small one, would turn this into something worth three times what they were asking. I had to get back to Bella. My order was ready and I added a newspaper, shoving it under my arm with the realtor's catalog, so I could juggle the coffees and breakfast-to-go container. As I placed the coffees on the ground to open our door, Bella opened it for me, greeting me with a beaming smile and a kiss. I dropped the newspaper and catalog on a chair and we took the breakfast to the small table outside. They had nicely packaged it with two sturdy cardboard plates, cutlery and napkins. The food itself was presented so we could serve ourselves and I kissed her when I saw how pleased she was with my order. As we ate, I told her about the house I'd seen. ""Did you bring their pamphlet back?"" she asked and I tipped my chin toward the chair inside. She came out, lifting the catalog and glancing at the headlines of the newspaper, turning sheet white and sitting down, reading the whole article. ""What's happened?"" Visibly shaking, she handed the newspaper over and sat back in her chair, glassy-eyed. ""WEALTHY FINANCIER JAMES MASEN ARRESTED IN STRANGULATION MURDER OF ESTRANGED WIFE VICTORIA."" Looking up at Bella, I struggled to swallow the mouthful of food before reading the paragraphs below the headline. ""Mr. Masen called police to report the murder last night, with no memory of what happened to his wife. Victoria Masen's neck was broken when she was viciously strangled with a piece of rope that Mr. Masen denied was his, although a hardware store bag was collected from the bathroom at the crime scene, containing the same rope with a receipt dated two weeks ago. Security footage shows James Masen leaving the store at the time of purchase. He denies that he had any plans to kill his wife, but police are now linking the murder to another missing person's case involving Mr. Masen's former private assistant, Jessica Stanley, who has been missing since she left his employ. Police are urgently searching for a male aged 27 and a female aged 26 to assist with their investigation."" Reading it again, it was hard to pinpoint my emotions. Even though she and Vicky hadn't been close in years, Mom would be a mess, coming to terms with the loss of her cousin. Dad would already be compiling evidence for the prosecutor. He'd be determined to see Masen brought to justice and I would offer my help in any way I could. Now, instead of a leisurely morning riding around Gig Harbor, we'd have to return to Seattle and face a day of questions from the police. Bella jumped up, mumbling frantically while she turned on her phone. ""We have to call in and tell them we had nothing to do with the murder. This looks like we've run from the scene of a crime."" Her phone pinged several times and she said, ""Oh God, I've got fifteen messages. I'll call Dad. He'll know what we should do."" Overwhelmed, my mind couldn't get past one fact. I went inside, sitting on the bed and taking her hand. ""Bella, before you call him, I want to ask you a question. Dad said Vicky hadn't been back here in years. Vicky herself told me yesterday she hadn't seen Masen, in her words, 'in too long,' and that she'd flown in to surprise him. He may be telling the truth that he had no plans to kill her."" Clutching my wrist, she replied, ""What's the question, Edward? Do I want to hear this?"" ""It's more than one question and you may be the only one who holds the answers. What's he doing with the rope? Think back to two weeks ago. Vicky told me he was a control freak. Was that when you said no to New York? Why would he go into a hardware store to buy rope and then leave it in the bathroom of his office? You said yourself he was in the bathroom, upset after you resigned."" ""Say it… say it out loud. I can take it."" Only yesterday, we'd been joking about her surviving Masen, and now… ""Who do you think the rope was meant for, Bella?"" ""Oh my God,"" she answered with her hands covering her mouth and her eyes closed. All I could do was reassure her with the safety of my arms and let it sink in.

268,4,21,4-ControlPossessSeduceContest-21.txt,twilight,ControlPossessSeduceContest,"notoriety. I would just put you in danger if I stayed with you."" He gripped her hand tight and the tears that had pooled in the bottom of her eyes spilled over. The naive child fought within her, urging this man to stay, to fill her with his love and his soul despite the danger. The sensible part of her, the hard part that had hidden Jasper's body in a place that would buy her enough time to get Renee and her badly hurt infant child out of the state, the part that had thought to take enough valuables to trade for a new identity, took control. A strong sense of self-preservation had kept her from the gallows this long and just as she had learned to trust it in the past she knew to listen to it now. ""Help me onto the horse then, the bay's a little bigger than I'm used to."" He nodded and she could see the lump in this throat, the way that his lips trembled as he fought back his emotions. Without words he got to his feet and helped her up. He embraced her briefly, more businesslike than the hold of a lover. She tried to remember that moment, the way that he smelled, the way that he held her to him, the knotted scar on his shoulder, his slim waist, but there was too many details, too much of this man to take in. She deliberately avoided his eyes as he boosted her into the saddle then held onto the reins as she adjusted the stirrups and tucked her hair into the wide brimmed hat. ""Goodbye Edward,"" she tried to be strong but the tears flowed again and this time she didn't try to wipe them away. ""Goodbye Bella,"" his voice cracked and the tears that he had been holding back made his eyes wild and glassy. She didn't ask him exactly where he was going because that sort of knowledge was the kind of thing that could get them both strung up. His admission of his real name had already brought her further into his web of duplicity yet she appreciated the fact that he trusted her with that information. It gave her something real to remember him by, a name that she could roll over her tongue like a bitter-sweet sugary treat. He let go of the reins and she kicked the bay into a walk, then a trot. His hooves raised little plumes of dust with each step and she pulled up the bandana to protect her nose and mouth. The tears didn't stop but she made herself look forward, not back. In the cold light of day the decision was the correct one but she didn't think that her resolve would hold if she looked back and saw him watching her leave. ""Bella, you're back!"" Jake, standing on the wooden verandah of the saloon to case out the stranger riding up the street was clearly pleased to see that it was her. ""I am,"" said Bella, sliding off of the horse. It was only grabbing onto the saddle bag as she hit the ground that stopped her exhausted legs crumpling underneath her. She had ridden for twenty four hours straight to get back to Rhyolite, stopping only for the most urgent calls of nature. ""Could you put the contents of the saddlebags into the safe and ask Renee to heat the water for a bath?"" ""I surely can,"" he said, helping her wobbly form up the stairs with a strong arm. The girls fussed and flapped around her, oohing and aahing at the her strange attire and then the sight of the loot. She let them fuss, answering their questions with brief, non-committal answers but when the copper bath was full she shooed them out of the room and locked the door. The breath rushed out of her chest in a half sigh, half groan as she eased her aching muscles into the hot water, little scratches and raw patches on her lower back and bottom reminding her of the rough ground scraping against them in delicious pain but two nights previously. Yet with stillness came sadness. Her share of the proceeds would secure the future of the saloon, giving the girls a future beyond whoring and moving her into a whole new, legitimate business sphere. So why did the tears flow down her cheek unchecked? Why did her whole body rack with sobs so visceral that they seemed to rip into her soul as well as her body? Why did giving up Edward Cullen feel like the hardest thing that she had ever had to do in a life already dogged by hardship? She let the sorrow possess her, working through her until the water was cold and the girls knocked at the door in concern. As the sun went down and the room fell into darkness she rose from the cold water, drying herself briefly and getting back into a silk gown of gay red silk. It felt strange after her masculine attire of the last few days. She called Renee in to help her with the final fastenings then put the little Derringer into the skirt pocket, the knife back into the bodice and the larger knife into her boot. Smoothing her skirts she painted on a smile and opened the door to the bustling saloon just as Renee turned the handle to bring the hurdy gurdy organ burst back into jangling life.

269,4,4,4-ControlPossessSeduceContest-4.txt,twilight,ControlPossessSeduceContest,"you looked at me like the way you are now…"" I smirk, enjoying the way her mouth move as she talks. ""I froze up. Then it became a game, like foreplay."" ""Yeah, I bet your boyfriend fucking appreciated you giving another guy blue balls,"" I spit, untangling her arms from around me. She frowns. ""I never had a boyfriend."" ""Game's over, little girl."" I take another step back, suddenly needing a smoke and some fucking space. I'd still follow this girl to the depths of hell and be her pussy-whipped puppy dog, but she doesn't need to know that shit. ""Jacob? Really? I wouldn't date him if my life depended on it."" I stop patting my pockets and look back up at her. ""You fucking lied to me?"" ""It didn't take me long to have you all figured out, Edward."" She hooks her fingers into the loop of my jeans and playfully pulls. ""I knew thinking I had a boyfriend would only make you want me more."" I don't know whether to find this all cute or be pissed at her for playing more fucking games with me. ""Admit it. You get off on the chase."" ""Fuck that. I wanted to kill that scrawny little kid."" I bend down and sink my teeth into that pouty, lying bottom lip of hers until she yelps out in pain. After pushing her back into the truck, I finally find my smokes and light one up. ""I'd rather you'd been straight with me from day one."" ""Oh, yeah? And say what? 'Hi, Edward. I've had a crazy crush on you since I was ten. Would you like a side of pussy with that pie?' Yeah. I'm sure that would've been real appealing."" ""Actually, I wou–"" I stop for a second when what she said actually hits me. ""Wait. What? A crush on me since you were ten ? What are you talking about?"" I pull from my cigarette like a life source, watching baby girl smooth her hair down. She's chewing on her already tattered and swollen bottom lip nervously, a habit that makes me want to bend that ass over and bang it out of her. ""You were my first crush,"" she finally admits, speaking softly now. ""I know this town's always hated you, but even then, I saw something in you they didn't."" I blow smoke in her face but wave it away with my hand. She's unfazed and takes a deep breath to continue. ""When I was a kid, I spent every summer day at the diner with my mom while she worked. You were in high school, and you came in all the time for a slice of cherry pie and ice cold milk."" I blink at her, taken back. ""You remember that?"" She nods, biting at her thumbnail now. ""One day, Lauren Stanley was there with me, and these three boys kept making fun of her new haircut. Brian Peters said she looked like a dyke, and you called over to him from the counter, telling him if he didn't leave Lauren alone, you'd kick his ass so hard that his balls would retract and everyone would start calling him Briana."" I laugh. I have no recollection of the incident, but it sounds like something I'd say. ""You remember all that, little girl?"" I smirk around my cigarette. ""I must've left quite the impression on you."" She smiles, sticking her leg out to rub her foot up and down my calf. ""You did. You've always been an asshole, but what you said to Brian that day came from a good place. It didn't matter that the whole town hated your family or that everyone in the diner that day had labeled you a little trouble-making hoodlum. You stuck up for Lauren because it was the right thing to do."" ""So you've been crushing on me for years because I told off some little shit? Damn, baby. With the number of people I've mouthed off to, your body should be covered in tats."" She shakes her head at me, giggling like what I said is silly but not completely off the mark. ""I got the tattoo as a reminder of you from that day — a reminder that there's good in everyone, even people who've been written off by the rest of the world."" I don't know what to think of that. It's been a long time since anyone's used 'good' in relation to me. ""I didn't know I'd ever actually have the chance to be with you."" The chance? That baffles me. She talks like I'm a fucking catch or something. ""Is that what you want? To be with me?"" She's wrong about me. I'm not good. I'm not some righteous prize of a man. I'm not boyfriend material, and I sure as fuck am not good enough for baby girl. What I am, however, is a selfish prick, and if this sweet slice of cherry pie wants me, then so fucking be it. She can have my body, my soul, and every fucked up thing that comes with it. ""I've never wanted anything more in my life, Edward."" My heart hammers, and my dick stirs. ""I've already told you I'm yours."" ""And I've already told you…"" I toss my cigarette to the ground, and in seconds, my hands are in her hair, yanking and tilting her head up as I put my lips to her ear. ""If you let me, I'll fucking love you forever."" Hosts Note: Please leave the author some love by leaving a review.

270,4,28,4-ControlPossessSeduceContest-28.txt,twilight,ControlPossessSeduceContest,"lips, pooling on the surface underneath her. I watched it's path, transfixed, then picked up the pot and poured even more onto her. ""Mine."" I hadn't meant to say that word but that is what came out between my lips as I bent forward and took the large slice of mango dripping in chocolate out of her pussy. I bent my head back and let it slide into my mouth. Fuck, I thought, that tastes delicious. What is it about her that takes all these flavours to another level? It made me smile to think of diners eating mango flavoured with her pussy juices. Then only a second after that another, stronger, sensation hit me. I didn't want anyone else to taste this. I looked down at her again as she lay just as I had told her too, the small metal pan on her hand and the residue of the fondue all over her lower stomach and pussy. An unusual possessive feeling washed over me. I picked up a clean cloth and tenderly started to wipe up some of the fondue now that I realised I couldn't possibly lick it all up. I hoped the sensation of the rough kitchen cloth would be almost as welcoming as my tongue was going to be. I opened her legs a little wider and cleaned up some of the spilt chocolate, the sight that met me would supply material for my early morning shower sessions for years to come. The glistening chocolate had mixed with the juices from the mango and left an almost shiny, thin glaze on her lips. I needed her in a different position. I needed to be able to get to her body without having to lean over her so I picked her up in my arms and carried her back to the chef's table, sitting her on the edge of it and pushing open her thighs. Kneeling down before her the aroma hit me instantly, her arousal, chocolate and mango, it was too much to resist. I placed my hands on her breasts and pushed her backwards so she was laid back on the table with her thighs stretched as wide as they would go. I wanted to start with a single finger but I needed to clean up all the chocolate first. I couldn't risk getting too much inside in case it caused her a problem later, so I lapped and licked to clean her up. I lapped at her outer lips, between them and moved up to pull back the hood of her clit and clean all around the little bundle of nerves. I knew as she got wetter she would clean herself internally and then I would really be able to enjoy her. As I worked my way down her opening I put my hands under her buttocks and lifted her slightly so that I could clean past her pussy and right round to her other hole. There was chocolate on her buttocks but I could get to that later, for now I needed to make sure everything was gone. When the taste on my tongue changed from the chocolate creation to just Bella I knew I could move forward and take her. We were both so worked up now it wasn't going to take much for either of us to come. I knew Bella was close, I could feel her squirming and the flow of her pussy juices had increased tremendously. I couldn't wait any longer so I quickly unzipped my chef pants and lowered them along with my boxers and finally let my swollen dick spring free. Without a moment's hesitation I pushed into her until I felt my balls push up against her. We were totally unaware of our surroundings as I continued to thrust into Bella until my balls were screaming, they were so full and heavy it was causing me actual pain each time they slapped against her. I knew I should have a condom on, that I should have at least asked her if she was clean and protected but in that moment I didn't care about the consequences. She screamed her climax, her body contracting around my cock, the little silver bowl finally crashing to the ground. My own orgasm was triggered almost immediately, a release so intense that it was actually painful. Any thought of a good review was completely forgotten. All I could think as I poured myself into her was ""mine"". Second Review of L'expérience by I.M.S. Now, any of you that follow this blog regularly, know that I very rarely give second chances. However, I have to admit that I have done exactly that with Chef Cullen's establishment. My wife was adamant that this was where she wanted to go to celebrate her 60 th birthday recently. So, it was with a heavy heart that I booked a table for last Friday night. That special something that was missing the night of my visit, Chef Cullen has certainly put it right. The food was amazing, the atmosphere electric and it was obvious that every diner was having an amazing evening. It was as though the whole establishment had been given a lift of some sort. Whatever has happened let's hope it continues. Also, I must take a minute to recommend you try the chocolate fondue. It is so very eighties I know, but it is one of the most delicious deserts I have ever eaten. Perhaps there is a secret ingredient? Hosts Note: Please leave the author some love by leaving a review.

271,4,0,4-ControlPossessSeduceContest-0.txt,twilight,ControlPossessSeduceContest,"society. Shifting slightly in the seat, I adjusted my dick that had perked up and was straining against my pants at the memory of Isabella's hot, wet pussy wrapped around it. The plan had been just to have Newton find us together. The rest… well, I'd gotten a bit carried away at the sight of her. The impending success of my revenge had given me an unprecedented high. Plus, we had some time to kill (pun intended) until the poison reached his system, so that the time of his attack would correspond with the shock of seeing us together. As it was, I knew Isabella didn't mind. I could still taste the sweet musk of her arousal on my tongue. All in all, it was an easy explanation. Even if the police somehow suspected foul play, the crystals would have disappeared from his blood stream long before they even thought of performing an autopsy. The final item I pulled out of the clutch was the only one I was going to save. I twirled the flash drive in my palm, just the thought of its contents satiating the fire of revenge that'd burned in my heart since the day my father had committed suicide. Every bit of proof against Newton Corporation that had eluded my father now lay in the palm of my hand and would make its way to the authorities in due time. Anonymously, of course. Michael Newton had already lost his life. Soon, his entire family would lose their reputation. I would make sure of it. I placed everything back inside the little purse and tucked it back into the breast pocket of my jacket. My phone chimed with a message, and the ringtone indicated that it was from one of the burner phones I'd bought with this very night in mind. Done with the questioning. See you at home! Love you. With a peaceful smile, I let my eyes drift close and relaxed for the rest of the ride home. I couldn't wait to finally be able to sleep while holding her in my arms. It had been one very long month. ~*O*O*O*O*~ With the tears came the harsh realization that I would never get the chance to talk to my father. I had lost the opportunity to apologize to him or mend fences. He would not be there for any of the future milestones in my life. He would never know that despite our contrasting ideals, I loved him with all my heart. A strangled scream escaped my lips as I clawed at my hair, welcoming the pain that, for just a second, distracted me from the horrible reality I now faced. It was only when I felt someone's presence behind me that I raised my tear-streaked face from my hands and looked up. My fiancée placed a hand on my shoulder while tears trickled down her face. I stood up and quickly pulled her into my arms, letting my head fall into the crook of her neck as I mourned the loss of my father. Her soft hands caressed the back of my neck and threaded through my hair, murmuring words of comfort, even as her own voice shuddered with tears. We stayed there for a few minutes, locked in a tight embrace while we waited for the ambulance and the police to arrive. Finally, she whispered my name with a shocked note in her voice. When I pulled back, I found her haunted eyes fixed on a letter placed on Dad's table. Reaching out to grab it, I gasped when I saw that it was addressed to me. She held my trembling form as I tore open the envelope and glanced at the letter. Reading through the paragraphs, unbridled rage rose within my mind and soaked every pore of my body as I realized the awful fate my father had to face in return for his honesty. I'd wanted to announce my engagement to him today… tell him that I'd finally met the love of my life and that she was the one who encouraged me to mend fences with him… that I regretted all the time we'd lost in our petty fights, and wanted to make sure that we didn't lose any more. Now I'd lost that chance forever. It had been stolen from me… from us. In his last letter, Dad had given me the name of the man who was responsible for it. "" Michael Newton,"" I spat wildly. ""He ruined Dad's reputation. He destroyed everything that Dad held close to his heart, and weakened him to the point that he felt that this was his only way out. Damn it!"" I roared. ""The police can't see this… Not right now. I'm going to finish what Dad started. I don't know how, but I'm going to make sure that Newton meets the miserable end that he deserves. I will ruin him!"" She took my shaking hand in hers, opened up my clenched fist, and entwined our fingers together. It was such a simple act, but the warmth of her touch emboldened me like nothing else could. The sight of our fingers meshed together as one unit was enough to reassure me. My anguished heart grew a tad lighter, and I knew I wasn't alone in this. My Isabella, my love, gently wiped away my tears, as her chocolate eyes blazed boldly and decisively into mine. "" We will, Edward. You and me, together… Always. We will ruin him.""

272,4,5,4-ControlPossessSeduceContest-5.txt,twilight,ControlPossessSeduceContest,"My god, you don't even know what you want."" I groaned in frustration and turned to leave. I couldn't deal with this now, I had to think. Before I could fully open the door his hand slammed it shut and he spun me around. His mouth meeting mine in a hard, unforgiving kiss. "" Your mine Bella, I can't fight it any longer."" I kissed him back, putting all my anger into it. His arm comes around the small of my back, crushing me to his chest. I don't understand what changed. "" Stop overthinking it, just feel."" He pulls me to his desk. Both of our hands working on each others clothes. I had his shirt off and my blouse had been ripped open in his frustration. He sat down on his desk, pulling me to him. My hands worked his zipper down, pushing his pants to his knees. My skirt was hitched up to my waist, his hand pulling at my underwear, snapping my panties in half at the crotch. "" Stop destroying my clothes,"" I mumbled between kisses. "" Shut up, I will buy you new ones."" He reaches down and pulls his wallet from his desk drawer, removing a condom and rolling it on. He grasped my legs, pulling them up around his waist, he leaned back so I was straddling his lap, leaning up on his elbows. "" Put me inside Bella,"" I grabbed him, placing him at my entrance, ""Lower yourself slowly, Miss Swan."" My eyes flicked to his, his smile was wicked. "" Yes, Mr. Cullen,"" my eyes close as I sink down onto him. "" Ohhhhh,"" I groan, feeling each and every inch of him inside me, ""So deep."" I lower myself slowly, pausing a little halfway down. He lies back, his legs hanging over the edge and grabs my breast. His thumb circles my nipple and my legs begin to shake as I struggle to keep my position. ""Come on Miss Swan, take all of me."" He pinches my nipple making me moan. I lower myself all the way, my head falling back. One hand leaves my breast and slides up my body and onto my throat, his whole palm covering it. Grasping gently, he pulls me down, kissing my lips as my hands find his shoulders, giving me more leverage. "" Now fuck me, Miss Swan."" I kiss him back, pushing up with my knees a little before dropping back down. It was a lot clumsier than I planned, but it had been a while. I continued to move slowly at first, but soon got into a steady rhythm, he starts to rotate his hips in time with my movements. "" Does it feel good, Miss Swan?"" he groans, flexing his hips. "" Yes,"" I pant, ""so good."" My legs and arms are visibly shaking now and I was finding it hard to keep the rhythm. Sensing my growing tiredness, he pulls himself up grasping my bottom, he plants his feet on the floor, his legs firmly apart and starts to move fully with me. My arms wrap around his neck as he takes complete control of my body, moving it as he wants. "" So fucking good, never knew,"" He mumbles between kisses. "" Oh, god,"" I feel the pleasure build as his hips loose rhythm, he's close. "" Come, Bella,"" My breath stutters out, I need to come, so bad. "" Now, Miss Swan. Come now,"" and that was all it took to bring us both over the edge. ~~CC~~ We lay in a sweaty heap on his bed, our breathing was the only sound in the room, I lay staring at the ceiling a huge smile on my face. ""What are you thinking about?"" I turned and looked into his beautiful green eyes. ""How we met and last week when you finally pulled your head out of your ass."" His laugh echoes through the room and he leans over to kiss my lips gently. ""I will be sad to see you go to Accounting. I will miss seeing your gorgeous face in my office, but I guess I will have to make do with seeing you at lunch and after work."" I smile, happy that a suitable replacement had been found. ""Don't worry, there are still places we need to christen, I promise to bring you lunch whenever I can."" I wink at him. ""Mmmm… elevator sex."" His smile is full of promise. ""Yeah,"" I shiver at the thought of him pinning me to the wall of the elevator. ""Let me take you to dinner."" I look at him puzzled, he looked panicked. ""I haven't even taken you on a date,"" he sat up looking at me wide-eyed. ""We've been fucking for a week and we haven't had a date."" I laugh, ""You act like we've never been out together. We've been to lunch and dinner many times Edward."" I lean up and kiss his lips. ""Don't worry, I'm fine."" ""I'm not. I'm not fine Bella. We need to go on a date. I want you to get dressed up. I want you to feel special."" ""Okay, so what time are you picking me up?"" I smiled at him and pulled the sheet down showing my breasts, ""And you always make me feel special."" My fingers plucked at my nipple. His eyes never left my hand, ""Is seven good?"" He gulped when I palmed them, his gaze completely focused on my movements. ""Seven's good handsome.""

273,4,7,4-ControlPossessSeduceContest-7.txt,twilight,ControlPossessSeduceContest,"the dining room to the living room, where I find the image of utter devastation and lies. My mother stands in the corner, her hands over her mouth in shock while my father stands beside her, his scotch swishing in his glass. Ever the picture of ease. Carlisle is in the middle of the room, trying to restrain a hysterical Esme. She screams and yells, punching his chest, yelling obscenities at him. Until her eyes land on me. ""You little whore!"" She charges at me, only to be yanked back by Carlisle. ""You've ruined my entire life!"" ""No need for dramatics, Esme,"" my father sighs, sipping on his beverage. ""You're a slut!"" Esme wails at me, ignoring him. ""Couldn't find a boy your own age, so you had to go after a married man? You're sick!"" I stare at her, not feeling an ounce of remorse for her fake tears. Not when my dad's eyes are focused on her ass and Carlisle is staring at my tits. The fucking hypocrisy. ""You've ripped my family apart! We treated you like our own."" She points a finger in my face. ""You were like a sister to my Rosalie, and now she's left home because of you! You're a disgrace!"" I scoff. ""That's it? You're not even going to explain yourself?"" she yells. I snap. ""Explain myself? Okay, how's this? It was Carlisle that started it. He grabbed my ass. He made advances. He lured me to a fucking motel. And as for decency? I have none. I learned how to cheat and lie from the best of them. You. All of you."" I glance around them as they fall silent. ""After all, Esme, you've been fucking around with my dad for nearly twelve years now, right?"" Her eyes widen, and the façade of the poor, heartbroken wife drops. She turns to Carlisle, who stares at her with disbelief and fury. Behind them, my mom places a hand dramatically on her chest, but her reaction falls flat and stale. ""Don't look so shocked, Mom,"" I call to her. ""They were at it while you were with Mr. Banner. And then Mr. Weber."" My father still looks uninterested. ""I'm the result of your fucking actions. Me? Rose? We're your Goddamn collateral damage. It falls on you, the way we grew up. The lifestyle you got us caught up in. You're the failures, not us."" They still stand, staring. ""I may be a royal fuck up, but it's all of you that are the disgraceful ones."" I don't say anything else. I just leave them there, the ugly truth laid out before them as I slam my bedroom door closed. . . . . It's late in the night, but I'm still wide awake. After the spat downstairs, the house had promptly emptied. My dad left for London. Esme and Carlisle went home, I'm assuming. And my mom disappeared. She'd tried to come in and have a chat, but words had failed her. She simply kissed my cheek and told me she'd be back in the morning. There was no need to lie when we knew the truth. I think she gets that now. Two taps on the window make me jump, but I smile when I see Edward dangling outside on the lattice. I let him in, watching as he folds himself through the window. ""You could've used the door,"" I point out. ""Felt better this way."" He smirks, shrugging. ""Like old times."" I smile a real smile for the first time in God knows how long. ""I'm heading back tonight."" My smile drops. ""Oh."" ""Emmett already left."" He rubs the back of his neck. ""Rosalie's with him."" My eyes widen. ""Really? Wow."" ""I know."" He nods. ""Are you… I mean, are you staying?"" ""I'm leaving."" I point to the suitcase by the door, freshly packed an hour ago. I revel in the fact he looks disappointed. ""Oh, that's…. that's great. Where you headed?"" ""I actually don't know."" I tell him the truth. ""It's just time to leave, you know?"" He nods, hesitating for a second before lacing one finger with mine. ""You could come with me."" My heart thumps. ""If you want, I mean,"" he backtracks. ""Like…"" I trail off. ""Like we could try again,"" he says softly, pulling me closer. ""Fresh start, away from here."" ""But… we're a disaster."" I chuckle without humor. There's nothing funny here. ""True."" He nods. ""But I'm not over this. Over you."" He looks up at me. ""Just come. No promises. No plans. Just get in the car, and let's take it as it comes."" I breathe. I nod. And I smile. ""Okay."" He kisses me tenderly, and I wrap my arms around him, anchoring him to me. Where he's always belonged. It may not work. I may fall back into bad habits contained at the bottom of a bag. He may get sick of me or cheat on me. I may end up hating him. Or we could end up blissfully happy. Who knows? But in the darkness of my bedroom, with his arms around me, I feel loved and protected. I feel the truth of the boy who sent me on the wrong path, then put me back on the right one when I strayed too far. The boy who made a mistake, nothing compared to mine, yet still stands here asking me to take a chance with him. In the thick of it all, there only is one choice. And it's him.

274,4,10,4-ControlPossessSeduceContest-10.txt,twilight,ControlPossessSeduceContest,"didn't give me a chance to tell you I'm on the pill."" He grinned widely, ""You don't know how happy you've just made me."" ""Maybe you could show me? Repeatedly and at length?"" ""There's nothing I'd like more, Sweetheart."" And Edward reached out and pulled a giggling Bella under the bed covers. -ooo- Bella woke up just before the alarm went off and knowing they were booked onto an early flight, she decided it wasn't worth trying to get back to sleep. Being careful not to disturb Edward, she slipped out of bed and crept over to the fridge. She didn't want to waste the carton of chocolate ice-cream she'd bought the day before and after searching for a spoon, she took the tub over to the window to watch the sun come up. After prolonging their stay in Cologne for a week, during which they'd barely left their hotel room, they'd reluctantly decided it was time to go back to London, and Bella was feeling slightly anxious about having to find a new job while she decided what to do next. She'd have to wait another year to start, but perhaps she'd take a degree in a subject she really wanted to study this time, or perhaps she'd try to become a writer, which had been her secret childhood dream. She was sad when she thought about all the years she'd wasted, trying to make the most of what her mother and then Mike had expected of her, years she could have spent with Edward, if only she'd been brave enough. But at least, miraculously, they were together now and she felt so relieved he'd found her again that her eyes filled with tears. She loved him so much, and she was never going to let go of him now. Already thinking about which items of furniture she would get rid of and which would fit into Edward's thankfully very large house, she couldn't help a quick shimmy as she quietly hummed a happy tune to herself. Then, remembering the ice cream, she ate another spoonful, while she watched the sun turn the river and the sky from grey to pink and then to gold. Hearing a slight noise, she turned away from the window and saw Edward was awake and smiling at her. ""Is that chocolate ice cream you're eating?"" ""Mmmh, this Italian ice cream is heavenly. I could eat it all day. Is it true you've got a place in Italy? I'd love to go there. For the ice cream mainly, obviously."" ""I'd gladly take you anywhere you want, My Love. And that reminds me, could you just come back to bed for a second? There's something which needs your urgent attention."" Laughing at his corny line and bringing the last of the ice-cream with her, because she rather liked the thought of making Edward lick it off her naked body, Bella decided to do as she was told. -ooo- One Year Later… Shielding her eyes from the sun with her arm, Bella looked up into a cloudless blue sky and yawned as she lazily reached for her sunglasses, realising lunch would be ready soon and Edward would be wondering where she was. Bored with watching him work on his laptop, she'd wandered out into the garden with a book and fallen asleep in the shade of the lemon trees, which had scattered her with leaves as she slept. Despite the shade, Bella felt slightly hot and sticky and she idly wondered if there was time for a quick dip in the pool before lunch. But deciding a swim could wait, she smiled at how lazy she had become and shut her eyes again, making herself more comfortable in the long grass and luxuriating in the breeze which had sprung up to cool her face. Suddenly hearing a low chuckle, she opened one eye and saw that, dressed only in his swimming shorts, Edward had silently crept up on her and was kneeling at her side, fanning her face with the straw hat she'd discarded halfway across the lawn. Grinning up at him but still too lazy to move, Bella teasingly ran one finger across his hip and over the hearts and flowers which covered her name, admiring the way her engagement and wedding rings sparkled in the sunlight, and wondering what she'd ever done to deserve to be this happy. Returning her smile, Edward bent and placed a gentle kiss on her lips and reached out to caress her rounded belly before taking her hand in his. With her free hand, Bella patted the grass beside her and watched as he lay down at her side, feeling the slight tingle of electricity she always felt at his merest touch, as he put a protective arm around her and she rested her head on his chest. After a few minutes, they resumed the conversation they'd been having earlier about baby names, but it seemed too much of an effort in the heat, and after all, there was still plenty of time to decide. Bella remembered again that lunch was waiting, but she felt too comfortable lying there peacefully with Edward's arms wrapped around her and as she moved slightly to look up into his eyes, a random question occurred to her, ""What would you have done if I hadn't accepted your job offer last summer?"" He laughed and squeezed her more tightly for a second. ""Sweetheart, you were mine from the moment I saw you."" Hosts Note: Please leave the author some love by leaving a review.

275,4,17,4-ControlPossessSeduceContest-17.txt,twilight,ControlPossessSeduceContest,"His touch as he traces the letters on my skin is light, teasing. ""Changed my mind."" ""Holy goddamn hell. It's perfect. Mise en place,"" he says, reading the culinary words scrawled above my heart. After placing a kiss on the tattoo, he tongues my nipple, breathing hotly against me. I try to pull his mouth back to mine, but he rears up and looks at me. ""It's gonna have to be hard and fast, baby. I can't fucking control it now."" Before I can answer, he's pulled the shirt off me. He sits back to lower his jeans and I lift my legs up to slide my underwear down. He practically rips them from my hand, tossing them carelessly to the side. Back between my legs, he doesn't hesitate, thrusting forward powerfully until he's buried deep. We move together wildly, exchanging no words. No promises. In his eyes, I recognize the hunger, the intensity that he always had for things he wanted. Knowing what he likes, I dig my nails into his back and trail them down to his ass, holding him tightly to me. He smirks conceitedly at me and angles his hips to hit my clit on each stroke. ""Oh, my God, Edward."" Squeezing my eyes shut, I explode around him again, and then I feel him release inside me. ""Fuck, Bella,"" he groans into my neck, letting his weight collapse on me. Hearts still hammering, we hold still, catching our breath. When he finally moves to lie on his stomach next to me, I immediately miss his warmth. Rolling to face him, I study his body in the faint light. In addition to the new tattoos on his arms, he has a random pattern of large and small inked stars on his side. My fingers itch to trace them, to try and make sense of the design. It feels too intimate, though. Too much like something a lover would do. That's not us anymore. Several minutes pass in silence before he speaks. ""I wasn't sure you'd come back from Paris."" My orgasmic high deflates like a leaky balloon, and I sigh quietly. This conversation is long overdue. I just don't know if either of us is prepared for it. ""It was a three-month stage, Edward,"" I answer, trying hard to keep the blame out of my voice. ""I was always coming home at the end."" ""How was it?"" ""Incredible."" It's true; I fell in love with the city, the food, the people. And the long, busy workdays helped keep my mind off my broken heart. ""I learned a lot."" ""You didn't learn not to work for assholes."" ""Working for James is good for my career,"" I assert. ""He's the best chef in Seattle."" ""Second best, now that I'm back in town."" He chuckles like it's a joke, but I know his ego. He's serious. And he's probably right. ""Are you back for good?"" I wait, breathless, not sure if I really want to know the answer. ""Yeah. I'm opening a restaurant. The Webers are the main investors."" Understanding, cold and callous, washes over me, and I bolt upright in bed. Feeling every bit as naked as I am, I grab the blanket on the end of the bed and pull it over myself. ""You had me cooking tonight for a rival restaurant ownership group?"" ""I was supposed to have James cooking tonight, but the chickenshit bastard sent you instead."" ""Because I'm better at working those events than he is."" ""I know that, baby."" ""Don't call me that,"" I demand angrily. ""You came back to town, fucked my career and then fucked me."" Realizing how upset I am, he sits up and eyes me cautiously. ""It's not like that, Bella. I didn't know you were in Seattle. And I never imagined you'd still be working for him."" ""At least he showed me that he had faith in me."" ""Is that what you think he was doing by sending you to Paris?"" Now he's pissed, too. ""He did that to drive a wedge between us – you and me."" ""And it worked. Because you didn't support me."" ""You chose him over me!"" His voice is loud, and he stands up, plucking his clothes from the floor where they've fallen. ""You fucking left."" ""You left first,"" I accuse, feeling tears threaten the back of my eyes. ""Only so I didn't have to watch you fucking walk away,"" he replies flatly, sliding his jeans up his legs and buttoning them. ""You need to go,"" I whisper, looking down so he can't see that I'm crying. ""On my way,"" he spits. At the bedroom doorway, he pauses. ""In spite of it all, how we hurt each other, we're both here. And we both know there's something between us that pulls us back together, even when we push each other away."" The words are spoken softly, but the impact on me is deafening. Still, I don't look up… and I don't reply. My right hand absently traces the letters printed on my chest. Mise en place. Everything in its place. My heart belongs right here where it's protected – not in the hands of someone I don't know if I can trust. I hear him leave the room, and a minute later leave my apartment. This time I'm the one who can't stand to watch the other walk away. Grabbing the Guinness t-shirt, I put it on and lie back. The t-shirt still doesn't smell like him. But the bed does.

276,4,9,4-ControlPossessSeduceContest-9.txt,twilight,ControlPossessSeduceContest,"long and arduous kiss from him, I realize that in my lust induced haze, he has somehow moved me to the bed so that now I'm lying on my back without a stitch of cloth on me. He doesn't look away from me as he undresses himself, letting me revel at the sight of him. Once all of his clothes are in a heap next to mine, he crawls up my body ... dropping kisses as he goes. He stops in his ascend when he reaches my stomach. As if on a whim, he drops a kiss on my left hipbone and then one on my right. Before I can realize where he's headed, his lips press just above my clit, making me gasp in surprise. That's when he looks up at me; lying between my legs with his face pressed to the most intimate part of my body, he looks at me with questioning eyes. ""Haven't been touched here for some time, have you?"" Closing my eyes, I shake my head. ""No,"" I answer. ""It's been quite some time."" ""Don't worry, sweetheart, I'm here now. I always take care of what's mine."" I don't get to respond to his words though because the next thing I know, his mouth is on me—kissing me, sucking me, licking me in all the ways he used to before he left me. He makes me climax with his fingers and mouth—the earth shattering, toe curling type of climax. Before I can fully come back down from my high, I feel him hot and hard at my entrance, stroking me with his cock, but never entering. ""Please,"" the word comes out of my mouth in a plea. Looking down, I see him running it along my pussy lips. Just a little bit more, I implore him in my mind. ""What, Bella?"" he asks me, his eyes on my face. ""What do you want?"" ""You."" My answer is effortless, almost like a reflexive action. ""Me?"" he scoffs. ""You had me, Bella, and then you didn't want me."" ""No ..."" He starts to shake his head, cutting me off yet again. ""Wrong answer, Ms. Swan. Try again."" I can't take it anymore and the words burst out of me. ""It's Cullen."" His eyebrows pull together in a frown. ""What?"" ""My name,"" I say, pulling on the bedsheets to cover myself as I sit up. ""It's not Swan. It's Cullen now."" ""What are you saying?"" ""What I'm saying is,"" I pause to take a deep breath and then utter the words I have dreamt of saying to him. ""I'm Isabella Cullen now. These last two years, I've lived as Isabella Cullen, widow of Captain Edward Cullen of the U.S. Navy."" ""You mean that …?"" A deep frown takes over his full lips then. ""Yes."" I respond with a nod. ""I'm yours, Edward. Always."" My whispered words seem to make him wake up from a haze, and suddenly, he's kissing me, pulling me to his chest and touching me wherever he can. My arms and legs lock around him as if trying to hold him to where he rightfully belongs—in my arms. He doesn't taunt me this time though. In a smooth stroke he enters me making me feel complete after two years of loneliness. As he moves in and out of me, our hands reach for each other, desperate to familiarize ourselves with our perfect counterparts. He buries his face in my hair and with each thrust murmurs something unintelligible. First, I think it's a groan of satisfaction, but then, as his breath quickens, the sound becomes louder, and I feel my heart clench at his words. He keeps up a string of murmurs of ""You're mine. My Bella. My wife. Mine. Mine. Mine,"" as he moves inside me, making love to me like a starving man has been served a banquet. Once we're spent and lying in each other's arms, he slowly pulls me away from his chest to look at me. ""Why did you leave our home, Bella?"" ""Because I thought you were dead."" Bitterness leaches out of my heart as I recall those horrible days of confusion and heartbreak. ""What could I do, Edward? Dad showed me a letter from the Navy saying that you ..."" I stop and shake my head, not wanting to utter those dreadful words ever again. ""... that you were MIA, and I couldn't live in that house without you. Everything in that place reminded me of you, Edward. So, tell me what did I do wrong?"" ""Why did you react that way when you saw me today?"" His question makes me look away from him, afraid that he'll think of me as a silly girl. ""Because it felt a lot like one of my usual nightmares,"" I mumble. ""I still dreamed about you every night."" The corners of his mouth pull down at my confession. ""You thought I was a nightmare?"" Shaking my head, I correct him. ""Not you, our circumstances. When I wake up every morning to find that you're gone, the dreams turn into nightmares."" He pulls me back to his chest, kissing me hard before saying, ""I'm not going anywhere, baby. I'll be right here with you. You're mine."" ""Forever,"" I promise. ~.~.~ Just before falling asleep in his arms, I feel Edward drop a kiss to my forehead, and he whispers, ""Charlie Swan, you tried to take away the girl I love. You better watch your back. Edward Cullen doesn't forgive easily."" Hosts Note: Please leave the author some love by leaving a review.

277,4,13,4-ControlPossessSeduceContest-13.txt,twilight,ControlPossessSeduceContest,"feeling proud that I was able to hold on when I was so close to the edge for so long. He stills and grips my hips, holding me as he empties himself inside of me. I latch onto his shoulder while I ride out the violent pulsations firing off all over my body. He buries his face in my neck as he twitches. ""Bella"" he groans. We lay like that with him still inside of me and after a while his breathing evens out and I know he's asleep. I stroke his hair until thoughts overwhelm me and I begin to cry. I let stream after stream of heavy tears flow down my face, until my eyes grow heavy and sleepy. I blink rapidly against the burn, trying to stay awake...trying to remember. The last thing I mutter before sleep overtakes me is the affirmation of my love for this man. Then with my last tear, I mumble, ""I don't want to forget you."" Time changes everything except something within us which is always surprised by change. Thomas Hardy She cannot change her circumstance, her major flaw, her disaster which has become her way of life. She cannot help that those dearest to her find solace and comfort in her prescence, whereas many of their faces she does not recognize. She cannot say that their faces bring her comfort. Not when time is constantly racing on and she is at a stand still. Not when her past is her constant and the future is unforeseeable. Not when her present is watered down by routine where plants of worry lie dormat until she is shaken by a reality too great to comprehend. She was in an accident but she is no accident. Her accident was no accident. Everything happens for a reason. I am forced to believe this. And she is forced to believe what she is told, what she has written down, what she feels in her gut. All signs point to me; a man that willingly put his future on hold to care for a woman living the same day on repeat. She asks, ""Where is the future in that reality? I cannot see it because it simply does not exist. Beyond today life does not exist for me. Beyond today you do not exist to me."" Beyond today I fight for her surrender and gain it by no hint of subtlety. The lengths I'd travel to make her mine and keep her that way are endless. Beyond today she is my love. She is in every nightly dream; every vision I see. Beyond today she is my life. Even if she never remembers me. This feels nice. A smile makes its way to my face as I grip the soft sheets beneath my fingertips. Did Alice buy new sheets for me? Thank you Alice! I turn in my bed and a beam of light strikes my closed lids. I squint, pissed by the intrusion. The light signifies morning and today is not a day to sleep in. If I'm late, Tanya will kill me. Yawning brings tears to my eyes. I blink them away and turn away from the blinding light. I guess I didn't close the curtains last night. My eyes rapidly blink and I become aware that I am not in my own bedroom. I jackknife up in the bed and rub my eyes, trying to get them to focus. I am completely awake now and physically shaken as my mind blanks with no recollection of how I got into this strange place. Weariness, followed by fear creeps up my spine, chilling me to the bone. How the hell did I get here? Wherever here is? Then I feel the bed move, and realize that I am not alone. There's a body next to me. I lift the comforter and my eyes widen. He's-oh god! He's naked. I had sex last night with a stranger. I can't see the man's face, only his shoulder blades because his face is turned away from me. Oh god! Oh god! Oh god! I broke my six- month dry spell and had a one-night stand with a complete stranger. From the looks of it, he's a very, very good looking stranger, but a stranger none the less. I slowly slide out of bed, careful not to stir him, but I fail. He turns in the bed and I get a good look at his face. He is...delicious. I get a better look and realize that I do know this man. I gasp loudly, and fall backward, gripping the covers in an attempt to break my fall. It only serves to prolong my fall and I tumble down the platform his bed is on and hit my head on the corner of his nightstand. ""Bella-"" I frantically call her name, grabbing her into my arms. She is stretched out...her eyes closed, her body rigid and still. Fuck! I startled her! This is my fucking fault. I never show her my face. Now I'm paying the price for my impatience. ""Bella baby, wake up!"" I shout over and over before laying her in the bed. There's no blood, but she appears to have been knocked out by her fall. I see her eyes flutter and her brows bunch up just as her hand flies up to touch her head where she is in pain. Her lips move a few times before she speaks, capturing my heart all over again.

278,4,20,4-ControlPossessSeduceContest-20.txt,twilight,ControlPossessSeduceContest,"that I have the same effect on her. There's an inch of skin where her shoulder meets her neck that had my attention all evening. Pale. Smooth. Begging to be licked. So I do. She tilts her head to the side, breathing my name as she does. I undo the buttons on the back of her dress, going much faster than she did with my shirt. As soon as they're free, she wiggles a little, the dress pooling at her feet. ""You were naked? This whole time?"" She turns, wrapping her arms around me as she faces me. ""Did I forget to mention that?"" ""Must've slipped your mind,"" I mumble against her lips. She smiles before giving in to the kiss. Gone are the tentative kisses from earlier. Need consumes us both, as hands wander, teeth nip, and tongues soothe. We tumble onto the bed in a tangle of limbs, and I end up beneath her, totally at her mercy as she straddles me. ""Bella—"" ""How about you let me lead for a while?"" Like she hasn't been in control since day one. She reaches between us, wrapping her hand around my cock. I sigh, closing my eyes as she strokes me slowly, knowing how to bring me to the edge without falling over it. She begins to rock over me, the movements in sync with her hand. I bite back a groan when I feel her pussy over me, already so wet. So ready. When my stomach begins to clench, my cock throbbing almost painfully with the need to come, I wrap my hand over hers, stopping her movements. She looks confused but only for a second. She smiles softly, licking her lips. She lifts her hips, and I love that we're thinking the same thing. More. As she takes me in inch by hard inch, she leans forward and holds out her hands. No words are needed; I know what she wants: our complete connection everywhere. I raise my hands, and she slowly threads our fingers together, squeezing gently as they completely connect with mine. We are now one — body and soul. We both know it. There's no going back. A vision above me, Bella moves with the confidence of a woman who knows what she likes and knows how to get it. The way she works me, uses my body for her needs, makes her even more beautiful to me. She leans back, and her chest thrusts out. Her mouth is slightly open as she breathes through her pleasure. Shadows dance across her body, making me want to follow them with my tongue. I can't take my eyes off her. Her hips quicken, the slow pace forgotten as the need to come takes over. She rests her hands on my legs and lets me take over. Lets me take control. I can feel every exquisite inch and the way she trembles; she's as close as I am. My hand slips between us, finding her clit with ease. She hisses, her thrusts turning into sharp movements. My hips meet hers — as she moves down, I thrust up — and her answering moan echoes throughout the suite. Whispered pleas and words of encouragement — harder, faster — fill the air. When it becomes too much for her, she flops forward, her chest against mine. Slick skin against slick skin, we move faster and faster until I feel her clenching tight around me. Everything becomes too much; her whimpers as I continue to move against her, the way she nips at my collarbone, and the slight tug of my hair have me coming hard only moments after her. We remain joined together until I can feel her shivering. I kiss her forehead softly. ""Get under the covers with me. Let's sleep."" We're apart for only the seconds it takes to surround ourselves with the duvet. As soon as we do, she's back in my arms, her leg thrown over mine. She looks up at me with a lazy smile, and I know this is it. She's it. *Number 12* The following morning, we sleep late. When I wake, Bella's already awake and facing me. Last night's makeup is smudged under her eyes, and her hair's styled in a mess that can only be described as sex hair, but she still manages to look gorgeous. ""We're going to miss afternoon tea if we don't leave soon."" I roll on my side, mirroring her position. ""About that."" ""What about it?"" ""What do you say to leaving early?"" She leans up on her elbows, hovering over me slightly. ""You want to leave?"" She frowns, and it occurs to me she thinks I want this weekend to be over, that I want what we've had this weekend to come to an end. The uncertainty is clear on her face, the silence awkward between us as we try to figure out where to go from here. ""I'm ready to leave my reunion, Bella. That's it. These people are my past. I thought I had something to prove to them."" I close the gap between us and place my hand on her hips. I'm distracted by her smooth skin but only for a moment. ""But you've shown me I don't."" I cup her face gently in my hands, kissing from her chin to her mouth. She remains still, but I can feel the beginning of a smile. ""You're my future, Bella. My Number 12 , and we're only getting started…"" *Number 12* Hosts Note: Please leave the author some love by leaving a review.

279,4,32,4-ControlPossessSeduceContest-32.txt,twilight,ControlPossessSeduceContest,"when I'm with him. He's addicting, intoxicating. He makes me feel safe, protected. He makes me feel owned. And what he did today, driving all the way down here in case we got bad news? My heart is so full it could burst. ""I'm scared, Edward,"" I say honestly. ""I know you are. I got scared too. That's why I didn't call you last week. When you left my office I realized I hadn't locked the door when you were in there with me."" He steps back, begins pacing again. ""Professor Hale turned up at my office door about two minutes after you left. I panicked when I realized how close we were to getting caught."" I swallow; it feels like ice slithering down my throat. Dread fills the pit of my stomach as I take in his words. ""Edward, I can't do this,"" I say. ""What about my thesis? How can you be unbiased? How can you be fair to me? Not to mention the fact if we get caught we'd both be ruined."" He shrugs. ""You've already fucking ruined me, Bella. I can't be without you now."" ""You can't be serious, Edward,"" I say, incredulous. ""I'm deadly fucking serious, Bella,"" he says with a humourless laugh. ""Anyway, that's why I didn't call. I needed to take a step back. Figure out a way around this. Get the best outcome for both of us."" ""The best... outcome?"" ""So we can be together,"" he says, like it's the most obvious thing in the world. ""Do you trust me, Bella?"" I nod. Despite everything, I know deep down that he's it for me. I have to choose to trust him. ""There are a couple of other positions I'm looking at at neighbouring colleges. I spoke to Professor Hale about taking over as your thesis advisor. Told her I hated your ideas and found you insufferable to work with."" He sighs. ""Of course, that's not true."" I smile through my tears. ""That's what I thought, at the start, you know. That you hated me."" ""Only because I wanted you so badly."" I'm exhausted suddenly. I slide down the bookshelf and sink to the floor. Edward sits down beside me, grabbing my hand and linking our fingers together. ""Tell me what you're thinking,"" he says. I sigh. ""I hate that we have to keep this a secret. I'm scared the pressure will be too much and we'll just end up hating each other."" ""Trust me, Bella. Please. We'll figure it out together. Keep your head down and work hard for a few more months and you'll be done."" Panic rises in my chest as I imagine it. I think of the pressure I've been under for the last few months with Charlie's illness. What if he relapses? What if my mother comes home and upsets things? What if I can't cope with my workload? I've been struggling to cope already. ""You can't live your life with what ifs, Isabella,"" he whispers. I gasp when I realize I've verbalized my thoughts. ""Please, Bella,"" he says. ""Be mine."" I pull my hand away from his and rise to my feet quickly, overwhelmed by my panic. It's too hot in here and I need a breath of cool air to calm me. My hands feel clammy and my stomach feels like lead. ""Bella wait, please,"" he says, but I'm already down the stairs, out the door. This feels so familiar. I'm always running from him. He's always chasing me. ""Please, don't go."" He pulls me into his arms and clings to me like I'm the last person on earth. He buries his nose in my hair, his lips tracing my jaw. ""Please,"" he rasps. ""Please."" He sucks my earlobe into his mouth and my resolve almost crumbles. My legs are like dead weights; I couldn't move even if I wanted to. My knees go weak as his kisses and nibbles trigger a slideshow of memories in my mind. The last time we were together plays across my vision, and I can't see anything but us. His kisses, his hands all over me. The way he teases me, brings me to the precipice of ecstasy before retreating, only to begin the torture all over again. The way my body would shudder when he finally sends me over the edge, with dirty whispers and sweet nothings in my ear. His is the sweetest kind of torture, the most luscious affliction. He fucks me so good, makes me burn so hot. He's everything I've ever desired and nothing I should dare to hope for. I've fallen hard for him, but I can't fathom how he could feel the same. I don't understand the intensity of these feelings I have for him. I'm so scared. Is he worth the risk? The answer is yes, absolutely. But that scares me even more. I'm so conflicted. ""Please, Edward. I can't do this anymore."" ""Do what?"" ""This. Us. I can't lie to you anymore, I can't lie to myself."" I try to pull away but he clings tighter. His eyes burn me. ""So don't lie. Stop fighting, dammit. You're mine."" ""I—"" He swallows my words with a kiss so tender, like warm honey on my tongue. My lips will never fit anyone else's they way they fit with his. It feels like home. ""You're mine. I love you,"" he whispers, before capturing my lips again. I succumb. I give in. I knew I would. Because I've always been his. ~The Professor~ Hosts Note: Please leave the author some love by leaving a review.

280,2,3,2-StarLight9-3.txt,lord-of-the-rings,StarLight9,"satisfied. ""Not let us try to return before our children and get ourselves out of those wet clothes."" As the two walked back, Thranduil was struck by a surprising thought. Both Glóin and he had suffered that day because of their pride and stubbornness. Perhaps Elves and Dwarves were not so different after all. oOo When Thranduil and Glóin had finally reached the halls, they were relieved to see that their sons had not yet returned from the hunting. The two changed in dry clothes and looked at each other critically. With a bit of luck the young ones would never learn about their misadventures. The healers cleaned all of the king's numerous cuts and redressed his arm wound, and now all of his injuries were hidden beneath his clothes and the bump on his head was hidden beneath his hair. The deception would work. Glóin and Thranduil sat in front of the fire to let their hair dry. Finally, Thranduil brushed his golden hair and started redoing his braids. The dwarf followed his example and started braiding his beard. As he did so, he was struck by a sudden thought. Elven warriors braided their long hair, and Dwarven warriors braided their long beards. For both it was a matter of honor and pride. Perhaps Elves and Dwarves were not so different after all. oOo Legolas and Gimli returned late after sunset. The elf was carrying two large rabbits, and the dwarf was walking next to him, talking animatedly. They could soon see that the King was waiting for them at the door. ""Welcome back, my son."" He walked forward and took the rabbits from his son's hands. ""Master Dwarf."" He nodded at Gimli. ""You have come home just in time for dinner. ""Good! I am starving!"" The dwarf cried and let the elf lead them to the table. Glóin was already seated and was waiting for the two young ones, eyeing the food impatiently. The company ate in silence until Glóin cleared his throat. ""This forest looks much better than the last time I visited it,"" he said, and Legolas wondered where the comment was leading. It could be nowhere good. It was just too civil to be true. ""I am glad you think so,"" Thranduil replied. ""The woods changed much after the Shadow was defeated."" ""You wood-elves must be very glad that darkness was defeated,"" Glóin said in between bites. ""Isn't everyone?"" The Elvenking asked cautiously. ""Yes, but it was especially good for you. I do not see how you were able to withstand so long. You seem to me quite incapable of dealing with your enemies. All prisoners you have held here that I know of have escaped."" He chuckled at the elf's raised eyebrows and at his son's and Legolas' horrified expressions. ""It is true! Gollum escaped, my companions and I escaped…"" ""Enough!"" Thranduil said firmly. ""You and your companions escaped because you were aided and not because of a flaw in my dungeons!"" ""Not a flaw in the dungeons,"" Glóin replied with a grin. ""But a flaw in your guards. And someone's love for good wine, naturally."" Thranduil was looking murderous, but the dwarf continued undisturbed. ""And the fact that we were aided speaks in our favor. It proves that dwarves are able to make good friends. One's strength is not determined just by muscles, battle skills, and brain, but also by a good heart and ability to make loyal friends and trusted allies. The fact that this remarkable hobbit helped us only shows that we have noble hearts and this is why he joined our side."" ""Noble hearts?"" The Elvenking shouted in disbelief. ""As far as I can recall, Mithrandir described your friend as 'a professional thief'."" Glóin jumped from his chair, glaring at the elf. ""Bilbo Baggins is much more than a thief!"" He cried. ""I am honored to call him my friend."" ""It is true,"" Thranduil admitted. ""I know this hobbit's worth, and you should indeed be honored to call him your friend. Why he decided to mingle with the likes of you is beyond me. But I wouldn't say that he was on your side. As far as I remember, he betrayed you."" ""He didn't!"" Glóin argued passionately ""He didn't betray us when he went to you. He was only trying to protect us from your greed."" ""Or from your own greed,"" the king suggested. Legolas did not like where this was going and stood up, prepared to intervene. Then suddenly he caught sight of something that made the breath hitch at his throat. It was a glimmer in Glóin's eyes. The same glimmer he had often seen in Gimli's eyes when he was bantering with his friend. And then he looked up to see the same glimmer reflected in his father's eyes as well. Legolas gazed at Gimli, as if looking for confirmation. Do you see the same that I am seeing, Elvellon? His stunned expression seemed to ask. Yes , Gimli's eyes seemed to answer. I see a friendly argument. Glóin and Thranduil continued shouting ay each other, but their sons could clearly see that it was devoid of the malice that had been present before. And they could only stare in wonder. ""Perhaps this was not such a bad idea after all,"" Gimli said softly. ""No,"" Legolas answered. ""Perhaps not."" Lost in their surprise, the two friends lost track of their father's conversation until Glóin's next words made them both jump in their seats. ""I will leave soon,"" the older dwarf was saying, ""but you are welcome to journey with me and visit Erebor."" Gimli and Legolas exchanged a shocked glance and froze in expectation. ""I would be very interested in seeing The Lonely Mountain,"" Thranduil replied. Gimli blinked. He winced as he imagined the proud and somewhat stubborn Elvenking surrounded by his kin. This could not end well. Legolas had paled. ""Or maybe I was wrong,"" he said with a guilty smile. ""Perhaps it was."" The End"
281,2,19,2-StarLight9-19.txt,lord-of-the-rings,StarLight9,"by saying that differences made them stronger. However, he decided that it would be safest to check what his son had learned. ""So, Eldarion, what is the moral of the story?"" He asked. ""The moral of the story,"" the young prince started and grinned mischievously, ""is that my father is a hero!"" He laughed and ran out of the room, leaving a stunned Aragorn staring after him. ""Do not worry, Estel."" A slender hand brushed through the King's dark locks. ""He understands. But tell me something, meleth nîn . Why did you leave out the last part of the story?"" ""It wasn't needed for the lesson,"" Aragorn answered. Nevertheless, his face brightened as he remembered the end of the tale. -x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x- After the bandits were captured and sent to their new residence, the dungeons of Mirkwood, the tournament continued as if nothing had happened. Of course, after a careful examination of Estel's wounds, Lord Elrond was horrified and didn't let him participate in any further events, much to the boy's displeasure. However, when it was over, Sadron and Meldiron came to their injured friend and told him everything they had done. Everyone went silent when King Thranduil walked to the middle of the glade. ""The Valour Contest this year was glorious as always,"" he said. ""Our children showed remarkable skills and we must all be proud of them. And now I wish to honor those who placed high above the others. These are young elves whose skills deserve great respect, and who will one day grow to be brave warriors and fierce defenders of their realms."" Everyone was listening intently. They didn't know the scores yet, and hoped that children from their realm would be awarded a place. ""The first place,"" Thranduil said and made a deliberate pause, ""is awarded to Nostalion of Lothlórien!"" Estel breathed a sigh of disappointment. He had hoped that one of his best friends, Sadron and Meldiron, would win. But still they could win a second or a third place, and he believed in them. A golden-haired child walked to Thranduil and bowed. The King smiled benevolently at the Valour Contest winner and handed him a pillow, decorated with blue and white flowers. On it laid an intricately ornamented elven knife and everyone gasped at the beauty of it. ""May you defend your realm with this, young one. Your parents will keep this knife and give it to you when you are the right age."" All elves stared at the King in expectation once again. It was time to announce the second place. ""The boy with the next highest score is a brave young elf who will one day become a great warrior,"" Thranduil said. Sadron, Sadron, Sadron , Estel repeated silently. His friends had told him that Sadron had done better than Meldiron, and he sincerely hoped that his friend would win the second place. ""The second place is awarded to Alagos of Lasgalen!"" Estel sighed once again. But there was also hope in his heart. Children from Lothlórien and Mirkwood had placed already; it was time for a child from Imladris. His realm had to be honored together with the rest. His family deserved this honor. All of his hopes died, however, as King Thranduil said his next words. ""The third place is awarded to the valorous Suiauthon of Lothlórien!"" The crowd cheered loudly, and the happiest cheers came from the Lothlórien elves. Two of their children had been honored and they were proud of that. Estel bent his head and gazed at the ground sadly. Imladris was the only realm that hadn't been honored. Not only was it not honored, it was put to shame by his own lack of skills. He was so lost in his dark thoughts, that he almost missed Thranduil's next words. ""This year I decided to give a special award to someone, who showed real courage outside the challenges."" All elves went silent once again at those words and froze in expectation. Estel raised his head, not sure what to think. Maybe a prize would be awarded to Imladris after all? Maybe Sadron's score had been so close to the third one that they had decided to honor him as well? But he was unprepared for what he heard. ""Estel of Imladris!"" Thranduil announced and for a fleeting moment his eyes locked with the boy's. ""Because sometimes we see real valor from the ones we least expect to have it."" The crowd erupted in loud cheers, but Estel didn't hear them. He only saw Elrond's face, happy and proud. And this was enough for him. -x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x- A little boy was sitting on the stairs, absently playing with a wooden toy-horse. His gaze fell on Lador and Vorion, who were preparing to go swimming, and he sighed sadly. ""Hey, Berehil!"" The child turned and froze in surprise and as he saw Eldarion rushing towards him. ""Do you want to go riding?"" The prince asked. The boy laughed and the two children rushed towards the stables. They were unaware of the two sets of gray eyes watching them from the window. ""I told you that he understands,"" Arwen said with a smile. ""Your son is clever, Estel. Like his father."" ""And his mother,"" Aragorn answered and returned the smile. ""But I still don't understand. If he knew what I wanted to tell him, then why did he say it?"" ""But what he said was the truth, meleth nîn ,"" Arwen said, sounding amused. ""He said that his father was a hero. And is it not so?"" She grinned at her husband's perplexed and slightly shocked face. ""I know what my father told you ninety years ago. And now I tell you the same."" She bent forward and kissed him lovingly. ""I will always be proud of you."" He returned the kiss and gazed affectionately at the two retreating children. His mother had been right. In spite of all the pain, something good had indeed come of it. THE END"
282,2,29,2-StarLight9-29.txt,lord-of-the-rings,StarLight9,"am not making an idle promise. Suddenly I see an orc running towards us, and I hear my own terrified scream. I grab Aragorn and run, not knowing where I am headed. My child is crying in my arms, but I have no time to comfort him, neither have I time to care about the burning pain in my shoulder. I see a tree and run towards it. I try to climb, but I cannot with the child in my arms. The orc is here. I stretch my arms up and place Aragorn on the highest branch I can reach. He is not crying anymore, only staring at me with huge, scared eyes. I turn and face the orc. Everything seems like a haze to me, and I cannot think clearly. All my moves are guided by pure instinct. The instinct of a lioness protecting her cub. My dagger goes through the orc's eye. Through his ugly little eye. But my blow is not strong enough to kill him and the blinded orc cries in rage. His only eye left glares at me with hatred and desire for revenge. I suddenly see him fall and Elladan rushes to my side. He is asking me questions, asking if I am wounded. But I do not hear him. I stretch my arms towards my trembling child, towards my little light. My shoulder screams at me, but I ignore it. I take him in my arms and he is not trembling anymore. He is safe. My hope is safe. This is all that matters. … Lord Elrond meets us and we are welcomed at the Last Homely House. My son is taken from me, and I am led to the healing wing for my shoulder blade has been broken indeed. Before I leave the Lord of Imladris puts a gentle hand on my forearm. ""You are safe here, my Lady,"" he says, his voice soft and soothing. But I can hide my emotions no more. Suddenly I bury my face in the elf lord's chest with a soft sob, not caring if it would seem inappropriate. But he understands. An arm is gently wrapped around me and I can hear his voice in my ear. ""He will find happiness here. But he must be kept safe. His true name will remain secret to hide him from the eyes of the Enemy."" We go silent. We both know what his new name will be. There is only one name that truly fits him. ""What will become of him?"" I manage to ask in between sobs. ""He has no father."" Lord Elrond pulls back, so that his grey eyes look into mine. ""I will be a father to him, Gilraen,"" he says softly. ""I promise."" … And now I look at my son, lying in his cradle, looking at me with those eyes so big, the color of the Sea on a stormy day. ""I like it hewe, nana!"" He blabbers. ""Ewohiw told me he will teach me to fight with a swowd!"" ""This was Elladan, Estel,"" I correct him. He has quickly grown used to his new name. I have quickly grown used to it as well. For it is not new to me. Aragorn has always been estel to me, even in the moments of darkest despair. I sing a lullaby and he falls asleep. I gaze at my son and even though my foresight is not as strong as my forefathers', I can clearly see images of his future. I see him grow into a man, proud and tall, just and valiant. I see him rise above all Men of our time. I see him suffer, and I see him smile. I see him fight for what he holds dear. I see him loved by his friends, and feared by his enemies, but respected by all. I see pain and I see glory. I see his future. But I am no part of it. He will grieve and laugh, he will fall and rise again. But I will not be there. I will not be there to comfort him in his sorrow, I will not be there to share his happiness. His eyes will always shine, grey and deep like the Sea on a stormy day. But they will shine for others. Not for me. I gently caress his dark hair. ""I wish I could walk your road with you, my son. I wish I could hold your hand and offer you my love in times of need. But I cannot. You will walk your path alone, my hope, and you will go where I cannot follow."" O nen i-Estel Edain, u -chebin estel anim . I gave Hope to the Dunedain, I have kept no hope for myself. His stirs in his sleep, and I hold his hand, afraid that he might be troubled by nightmares. But then a smile forms on his small lips, and I smile with him. He squeezes tightly my finger, and I try to pull it out of his little fist, but I cannot. He is so strong for a baby! My brave protector. Cool breeze blows through the window and dries away the tears that had rolled down my cheeks. I bent forward and kiss his brow. ""Sleep, Estel,"" I whisper, afraid that my heart will burst, overcome with emotion. ""You will always be my star when all other lights fade. You will always be my hope."" THE END As I said, this is VERY different from my other stories, and I'm not sure about it at all. Please, tell me what you think. To all readers of ""Faces of Darkness"": I am afraid you'll have to wait a bit more for the next chapter. I don't think I'll be able to write as often as I want those days. But, believe me, I will miss you more than you will miss the next chapter, so I'll do my best to finish it soon. 7"
283,2,28,2-StarLight9-28.txt,lord-of-the-rings,StarLight9,"and the long dark lashes contrasted sharply with the unnatural paleness of his face. His lips were partially open and had taken a slightly bluish tint. An angry bruise was beginning to form on one of his cheeks, but it seemed insignificant compared to the deep gash in his stomach. ""No!"" Legolas heard his own strangled scream. Let me not be too late! I cannot be too late! The Elf fell to his knees over the prone form, and immediately tore a piece of his tunic, pressing it against the stomach wound. Against the bleeding wound. Bleeding! Dead men didn't bleed. Estel was alive. Legolas gently examined the human's body for other injuries and dressed them with pieces of his clothes. They needed to be carefully cleaned once they returned to Imladris, but for now this would have to do. He suddenly froze as tired gray eyes fluttered open. ""Estel?"" He cradled the boy in his lap and pillowed his head on his arm. ""Estel, can you hear me?"" The human looked around confused and his gaze finally found the worried blue eyes rested on his face. ""Legolas?"" His voice was weak but audible. ""Are you alright?"" Legolas froze in shock and surprise. How could Estel ask if he was alright? And then he knew. The human wasn't asking just about the physical wounds. Are you alright so close to a Man? Can you live with the memories, with the ghosts that still haunt you? Legolas smiled brightly and pulled the human closer to him, bending his head forward and letting their foreheads touch. And for Estel this was enough of an answer. Gimli was surprised to see tears in his companion's eyes. ""Elf?"" He asked worriedly. ""Legolas? Did I say something wrong?"" ""No, Gimli,"" Legolas said softly and the Dwarf gasped. For the first time the Elf used his name to address him. ""You said exactly the right thing."" Legolas was away much among the Galadhrim, and after the first night he did not sleep with the other companions, though he returned to eat and talk with them. Often he took Gimli with him when he went abroad in the land, and the others wondered at this change. On the afternoon of the seventh day after they had arrived in Lothlórien, Legolas and Gimli had returned from a walk through the fair wood to dine with their companions. Aragorn suddenly pulled Legolas aside, and the Elf wondered at the smile on his friend's face. ""So he did it?"" The Man asked. ""Did what?"" The Elven brow furrowed in confusion. ""Gimli crossed the border you guarded so well. You let him do it. You let him walk the road to your heart."" Understanding shone in the azure orbs, and the Elf returned the smile. ""The road was not so hard to walk for it had been walked before by another mortal. By a Man who dared walk on the road not taken. He paved it for everyone who walked after him. He fought all the obstacles I had put there, and cleared the way for anyone who might follow. If it wasn't for that glorious Man, I would have never talked to Gimli at all."" ""Glorious?"" Aragorn smiled. ""If this is true, you must tell him that he is the best friend one could ever have."" ""I will,"" Legolas replied seriously. ""And it is the truth."" It was their last night in Lothlórien, and Legolas had decided to sleep with the rest of the Fellowship. However, sleep could not find him. Tomorrow they would leave, and, most probably, would face unforeseeable dangers. Possibly not all of them would come out of this adventure alive. But this was not what occupied his mind and gave him no rest. His gaze rested for a second on the four sleeping Hobbits. His heart had accepted them quite easily, but still it would have never happened if he hadn't been a friend to a mortal before. To this friendship he owed his warm feelings towards the Hobbits, feelings he knew were fully returned. His eyes then traveled to Boromir. True, he never felt particularly close to the human, but he respected the valorous Gondorian and trusted him. He would always fight with him, and, if need be, for him. Yet, a few decades ago he wouldn't have allowed such feelings towards a human. Next, his gaze moved to Gimli and he couldn't help the smile that graced his lips. This had been hard indeed. Hard to break the ice, and hard to cross the border. But he had done it, and for this he was glad. Finally, his eyes rested on the sleeping form of the Man, to whom he owed it all. He couldn't resist his urge and shook him slightly. ""Mmm?"" Heavy eyelids lifted slowly and an unfocused gray gaze turned towards the golden-haired being. ""I just wanted to tell you that you are the best friend one could ever have,"" Legolas whispered. ""I know that, Elf,"" Aragorn murmured sleepily. ""Can I go back to sleep now?"" He didn't wait for an answer and closed his eyes. Legolas shook his head in amusement. The smile on his lips was one of pure affection. Sapphire eyes took in the forms of the four Hobbits, the two Men, and the Dwarf. Years ago he had never thought he would ever find himself in such a company, but now he was prepared to fight for each one of them, to die for each one of them. Surprisingly even for him, he had allowed each one of those seven beings walk along the path that led to his heart. He had let them all cross the border he had placed to separate himself from the rest of the world. And they have all fought patiently to cross it. And they all deserved a place in his heart. ""Sleep well, my friends."" THE END Thanks for reading and I would love to hear what you think :-)"

""You cannot suggest that someone put the snake in the grass and hoped that Eldarion, or perhaps I myself, would stumble through there? Or are you saying someone is breeding the snakes and populating the forest with them to cause trouble? That would be too much work with little reward. Even if someone did bring the snake here, it is hard to believe that they had ill intent or that the incident would repeat."" ""And what other intent can there be in bringing a poisonous snake!"" Legolas argued. Aragorn looked at the guards, who were throwing them curious glances. ""Come to my study tomorrow morning. We shall talk about this then,"" he promised. Soon the woods were left behind and the White City rose ahead. The gates at each level opened as the King and his party rode up. A small group was waiting to meet them. ""Uncle Gimli, look!"" Eldarion cried. ""I did bring them back safely, as promised! But I had to pay for it with many battle wounds."" He proudly showed his bandaged foot. Arwen's eyes widened at this and she turned an inquisitive glare at her husband. ""Estel, I truly hope you have a good explanation for this."" ""It was not his fault this time, Arwen, I swear,"" Legolas protested, and the Queen's gaze turned at him. ""Stay out of this, Legolas,"" she warned him, and the King smiled. ""Yes, that would be wise, my friend. Forgive me, I need to spend time with my family now, but I shall see you tomorrow. Please take Frea and Algar to Nestabess and ask her to show them around. Legolas watched thoughtfully as the royal family disappeared inside. He hoped tomorrow would not be too late. -:- ""I need to leave you alone for a few minutes, Berion. Will you be well?"" Berion looked uncertainly at the older man. They were supposed to share guard duty at the first city wall, but these were peaceful times and a single guard was more than enough. Only, Berion had joined the guards a little more than a month ago and was still feeling uncertain. ""Of course, all will be well,"" he replied proudly. ""No need to hurry."" His companion smiled and patted him on the back before he walked away. Berion took in a deep breath of the fresh night air; the knowledge that now the safety of the City depended to a certain extend on him was making him lightheaded. It was exhilarating… and very much frightening. He was concentrated on what was happening beyond the city walls, and not within them, which is why it took him a while to notice the presence of another. Berion whirled around as he heard the approaching steps. A hooded figure was walking purposefully towards the gate, and even though the young man was more concerned about intruders coming in, than people going out, a lone traveller at this hour was certainly suspicious. ""Halt!"" he cried. ""State your name and your business!"" The hood fell down revealing a fair face, framed by long, fiery curls. ""My name is Frea. Forgive me, but I do not believe I know you. I am new to the City; I only moved here today. I work in the Houses of Healing now and was sent to gather herbs in the woods."" The young guard gaped at her. ""You and your brother are the ones who saved Prince Eldarion's life! My lady, Gondor is in your debt!"" Frea smiled, ""Thank you for the kind words, but they are undeserved. We did nothing more than anyone else would have done. But I have told you my name now, will you not tell me yours?"" ""I am Berion,"" he mumbled, trying not to blush. ""Forgive me, but why would you gather herbs in this hour?"" ""Some herbs are best gathered under moonlight,"" the girl replied. ""If you were a healer, you would know."" ""Of course. But I cannot let you wander the woods alone in the darkness. Allow me to accompany you once my companion returns."" She laughed. ""I have lived in these woods for many years; I will be safe."" Berion was not convinced. ""I am not sure the King will be happy with me if he hears I had left his son's saviour all alone outside the city gates in the middle of the night."" ""Who says the King needs to know?"" Frea said sweetly and leaned forward, kissing the guard on the cheek. ""Thank you, Berion."" Frea walked on, without giving him another chance to protest. Once she had disappeared into the trees, she gave out a shrill whistle. A moment later, a man appeared. He was tall, with dark hair and eyes and a stubbled, weather-beaten face. ""Frea, you are beaming like a lit torch,"" he said with a smirk. ""Should I assume that the news is good?"" ""More than good."" The girl grinned back. ""The King bought the entire story. Algar and I are well respected and trusted now and are allowed to move freely around the palace. He is truly a fool when his son's safety is concerned."" ""The Days of the King are numbered then,"" the stranger said satisfied. ""I admit I never doubted you, Frea, you are a sneaky little wench."" He reached out and tried to put an arm around her waist. The young woman angrily pushed his hand away. ""Mind your manners! I was called 'my lady' twice today, and once by the King himself. I would have you show me the same respect."" The man laughed. ""Come now Frea, we both know you are no lady!"" ""No, I am not,"" she conceded. ""Not yet."" The smile crept back to her face. ""But I will be, as soon as the rightful ruler is placed upon the throne. Send word to Captain Gulbrand. Tell him that the first part of our plan is accomplished. We are ready to move on.""

""This can be easily corrected. Come!"" The King and Prince ran outside and continued until they reached a muddy puddle. Aragorn dipped his hands into the filthy water, wetted his hair and tousled it. Then he took a handful of dust and applied a small amount to his hair and face, which gave him quite a rugged appearance. Finally, he took out some mud from the pond and covered his travel boots. At last he sat on the ground, stretched his long legs before him, and took out a long pipe from a pocket in his cloak. He smiled casually at his son and lit the pipe. ""Now, Eldarion, it is your turn."" The boy was gazing at his father in admiration. The complete transformation from the almost elven-like King of Gondor and Arnor to the rugged human had occurred in mere seconds. "" Ada , may I try pipe-weed?"" He asked. Aragorn shook his head. ""Your mother will hang me, drown me, and behead me if I let you do that. Besides, you are too young and it is not healthy."" The boy snorted unhappily, but his eyes brightened when he realized that it was now his turn to cover himself in dirt and grime. He grabbed a handful of mud, but to Aragorn's shock, instead of using it to cover his boots as the man had done, he spread a generous layer over his face. Eldarion laughed and started jumping into the puddle. ""Oh, ada , being a ranger is so fun!"" When the child was positively wet, he lay down and started rolling into the mud, laughing happily. The King's eyes widened in horror. ""My son, you were supposed to disguise yourself as a traveler, not as a pig!"" ""At least I certainly don't look like a prince now!"" Eldarion replied triumphantly and finally rose from the mud. ""Even nana wouldn't recognize me now!"" Aragorn eyed him critically. ""You look perfect. Ready to go?"" The boy nodded and after the King had run swiftly to the royal chambers to leave a brief note, they both went to the stables. They mounted two horses, not their usual ones since they wanted to travel incognito, and rode out, never noticing Arod and a magnificent black mare hidden in the shadows. Something else they failed to notice was the cloaked man following their every move. -:- ""My Lord!"" ""What is it, Pyasak?"" The man turned around and his dark eyes glimmered with impatience. ""The King! The King and his son! They both left the City! They are riding south now."" The Haradrim frowned. ""Where is he going? Is the birthday celebration cancelled then?"" ""I do not know, my Lord."" The man nodded. ""In this case we need to change the plan. Take all twenty men. We leave now."" ""Where are we going?"" Pyasak asked. ""We ride after them. And we will kill them."" -:- ""I will kill them!"" Legolas watched her with something akin to amusement. ""Come now, Arwen, no harm is done. Certainly there is no need to kill them."" ""You are right. I will not kill them. I will kill him ."" The golden-haired elf sighed. As it was, it seemed that his friend would be in trouble when he returned home. ""Are you sure? Perhaps it was Eldarion's idea."" ""I do not care who suggested this madness,"" she said firmly. ""Eldarion is but a child and cannot fully understand the risk he is taking. But Estel… ah! How could he ride out without his escort? How could he take my child out without protection?"" ""He had survived long years without any escort,"" Legolas tried to reason, but Arwen would have none of it. ""But he is a king now! And kings have enemies. And even if he is willing to put his life in danger, how could he endanger my son? Eldarion is helpless out there!"" Legolas grasped her shoulders and forced their eyes to meet. ""Arwen look at me. No one is helpless. Aragorn knows how to take care of himself and of your son. He loves Eldarion as much as he loves you. He will die before he lets anything happen to the boy."" Arwen closed her eyes and sat on the bed. ""That is what I fear,"" she whispered softly. Legolas gazed at her, slightly disturbed. He wondered briefly if it was foresight that made Arwen speak so, but then decided that it was only the worry of a mother and a wife. He knelt in front of her and touched her forearm. ""Arwen, nothing will happen. I am sure Aragorn knows what he is doing. They will arrive in Ithilien, my friends there will come up with some story to explain my absence, and they will ride back. The elves might even give them an escort on the way back here. They will return in no time and we will surprise him as we have planned. Agreed?"" Arwen forced a smile and nodded. ""I will send his escort after him,"" she said. He quickly shook his head. ""That will not help. He is far away now and your men won't reach him. Besides, he is far safer as it is. Sending the escort will tell everyone that the King is outside the City by himself. If we do not speak a word everyone will think he is still in Minas Tirith and he will be back before anyone has noticed."" Arwen sighed. ""You are right. I will follow your advice. Apparently you can think much more clearly then me right now."" But she didn't know that hours ago, someone had already discovered that the king has left. -:- TBC Thanks for reading and feedback is very welcome!

286,2,1,2-StarLight9-1.txt,lord-of-the-rings,StarLight9,"To his surprise, the bird remained silent. It only stood there, looking at him. And in the darkness Legolas had the strange feeling that the gull's eyes were a familiar shade of grey. And when the bird rose into the air and flew towards the forest, he could do nothing but follow. The gull landed on a stone on the ground and tilted its head in curiosity, looking at the man before her. Aragorn seemed completely unaware of the bird's presence, or of the elf coming after it for that matter. Legolas stopped in his tracks and gazed at his friend's figure, dark under the pale moonlight. The man was sitting on the grass, leaning his back against a tall oak tree. His knees were drawn up to his chest. His head was bowed, and his right hand was fisted in the raven-colored locks. His left hand was clutching the grass next to him so fiercely that his knuckles had turned white. His entire body seemed tense. Aragorn was completely unaware of his surroundings, and jumped startled as a hand was lightly placed on his hair. In a second he was on his feet and his hand was at the hilt of his sword. Legolas felt the blood freeze in his veins and his eyes clouded with guilt. He had left his friend so overwhelmed with grief that Aragorn had been unaware of the world around him. Even though he had put no effort in approaching the man quietly, on the contrary, he had tried to alert his friend of his presence, Aragorn had never sensed his coming. What if it had not been the elf who had first approached the human? What if it had been a foe instead? What if the man had been attacked? He would have been unable to sense the danger on time! Terrible images rushed unbidden through his mind. He saw his friend caught by surprise in a terrible assault, unable to offer any resistance. He saw Gimli trying to climb down the tree on his own with no one to help, falling and breaking his neck. He saw Aragorn falling under the knife of a foe he had not sensed in his grief. And he saw himself arriving in Valinor, smiling and content, unaware of what had happened and not caring anymore. He shook his head in denial. No, this had not happened and never would! Yes, he had left his friends in turmoil when he had sailed, but he had returned. The elf quickly placed his hand over Aragorn's arm, not only to calm his friend, but also to find some reassurance that none of his terrible visions had come true. ""It is me, mellon nîn ,"" he said softly. ""It is me."" Aragorn stared forward as if he was seeing a ghost. His expressive stormy eyes were wide and bright with shock and disbelief. Could he dare hope? Or was he seeing only what he wanted to see? ""Le-Legolas?!"" He whispered. Legolas smiled sadly and cupped the man's face in his hands, forcing their eyes to meet. He desperately wanted to assure his confused friend that he was real, he was here, and he was not going to leave. ""Yes, Aragorn, it is me,"" he said. ""I sailed, but I came back. And I will not leave you again."" The man was still at a loss. ""You came back?"" He asked fearfully, afraid that the vision might disappear and his hope might shatter to pieces. The fair being nodded. ""And you will not sail again?"" Another nod. Aragorn stared at him for another long moment, but then his features broke into a smile, and he felt tears of joy and relief roll down his cheeks. He pulled his friend into a warm embrace. ""Never do that again, elf!"" His voice, shaken with emotion, was partially muffled by the golden hair. Finally he pulled back and gazed at Legolas. ""Why?"" He asked in wonder. ""What made you come back? I know how much you ached to leave."" The elf smiled. 'Don't you know, my friend?' He though. 'You called me back. I listened to your call.' He was about to speak his thoughts aloud, but then it happened. The gull that had led him to Aragorn and that had until know watched the exchange silently, opened its beak. The wailing sound pierced the air, this sound so beautiful and so terrible and powerful at the same time. Legolas felt his breath hitch at his throat, and he instinctively stared west. His eyes bore a faraway look, and Aragorn was horrified to see a mixture of pain, confusion, and longing on the fair face. ""Legolas?"" He whispered worriedly. At the soft sound of his name the elf looked up. This whisper was laden with so much fear and so much care. He looked at Aragorn, and the sea-blue eyes were clear and untroubled. Yes, this worriedly spoken single word held more power than the cries of all the gulls in Arda. ""Worry not, my friend, I will not listen,"" he said. ""I still hear the Call of the Sea, yes. But I came back because I heard another Call. It bid me to come back and I obeyed for it was much stronger than the call of the Sea."" Aragorn frowned in sincere confusion. He had heard and read much about the Call of the Sea, and he knew what power it held over the fair folk. That something else was stronger was new to him. ""Whose call did you hear?"" He asked. ""What could be stronger than the Sea?"" The elf smiled. ""Friendship, Aragorn. Its Call is stronger than you can imagine."" The man nodded in sudden comprehension and a genuine smile graced his lips. For the first time he knew for certain that Legolas would not sail. The Sea held no power over him And indeed, against the strength of unbreakable bonds, even the Sea had to admit defeat. The End"

The best way you could have helped me help Aragorn was to get better yourself, which you did."" ""Hmm, you are right,"" the elf conceded. ""How noble of you, Gimli… Aragorn, do you know what I am thinking?"" He asked with a wink. ""I believe I do,"" the man replied. ""What?"" Gimli asked, feeling strangely worried. ""I find all this rather unfair,"" Legolas continued in a deceptively gentle voice. ""Unfair?"" The dwarf asked perplexed. ""What is unfair?"" ""You see, you helped me overcome the pain the sea-longing is causing me. You helped Aragorn escape his royal duties. And yet, no one has helped you heal."" ""Heal?"" Gimli was completely confused. ""Heal from what?"" ""Oh, but you surely need healing Gimli,"" Aragorn said. ""Healing from your desire to make cunning plans and to manipulate your poor unsuspecting friends."" ""No, no, I only wanted to help!"" Gimli cried and took a few steps back, as the man and the elf approached him with slow and deliberate steps. ""Do not be shy, Gimli, let us help you,"" Legolas said sweetly. ""You helped us heal. Now let us heal you. As you put it so well, sometimes healers need healing too."" ""No! No! Noooo!"" Gimli cried in horror as two pairs of arms grabbed him and threw him towards the lake. ""You fools!"" The dwarf shouted, splashing about and trying to stay on the surface. ""I cannot swim!"" Aragorn and Legolas exchanged a worried glance. ""He cannot swim!"" Instantly both of them jumped into the water, swimming towards the dwarf with fast, powerful strokes. By the time they reached Gimli, however, the dwarf had disappeared underwater. Legolas looked around in near panic and was about to dive and look for the dwarf, when suddenly Aragorn gave out a startled cry and disappeared under the surface as if he had been pulled down. The elf stared in horror. Was there some underwater creature that had captured his friends? He had left his knives on the shore and there was no time to go back! Before he could make up his mind on what to do, something grabbed his own leg and pulled him down. Legolas turned around under water and glared at the dwarf, who was grinning happily at him. After a brief fight he and Aragorn were free from the dwarf's strong grasp and the three friends swam towards the shore. For a long while they lay on the grass, soaking wet, trying to regain their breath. ""You said you could not swim!"" Legolas murmured accusingly. ""I lied,"" Gimli admitted. ""Oh, you should have seen your face under the water!"" The elf tried to glare at his friend but failed miserably as he dissolved into laughter. ""Thank you Gimli,"" he finally said and smiled affectionately. ""Thank you so much for all you did for me. I have not felt this good for a while."" He then turned to Aragorn. ""Thank you both,"" he added softly. ""I must thank you too, Gimli,"" Aragorn said. ""You helped me a lot. This trip did me a great good and I was a fool not to realize myself how much I needed this."" He looked at the elf, and noticed that he was frowning at him. ""What is it Legolas?"" ""What do you think it is?"" The elf replied in mock-offence. ""I thanked both of you, and now you are thanking only him!"" ""And why would I thank you?"" The man asked with a mischievous smile. ""I lost a cooking contest to you and suffered great humiliation, and then I was nearly killed by a falling dwarf because you decided to challenge Gimli on tree-climbing! You better have a good reason, elf!"" ""Oh, but I do!"" Legolas said. ""I helped you recover what you have lost. Remember, this thing so valuable to you that you wanted to get back?"" Aragorn laughed. ""You are right. Thank you for being happy again, Legolas."" They shared a smile. Gimli cleared his throat. ""And I must thank you both for throwing me into the lake. It was most entertaining!"" He grinned innocently at his friends' glares. ""Be careful, dwarf, or we might throw you again,"" Legolas warned. ""And now we know that you can swim."" Gimli decided that his best strategy would be to change the topic. ""I do not want to go back yet,"" he said. ""We are having a good time together, and I am sure that my kin in the Glittering Caves will manage well without me for a while."" ""I also think I could delay my return to Ithilien,"" Legolas agreed. ""It will be good to spend some more time together, just the three of us."" ""Aragorn?"" Two sets of round and hopeful eyes were turned towards the King. The man looked downwards. ""You know, I would have loved to stay longer, but now our task is accomplished, and I have duties in Minas Tirith, and-"" ""Aragorn!"" He sighed in defeat. ""As you wish, I am staying with you…"" The happy cries of his friends were contagious and Aragorn soon laughed with them. The tree rose up and walked towards the lake, letting their tired bodies relax in the water's gentle embrace. ""I saw that you can swim, Gimli,"" Legolas said. ""But can you swim faster than me?"" ""You bet I can, elf!"" The dwarf cried, and Aragorn jumped back to evade the wild splashing that followed. He could not help a smile. It was good to see that some things never changed. The End Thank you so much for reading! Comments are very welcome as usual. To everyone reading ""The Only Way to Kill the Dragon"": Unfortunately, I won't be able to write anything during the next two weeks, so don't expect chapter 13 too soon. However, I'm quite inspired by the next chapter, and can't wait to get the chance to sit down and write. It is called ""You Cannot Pass!"""

They will do it for different reasons – sympathy, a sense of what is right, desire to make a good impression, the need to feel like better people, and perhaps some of them would do it because of friendship. But what would happen if this same man had been very fortunate one day. He had made a successful hunt and had become even wealthier. I can tell you that fewer people would stand by him and truly share his joy than those who would have shared his sorrow. And would you be truly happy for him, or would you not wonder why he is the one who keeps being fortunate, and not you? Would you curse fate that it is not you who made than hunt? If you do not, and if you find true joy and forget your own hardships, then you are a real friend."" "" Ada , what does it mean to be powow?"" ""What it means to be poor?"" Lord Elrond sighed. ""I am afraid this question requires a lengthy answer as well, and I will leave it for tomorrow. Let us imagine something simpler then. You and your friend have a competition that matters a lot to you and he wins. Would you rejoice his victory or morn your loss?"" ""I would be happy for him,"" the boy said, without even taking a minute to think. ""Perhaps you would,"" the elf said with a smile. ""Yes, perhaps you would. And yet, this is easy to say and hard to do. Envy is a treacherous enemy which can hide inside your heart and slowly eat away what is good. It is more dangerous than anger or hatred, because it is sly and cunning. You might not even see it, but it hides in the shadows, ready to strike. Only when your heart holds no envy towards your friend, only then your friendship is real. Only then you will be able to forget your own troubles and your own pain and be happy simply because he is happy."" ~*~*~ Minas Tirith, 3019 T. A. The newly crowned king gazed sadly at the lone figure standing by the window. He desperately wanted to stretch his hand and lay it on the slender shoulder, to take away all the pain, to take it all and endure it himself. The pain that he had inflicted. Legolas had lost everything because of him. Never again would he feel joy and content in the embrace of a tall tree as he once had. Never again would he feel at home in Greenwood, or anywhere else on this side of the Sea. The elf had given up everything for him. How did he wish it was not so! Suddenly the elf turned around and Aragorn froze. The corners of Legolas's month were turned upwards in a warm smile, a smile that reached his eyes. Deep, blue-greyish eyes, filled with joy. Joy? What was there to be happy about? He had lost everything. ""You look happy,"" the man voiced his wonder before he could stop himself. What was the point of speaking about happiness now, now that Legolas had lost his own forever? Was this not digging into a painful wound? To his surprise, Legolas's smile brightened. ""How can I not be? Everything you have fought for has come to pass. The Enemy is defeated, you have taken your rightful place as a King of Men. Arwen will arrive soon and you can be together until the rest of your days. The question is, why are you not happy?"" Aragorn froze still and for a moment his worry about his friend's fate was forgotten. It was replaced by a new feeling, a stronger feeling. And then, suddenly the man pulled the startled elf into a fierce embrace. Legolas quickly returned it, although he could not comprehend what was happening in his friend's mind. And how could he? He did not know what Lord Elrond had said more than eighty years ago. ~*~*~ Rivendell, 2935 T. A. ""Only when your friend's own heart is breaking,"" the elf said, ""and yet he still has the strength to find joy in your happiness, only then, Estel, your friendship is real."" The child seemed frightened by the new knowledge. Being a friend was more than he had ever imagined. ""Will I find such a fend one day, ada ?"" He asked. ""Finding a true friend is hard, my son. You have to give a lot, and be prepared to accept what is given to you. But what you gain is worth the long road you need to walk. Your heart is noble and pure, and I believe that it will not be too hard for you to find true friends."" The child nodded solemnly, but something troubled him still. It seemed he needed to know something more, but did not know how to ask. ""Did I answer your question, Estel?"" Lord Elrond asked. ""You did, ada ,"" the child said softly. Yet, he made no move to leave. ""Do you have another question?"" The elf prompted. He knew his foster son well. The boy nodded, and he smiled. ""Then speak. I am here to help you find the answers you seek."" ""Lelas said we were fends,"" the boy murmured. ""Did he mean it?"" Lord Elrond stood up from his chair, and turned towards the garden, breathing in the fresh air. ""I fear I cannot answer your question, my son. Neither can you, and neither can Legolas. Only the tests of time will show. In the years ahead your friendship will face many obstacles. But if it will pass them successfully, only the future will show."" But as the elf turned around, so that the boy could not see his face, he smiled. For Lord Elrond possessed the gift of foresight. And he already knew the answer. ~*~ The End ~*~"
289,2,18,2-StarLight9-18.txt,lord-of-the-rings,StarLight9,"and was hoping that not many people would watch the scene. Unfortunately, a small crowd had already begun to gather. ""I saw you!"" The man repeated. ""You wanted my wife to take off her shirt!"" The elf vigorously shook his head. ""I certainly never wanted her to do such a thing!"" He protested. ""Silence!"" The angry husband cried. ""Did you not ask her to breastfeed this boy?"" ""I did, but I never-"" ""And how would she feed the boy without taking off her shirt?"" The man snapped. Legolas did not like where this was going. ""Then I suppose I wanted her to take it off, but only to-"" ""Silence!"" The man shouted again and turned towards the crowd. ""Did you hear that? He admitted his guilt! Shameless elf! I will complain to the King!"" Legolas gulped nervously. The last thing he needed was Aragorn to find out how exactly he was taking care of his son. The anger in the man's eyes had only grown. ""Perhaps elven women take off their shirts for every stranger,"" he hissed, ""but the women of Gondor know how to behave properly!"" The grin on his wife's face, however, and the glances she was throwing at Legolas suggested that she had never heard the meaning of 'proper behavior'. Her husband finally released the pale elf, who collapsed in a heap on the ground but managed to keep the baby unhurt. Eldarion had long ago stopped crying and was observing the scene with curiosity. He is memorizing it all and will tell Aragorn everything once he learns to talk, the elf thought in terror. The man glared at his wife, who seemed to be melting on the spot. ""Stop looking at him like that!"" He said angrily. ""And how should I look at him?"" The woman asked and sighed dreamily. ""He has much to look at – this silky golden hair, those bottomless eyes, this porcelain face – ah! I would say he is almost as handsome as our King!"" Legolas choked and almost dropped Eldarion. He had not wanted this woman's compliments because they made him feel uncomfortable and made him want to run as far away as possible, but now she had practically insulted him! How could she compare him to this former scruffy, muddy and greasy-haired ranger! Now this was an incident Aragorn had to learn nothing about! The man liked his wife's words not much more than Legolas did, and turned to shout something at her. The elf used the moment of inattention and sprinted away. As he left this horrible house behind him, he managed to glance at the sun. Fourteen more hours remained. Would he survive them? He was not so sure anymore… Hour 11: The good thing about this accident was that Eldarion had obviously forgotten his hunger and was now laughing happily. That was the only good thing. In fact, the child was not only laughing, but was also occasionally smirking and throwing Legolas conspiratorial winks much to the elf's horror. Legolas had reached a decision – he was not going to ask any more human women to feed Eldarion! He could easily get the milk of an animal, maybe a cow or a sheep, perhaps a goat. Now the elf realized that those animals would do best because they had milk all the time, while most others had only after giving birth. He should have thought of that earlier. Surely there had to be a herd of sheep or cows somewhere nearby and he would find one to milk. Legolas rode out of the city gates and looked at the Pelennor Fields in growing dismay. This was such a vast field! Why did no one use it to graze their stock here! Where could he find cows now? Legolas remembered that years ago a villager had told him that he preferred to graze his cows up the mountains. In this way the animals were forced to climb to reach the grass, and consequently they had less fat and more muscle, which resulted in better meat. His memory made him ride towards the White Mountains although he knew that he would have no time to reach them. There were lower hills and forests on the way, however, and he hoped to find his fortune there. The elf was worried that if they did not find any animals soon, it would get even harder after sunset. It was summer and the day was long, but still the sun was sinking lower and lower towards the ground. Thirteen hours remained until he was to hand Eldarion back to Aragorn. He had already survived almost half of his ordeal! Surely he would survive just thirteen more hours… Hour 12: For some time the elf had been suspecting that Eldarion had never been hungry at the first place and had been crying for some mysterious reason. The baby had stopped crying long ago and was now happily sucking his thumb and frequently giving Legolas' hair a strong pull. The elf grimaced as the little prince laughed merrily and showed him triumphantly how many golden hairs he had managed to separate from the fair head. Legolas sighed. Even if the child was not so hungry now, he would definitely need milk later, so it was better to continue their search. Besides, Minas Tirith was left far behind already, and the horse was taking them further into the wilds. And although the sun was going to set soon, its sight lifted Legolas' spirits. Only half a day remained! Surely he would survive twelve more hours… …even though if Legolas knew what was awaiting him, he would not be so sure at all. To be continued… Thanks for reading! I'll be away in a few days and the second and final part will be posted as soon as I come back. The next chapter of ""The Only Way to Kill the Dragon"" is almost finished and is coming soon. It is called ""Nightmare Come True""."

Estel had to suppress a cry as he fell down. He could catch a glimpse of what lay below. He could clearly see the ground and there were no branches on his way, nothing to stop his fall. Estel exhaled sharply as his back collided with something hard, forcefully pushing the air out of his lungs. The human blinked in surprise. He wasn't dead?! The fall to the ground was long, it would surely kill him! He tried to turn around and suddenly froze in terror. He was still on the tree! Estel tried to look around as carefully as possible. Apparently he had fallen on some branches way above the ground. But this was impossible! He was sure he had seen no branches on his way down. Had the tree moved?! He grinned slightly at the absurdity of this thought. Of course trees couldn't move. Besides, she had no reason to do it, she hated him. But what had happened then? Suddenly a wind blew past him and the leaves rustled softly. Be careful, young one! You could use those charming silver eyes of yours to watch where you put your feet! Estel gasped and blinked in surprise. Had he really heard that?! Had the tree just spoken to him? He swiftly climbed several branches up and sat down. Did you talk to me? Did you save me? He wished with all his heart that the tree would hear him, that she would understand him. But the only answer he received was the soft rustling of leaves, and he was unable to discern the words. Estel didn't know if he had really heard the words, or if it had been only his imagination, but the incident had a surprisingly calming effect on him. Whether the tree had spoken to him or not didn't matter. What mattered was what he felt. And he could feel that the tree most definitely didn't hate him and would never let him fall. The exhausted human rested his back on the trunk and drifted into deep sleep. The orcs were unprepared for what came upon them. Numerous elven arrows flew at them with deadly accuracy, each finding its mark. The fight was brief, and no elf received any major injuries. Legolas approached the tree and looked up. ""Estel, they are gone! You can come down now. Do you need help, mellon nîn ?"" There was no answer and the elves exchanged worried glances. ""Estel!"" Elladan shouted. ""Can you come down by yourself?"" Again no one answered, and the peredhel 's fear started to turn into panic. ""Estel! Answer me!"" He shouted almost frantically. If his brother wasn't on the tree, he must have climbed or fallen down. And down were the orcs. He didn't want to think about the implications of that. The three elves quickly scanned the ground for any signs of their friend's and brother's body, and sighed in relief. But still this silence scared them. After shouting several more times, Elladan was about to climb the tree. Suddenly a grinning human leapt lightly from the branch above. ""Oh, you are here already,"" he observed. Poor Estel was completely caught off guard when Elladan grabbed his tunic and lifted him in the air. ""You scared the life out of me! Why didn't you answer?"" ""You have been calling me?"" The young human seemed genuinely surprised. ""I'm sorry, I haven't heard you."" ""What!"" Elladan was incredulous. ""Estel, are you deaf! I'm sure they heard me even in Imladris!"" ""I'm not deaf,"" the man replied almost offended. ""I was only sleeping."" The older peredhel was so shocked by this reply, that he dropped his brother to the ground. ""You what?!"" Three voices asked at the same time. ""Estel, you cannot sleep on trees,"" Legolas pointed out. ""We all know how much you hate being on a tree."" ""What made you think so?"" The man lifted his eyebrows in surprise. ""My friend, I can assure you that you are wrong."" ""He is not himself,"" Elrohir murmured. ""Legolas, are you sure he didn't hit his head?"" The Prince of Mirkwood shrugged. ""I only know of his leg injury, but Estel likes to hide his wounds. A severe head injury wouldn't surprise me at all."" ""I don't know what has happened, but something is surely wrong with him,"" Elladan said. ""We must take him to ada immediately."" Estel found it quite amusing that they were talking as if he wasn't there. He realized what the source of their confusion was, and this amused him even more. ""We will go to ada , but I must do something first,"" he said suddenly, and before the elves could blink in shock, he had limped back to the tree, his hand placed on the trunk. "" Le hannon o gûr nîn! Le vellon nîn an-uir . I thank you from my heart! You are my friend forever. "" The two peredhil exchanged a horrified glance, now completely sure that their little brother was insane. Had the human just spoken to the tree? ""He must have injured his head,"" Elladan whispered. ""His mind is clearly not the same."" ""My mind didn't change, brother,"" Estel smiled. ""My heart did."" Legolas suddenly smiled knowingly. ""So you learned how to talk to trees at last?"" The human nodded. And then the wind blew once again, and the green leaves rustled. Estel grinned mischievously. ""She just asked me how a reasonable man like me could stand the company of three prissy elves,"" he said and quickly ducked to avoid the twins' packs flying at him. When he rose, he noticed that Legolas was still smiling. The elf whispered something which made the human blush and smile in return. I am proud of you. THE END Thanks for reading and reviews are appreciated, like always :) Note: The last chapter of ""Friendship is a Family Trait"" is coming very soon. 8"
291,2,10,2-StarLight9-10.txt,lord-of-the-rings,StarLight9,"someone was calling. The elf didn't know who or why, but it sounded desperate. He didn't know why, but the voice somehow filled his heart with sorrow. But it didn't matter now. He had almost reached it. Soon he could rest. Forever. "" Legolas!"" the voice called again. That name… He was sure he had heard it before. But it seemed so long ago. As if ages had passed. "" Lasto nin, mellon-nin! Echuio! Avo visto! Telo enni! Listen to me, my friend! Wake up! Don't wander! Come to me!"" Legolas could almost hear the tears in this voice. He was surprised to feel tears stinging his own eyes. Suddenly a hand grabbed his. ""Estel!"" All memories came back at once. "" Aphado nin!"" the boy whispered, hoping that the Noble Tongue would fight the shadows and bring them some light. ""Follow me!"" The two friends ran through the shadows, but their strength was coming to an end. All around them was darkness. Horrified, Estel realized he didn't know the way back. He had almost given up hope, when a sweet smell came to his senses. It seemed to dissipate the darkness around. The athelas… It was still boiling, showing their way. Estel's grip on Legolas' hand tightened. ""Noro,"" he whispered. ""Run!"" Legolas rose on his bed, gasping for air. He was feeling incredibly weak, but he felt that the darkness that had imprisoned him was gone. His gaze suddenly shifted to the unconscious form, prostrated next to his bed. ""Estel!"" he screamed in horror, gathering the boy in his arms. ""What have you done this time, foolish child,"" he whispered in fear. He wasn't aware of the way the healing process worked and was afraid that the boy had given up his life to save him. He knew very well that Estel would do it, which only added to his terror. The human slowly opened his eyes and forced a weak smile. ""You are back,"" he whispered before closing them again. OoOoOoO Everyone in the room was watching in awe as Aragorn knelt next to Faramir, trying to call the Steward back. They sensed that some great struggle was going on. Aragorn was calling the Captain, but his voice sounded more and more distant and far away, as if it was coming from somewhere else. Suddenly Bergil rushed into the room, carefully holding six leaves. ""It is kingsfoil, Sir, but not fresh, I fear. It must have been culled two weeks ago at the least. I hope it will serve, Sir?"" the fear in the servant's voice was evident. ""It will serve. The worst is now over. Stay and be comforted!"" Aragorn smiled in relief. It was true. The worst was indeed over. He had done it. OoOoOoO Estel opened his eyes and instantly closed them as a wave of pain passed through his head. ""Glad that you're awake, little brother,"" Elrohir smiled warmly. ""Of course he is glad,"" Elladan added with a grin. ""Now Father will have to punish you instead of us!"" Legolas chuckled. Estel felt his heart leap in joy as he heard his friend laugh. He was afraid he would never hear that sound again. ""Didn't you father tell you not to try this at home?"" the golden-haired being smiled. ""I'm serious, Estel,"" he quickly added. ""You shouldn't have done it. It was dangerous."" ""But I did it and it worked!"" the boy stated triumphantly. ""Of course it would work. After all I have extraordinary healing abilities."" The three elves exchanged a worried glance. How much did Estel know? Their doubts were not lost on the human. ""How did I get those abilities?"" he asked softly. ""Why was I able to cure Legolas when no one else could?"" Elladan swallowed hard. ""When you were very little, Ada blessed you. He wished that you would inherit his skills. And you did."" The explanation sounded obviously lame. Elves just couldn't lie. Elladan noticed the look of distrust on his little brother's face and tried again. ""You cured him because you wanted it very much. So strong was your will, that it managed to bring him back. He was lost, but your heart refused to accept it and fought to the end. This is what cured Legolas. You have the heart of a healer, Estel."" His words sounded much more persuasive now. Elladan wasn't lying anymore. This was the truth. OoOoOoO Faramir suddenly opened his eyes and stared at the man kneeling beside him. A light of understanding flashed through him mind. ""My lord, you called me. I come. What does the king command?"" he asked softly. ""King!"" Ioreth exclaimed. ""Did you hear that? What did I say? The hands of a healer, I said."" Aragorn smiled. Not the hands heal, he thought. It's the heart. He had learned this a long time ago. Éowyn and Merry were waiting for his cares, but he wasn't afraid anymore. He knew what to do. The healer looked through the window and breathed the fresh air. ""Hannon le, mellon-nin,"" he whispered. ""You are the one who taught me how to heal."" THE END Thank you for reading!

292,2,2,2-StarLight9-2.txt,lord-of-the-rings,StarLight9,"felt the familiar smell of rain. ""It hadn't stopped at all,"" Aragorn said unhappily, looking at the pouring water. ""We cannot escape both earth and water at the same time, remember?"" Legolas asked with a smile. ""We must choose now. If you want, we may wait here for the rain to stop."" Aragorn shook his head determinedly. ""I do now wish to spend a second more in that cave. Or in any cave for that matter."" ""Understandable."" Legolas nodded in approval. ""Now you know exactly how I feel."" Because of the rain it took them longer than it normally would to determine where they were, but soon enough they discovered that the clearing where they were supposed to meet with Gandalf wasn't too far away. Aragorn didn't even mind the mud anymore and even blessed the rain, pouring on their heads. It was comforting to feel the sky above you and breathe the fresh forest air. ""I am worried that we have made Gandalf wait for too long,"" he said, quickening his pace. ""Well, we had a good reason,"" Legolas pointed out. ""Being burying under ground and arriving on time don't usually go well together."" ""Then, please tell me, why did we choose the first?"" The ranger asked exasperated. Then he frowned in surprise and stared at the clearing they had just reached. It was as empty as they had left it. ""Gandalf isn't here,"" Legolas stated the obvious. ""Maybe he came, saw that we weren't here, and left,"" the man suggested. ""I see no sigh of anyone passing through here, but the rain has washed all tracks,"" the elf observed. ""Perhaps we should wait for a day or two more."" They sat in the mud and leaned their backs against a tree. ""Now we are facing both,"" Aragorn said. ""Water and earth. Water is pouring over us, and earth,"" he held up his palm filled with mud, ""is making us dirty."" ""Fortunately for you, human, you don't mind being dirty,"" Legolas said, faking a disgusted face. ""And, unfortunately for you, you do,"" the young man said with a smile and threw the handful of mud towards his fair friend. Legolas glared at him and was about to return the gesture, but the look on the ranger's face stopped him. ""Thank you,"" Aragorn said suddenly. The elf raised an eyebrow in surprise. ""In such a case you are supposed to say 'I am sorry,'"" he said dryly. ""No."" The man shook his head. ""I meant to say thank you for walking out of the tunnel with me."" Legolas smiled. ""Anytime, my friend. Although I have to admit that I am starting to regret it,"" he added mischievously and threw a handful of mud in the young human's direction, deftly ducking the one thrown at him. If the wizard had arrived at that point, he would have barely recognized the two covered in mud creatures to be his friends. On the next day the rain had finally stopped, and the two had washed from the mud and dried their clothes. The fire was burning merrily, the slender flames dancing before their eyes. Suddenly they heard a quiet travel song and jumped to their feet. A small cart was approaching, and in it they could see an elderly man with a grey cloak and a pointed hat. They exchanged an amused glance and grinned at each other. ""What took you so long?"" Aragorn asked when the wizard approached them. ""I am sorry, my friends,"" Gandalf murmured and his eyes took a faraway look, as if he was at another time and place. ""I was delayed."" The elf and the ranger exchanged a glance once again. ""You didn't expect him to say something decipherable, did you?"" Legolas asked with a smile. ""Not really,"" the man replied. ""But we were almost drowned in water, buried under the earth, faced lack of fire and air, and all he says is 'I was delayed'."" Gandalf sighed. ""Then I hope it will be enough to promise that it will never happen again,"" he said. The elf shrugged. ""I suppose this will have to do. One delay is alright, but do not make it a habit."" The wizard nodded in relief. ""Then you have my promise. I will never be delayed again."" sixty-five years later Gandalf was sitting on a chair, gazing at the sleeping hobbit. He still could not believe he had been late once again. And, just like the first time, someone he loved dearly had almost died because of his delay. Blue eyes suddenly fluttered opened. ""Where am I?"" Murmured Frodo, still half-asleep. The wizard gazed at the waking hobbit and smiled warmly. ""You are in the house of Elrond. And it is 10 o'clock in the morning, on October the 24th if you want to know."" ""Gandalf!"" ""Yes. I'm here"", the wizard said, looking greatly relieved. ""And you're lucky to be here too. A few more hours and you would have been beyond our aid. But you have some strength in you, my dear hobbit!"" Frodo frowned in confusion and looked at his friend. ""What happened Gandalf? Why didn't you meet us?"" ""Oh, I am sorry Frodo…. I was delayed."" A snort of disbelief made him turn around. Strider was standing in the corner, watching him with an annoyingly amused expression. ""I believe it is time for you to change your saying, my old friend."" ""My saying?"" The Istar asked surprised. ""Yes. 'A wizard is never late. Nor is he early. He arrives precisely when he means to.' You must change it to something more fitting."" ""And what should I change it to?"" Aragorn's smile broadened before he spoke. ""A wizard is never late. Except when he is delayed."" Gandalf blushed in a very un-maia-like manner and was about to retort, when Frodo's merry laughter made him smile. Perhaps his new line was fitting. Yes, it was fitting indeed. And now he truly hoped that he would never again be delayed. The End 10"

""Do you know what I think?"" Narin asked and didn't wait for an answer. ""I think this story about your rich family is nonsense. A piece of filth like you cannot have a rich family. We should have killed you from the very beginning."" He knelt and pressed his dagger at the helpless prisoner's throat. ""If I kill you now and throw your body into the river, no one will ever miss you. No one."" His blade moved forward, and scarlet droplets of blood flowed down the ranger's throat. Aragorn winced and closed his eyes. It seemed his family had been right. He was not ready to be a ranger after all if he could not escape this capture. Whatever the most important skill was, he clearly did not possess it. Suddenly Narin stopped and put his knife away. ""I give you a last chance, boy. I will come for you tomorrow, and if you are still unwilling to talk, I will feed the fish with your body,"" he said and walked away. Aragorn looked after him, slightly trembling from the cold. He could think of no plan to come out of this alive. A dark shadow slowly crept towards him, and the ranger's keen vision spotted it easily. A swift hand removed his gag, and a blade cut his ropes. Sirak's face appeared before him. ""Be quiet,"" the boy said. ""This is yours."" He handed back to him Elladan's knife. ""Will you take me away now?"" ""I cannot walk,"" the ranger whispered. ""My leg is broken."" The boy helped him rise and supported him. The two limped slowly forward. ""You know what you are doing, don't you?"" Aragorn asked. ""You know you are putting yourself in danger."" The boy nodded. ""Of course I do. I know the risks I am taking, but I have no doubts. You gave me something I have never had before."" ""What is it?"" The ranger asked in confusion. ""What did I give you?"" Sirak looked at him, and for the first time in his life a genuine smile graced his lips. ""Hope."" oOo Lord Elrond listened carefully to the tale his foster son was telling. When Aragorn finished, the ranger sighed tiredly and relaxed on the bed in the healing wing of Imladris. Elladan was staring at his twin in surprise. ""I cannot believe that you told him tracking was the most essential skill! It is much more important to know how to defend himself!"" ""Exactly!"" Legolas said. ""And he would defend himself much better if he could kill his foes before they have come anywhere near him. That is why archery is much more important than fighting with a knife!"" ""Archery didn't help him against the bandits!"" Elladan protested. ""Neither did his knife,"" Elrohir helpfully pointed out. The three younger elves continued arguing and Elrond and Gilraen exchanged a meaningful glance. ""Neither of the skills we taught him helped as much as something else,"" Aragorn's mother said. ""We all tried to teach him the skills that were most important to us,"" Elrond continued. ""But Estel found his own skill. His skill helped him escape, and he proved that he is ready to be a ranger."" Four sets of confused eyes stared at him, and he went on. ""His greatest skill is to be estel . To give hope. He gave the young bandit the hope that there was a better life, and this is the reason he is free now."" The three younger elves' gazes turned down guiltily. ""This was well done, little brother,"" Elladan said, his voice filled with pride and regret. ""I am sorry if the numerous lessons confused you, and I am glad that you managed to find your real strength in spite of that."" ""There is no need to apologize, gwador ,"" Aragorn said. ""I –"" "" You need to rest,"" Elrond suddenly interrupted him. ""You have many injuries, but, fortunately, I have exactly what you need."" The ranger suddenly paled. "" Ada , surely you don't mean to –"" Elrohir gasped as understanding hit him. "" Ada , you are not going to give him Your Special Tea, are you?"" His voice sounded horrified. Legolas looked at him almost pleadingly. ""Please, Lord Elrond, he is not that injured. There is no need for this. This… this is cruelty!"" Elrond shook his head in amusement. Elflings… The tea could not be that bad. Or could it? He poured a cup and handed it to his foster son. ""Drink it and do not complain! It is good for you."" While Elrond was preparing the drink, Elladan pulled his twin and his friend aside. ""We must track those bandits,"" he said. ""They need to be taught a lesson."" ""Certainly,"" Legolas answered angrily and his fingers traced the hilt of his knife. ""I have a few things to say to Narin."" The three younger elves turned back towards the bed. Aragorn took the cup and stared miserably at it. He looked up and found Elladan's sympathetic gaze. ""It was a pleasure knowing you, little brother,"" the older twin said dramatically. ""Elladan! How can you jest with his pain?"" Legolas asked. ""But I am not jesting, mellon nîn , I am completely serious."" The three elves laughed at that, making the poor ranger feel even more miserable. He lifted the cup to his lips and drank. It did taste like warg urine. My skill is useless for right now I can find no hope for myself. He thought as the terribly tasting liquid flowed down his throat. THE END That's it. What do you think? I wasn't really proud with it when I first wrote it, but now I decided to give it a chance. Thanks so much for reading! To everyone reading ""Faces of Darkness"": The next chapter is called ""Joy and Sorrow"" and is coming in a few days. 11"
294,2,5,2-StarLight9-5.txt,lord-of-the-rings,StarLight9,"of the beasts with my sword, but it kept its focus on Eldarion! I could not divert them!"" ""What sword?"" Aragorn asked sharply. ""I was not aware your father allowed you to carry your sword around."" The boy's eyes widened and he blushed, and the man sighed. This would have to wait. There were more pressing matters. And then a sudden realization made him stagger. Arwen reached out to steady him, but he slipped out of her hold, collapsed on a chair, and buried his face in his hands. ""Every single animal is enraged when wounded,"" he said. ""Fight or flee is the most primal survival instinct. If you hurt an animal, it would perceive that it is in danger and do one of two things – either run away, or attack its assailant. You hurt that dog, Baranir, and yet, it did neither. Instead, it ignored the one who presented the immediate threat, and focused its attention on Eldarion. These dogs have been specifically trained to attack my son. And this is not all – they were trained so well that they were ready to ignore their most basic instinct, to give up their own survival, only to follow this order."" Everyone held their breath as the implications sunk it. There was no doubt left that whatever had happened, had been directed against Eldarion. ""This tells us that we are dealing with an unusually skilled dog trainer,"" Arwen said. Aragorn stood up and started pacing. ""It matters not how skilful he is,"" he said. ""No one, no matter how talented, can train the dogs to attack Eldarion specifically, unless they have met him, or at least know his scent."" Arwen walked to him and placed a hand on his arm. ""What if they had something that belongs to Eldarion?"" she suggested. ""A piece of clothing perhaps, or a shoe? That would have taught the dogs his scent."" He nodded thoughtfully. ""That would have been enough. And I see no other possibility even though I am unwilling to believe it. Do you know what this means?"" Arwen paled and leaned in closer towards him. When she spoke, her voice was barely above a whisper. ""There is someone in the palace involved."" Aragorn put an arm around her shoulders and pulled her close. Then he turned towards the nanny. ""Moriel, can you tell me who has access to my son's possessions?"" ""I am afraid that too many people do, my lord,"" the girl said. ""All the maids that come to clean the room, the carpenter who came last week to fix Eldarion's bed, the servants responsible for the laundry-"" ""I see,"" the King said. ""I would ask you two, ladies, to go through Eldarion's possessions and see if anything is missing. You two would know them better than anyone. Then make a list of everything missing, try to find out when it disappeared and who might have taken it. In the meantime, I will go with Baranir to the place where Eldarion was attacked, and see what the guards have found. Even if they have arrived swiftly and my son is safe, we still need to get to the bottom of this to prevent further assaults."" ""You can count on us, your Majesty,"" Moriel said. ""I will come with you now,"" Arwen whispered tiredly and slowly leaned closer to her husband. ""I need to learn of my son's fate as soon as possible. I shall help Moriel when I return."" Aragorn smiled gently. ""I had expected nothing else. Come, let us go now for I am anxious for our child. I will prepare some supplies first. If what I fear has come to pass, I might have to spend some days away from the City. Moriel, could you send someone to entertain Lord Ghasaan for the time being? I will give additional orders concerning him as soon as I learn of Eldarion's fate."" ""My Lord! Wait!"" Baranir suddenly cried. ""There is something I forgot to tell you!"" The King and Queen whirled around and started at him. ""What is it, my boy?"" Aragorn asked. ""There was music in the forest, a strange melody, as if played on a pipe. We heard it right before the dogs attacked, and it continued until after we left."" Arwen looked confused, but Aragorn nodded as if some things had become clearer all of a sudden. ""I am grateful that you remembered that in time, Baranir. It might play a role more significant than you expect."" With those words he turned around and walked towards his champers, but paused only to take his pack and then quickly left. When he returned, his pack was empty no longer. Then the King took off the intricate attire meant for formal meetings and put on his travel clothes. In a minute, Arwen entered, carrying bread and a full waterskin. She took a glimpse of what was inside her husband's pack, and frowned in confusion. ""Estel?"" He looked at her and his heart seemed to break. She looked so frightened and lost, so desperate and disconcerted, and he tried to show all of his confidence and determination in his gaze. ""I know what I am doing, dearest. Do you not trust me?"" She looked from the strange object in the pack, the meaning of which she could not comprehend, to those grey eyes, which were always filled with love and care when they were turned towards her. But there was something more in that silver gaze this time. There was a steely resolve that she had seen only on rare occasions, and yet she knew that every time her beloved wore that look, everything would end well because he would never give up until it did. ""I trust you."" TBC Thanks for reading! You already have enough information to start guessing what happened, so guesses are welcome!

295,2,12,2-StarLight9-12.txt,lord-of-the-rings,StarLight9,"I had never fallen into that abyss? I would have remained Gandalf the Grey. My power would not have been enough to help Théoden King fight Saruman. He would have remained lost in darkness, and we would have been deprived of Rohan's help in the War. The War would have been lost. Middle-earth would have fallen into darkness. Now Pippin, you say that it is your rock that had caused my fall into the abyss. If this is correct, it would mean that your foolish stone has saved Middle-earth. Does that sound likely to you?"" ""But Gandalf, this is unthinkable!"" Pippin agreed. ""Of course this is not possible!"" ""It is precisely as unthinkable as your theory that your stone has caused my death,"" the Wizard said. ""Can you not see that?"" The Hobbit was thoughtful for a moment, and then slowly nodded. ""You are right, Gandalf. I am sorry. It was foolish to assume that my actions could have such a great impact."" ""All is well, my boy,"" Gandalf said with a gentle smile. ""You have a good heart and it gave you more grief that you deserved. But why do you linger here? Is it not time for second breakfast?"" ""It is!"" The Hobbit agreed readily. ""I will leave you now, Gandalf. Please, call me if Frodo awakes."" Suddenly he frowned in thought and his gaze met the Wizard's. ""Gandalf?"" ""Yes, my lad?"" ""Do you think that... maybe... perhaps... it might be possible that my rock has saved Middle-earth?"" The Wizard laughed. ""I would say this is highly unlikely."" ""I know, but yet... still... maybe it is not impossible."" "" Very highly unlikely,"" Gandalf amended. ""Still, not impossible!"" Pippin said happily. Then he turned around and disappeared among the tents, humming 'I saved Middle-earth, I saved Middle-earth' with a strange melody. Gandalf shook his head in amusement and walked back, quietly entering Frodo's tent. His gaze moved from the sleeping Hobbit to the man sitting on the edge of the bed. ""Let the lad have some joy,"" Aragorn said with a sad smile. ""Your supposed death and his belief that it had been his doing caused him much pain. More than he could bear."" ""A Hobbit's heart is big,"" the Wizard said. ""It carries great capacity for joy and sorrow."" ""And yet, the pain of killing a friend could be too much for anyone."" Gandalf looked at him carefully. ""And how would you know this, Aragorn?"" The Ranger, who would very soon become a King, shrugged. ""It is not difficult to imagine."" The Wizard shook his head slightly. ""So it has nothing to do with a long-past experience in Mirkwood, involving spiders and poison?"" Aragorn paled. ""How do you know this?"" ""Legolas told me everything when I passed through Mirkwood not long after it happened. He was worried."" ""Then his worries had been in vain,"" Aragorn said. ""I recovered quickly."" ""Did you really?"" Gandalf asked, his voice not completely devoid of doubt. The man sighed. ""One never completely recovers from a murder, Gandalf. I have killed many men in my life, and this had never stopped haunting me. While I was serving Gondor, I often led attacks against the Corsairs. How many lives have I destroyed, how many families have I broken!"" Aragorn stood up and started pacing around the bed. ""I did it to protect Gondor, to serve my people. We always labelled the Corsairs as 'evil', as 'a thread'. And yet, surely many of them had wives and children, mothers and fathers, waiting for them to return. Who am I to decide that the children of Gondor had more right to have their fathers return safely home then those poor children in Umbar? I know that it was the Corsairs who threatened the peace and our safety, I know that what I did was right, but still I will never forget any of those deaths. I had killed many times – many, many times. I believed I was used to it and would be able to deal with anything. Yet, when I believed that my foolish actions had led to Legolas's death, the pain was so much stronger. To kill a friend is different from killing an enemy. I later realized that I was not responsible for what happened, but at the time I was not thinking clearly and the truth was hard to see. I believe it was the same with Pippin. I was greatly worried about him, and I hope he will recover."" ""Pippin is stronger than he seems,"" Gandalf said, sounding certain of his words. ""He will recover."" His gaze then moved to the tent's entrance, where Gimli had just appeared. The Dwarf looked at the sleeping Hobbit in concern, a frown marring his brow. ""Frodo is recovering, Gimli,"" the Wizard said. ""Good,"" the Dwarf replied with a quick nod. ""I am glad."" But his frown did not go away. It seemed as if he was angry at something, but what could anger the noble being now that the War was over? ""What is the matter, Master Dwarf?"" Aragorn asked. ""It is the darn Hobbit!"" Gimli suddenly snapped. ""If he does not stop singing 'I saved Middle-earth' any time soon, he will have to talk to my axe! This is torture! It is even worse than Legolas's songs!"" ""Is that so?"" Aragorn's eyes were wide in mock horror. ""This says a lot, friend Gimli!"" ""Of course it does!"" The Dwarf agreed readily. ""I am glad that someone finally agrees with me! I have always known that you are a sensible lad, Aragorn!"" He declared happily and left the tent, murmuring that the Elf should hear that. Gandalf and Aragorn exchanged a glance. ""I believe Pippin has recovered completely,"" the Ranger said. ""True,"" Gandalf said, his smile brighter than the dawn. ""I believe he has."" -:-: -:- The End -:-:-:- Thank you so much for reading!

""Good,"" he said. ""A long road is ahead of us, and we shall speak of this again once we reach the great river and the Corsairs are taken care of. Come then, my friend, I fear it is time to leave."" Legolas nodded, satisfied that the danger was gone for the time being. Yet, as he jumped down, he felt Aragorn's light touch on his shoulder. ""I am here,"" the Man whispered, ""and you can tell me anything, at any time. Never forget that."" The Elf felt treacherous tears prick at his eyes, and at that moment he wanted nothing more than simply rest his head against his friend's shoulder and tell him everything. Tell him how afraid he was and how he did not want to go to the shore, but how he did not want to part from him either. He wanted Aragorn to tell him what to do, to make the choice instead of him, for he had no strength to make it himself and face the consequences. Still, Legolas knew that this was wrong. Aragorn had made much harder choices already, and he could spare his friend at least that. He knew that if he allowed the weakness to take hold of him now, he would always regret it. And he was silent. Aragorn held his gaze for a while and turned back, exiting the door and disappearing into the dark corridor. Legolas fought against his urge to call him back, and instead hastened to catch up with the Man. The two walked side by side, but neither spoke. As they entered the hall, the rest of the company had finished their meals and were ready to depart. The riders quickly mounted their steeds and set forth, reaching Dunharrow as darkness fell. Lady Éowyn greeted them and was glad to see such mighty warriors and to hear news of the battle at Helm's Deep. But as soon as Aragorn spoke of their path, she was horrified and begged him to turn back and fight with her brother and uncle. Aragorn and his companions had expected this for the Paths of the Dead seemed to awaken deep fears in the hearts of Men. After the meal everyone thanked the Lady for her care and retired to rest for the night. Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli walked to the booth which was appointed to them, but as the Elf and the Dwarf walked in, Aragorn heard the Lady Éowyn call out his name, and remained outside to speak to her. Legolas took off his boots and quickly changed into his night tunic and lay on the bed. He could clearly hear Aragorn and Éowyn talking, but did his best to tune out their conversation. It was not hard to notice that the talk was not meant for his ears, and yet his hearing was sharp and he could not help picking up words and phrases. Éowyn wanted to join the Grey Company and walk the Paths of the Dead even thought she believed that nothing but death awaited her there. At first Legolas thought it was madness, but then he realized that she was not much different from him. For he also wanted to walk the Paths even though he knew for sure that a fate worse than death awaited him. Aragorn was trying to dissuade her, and Legolas felt a strange pain in his heart. For the briefest moment he wished that his friend would try to dissuade him as well, would order him to stay back and give him no choice but obey. But the moment was quickly gone. He knew that staying behind would be a torture, and he could not bear the thought of Aragorn walking into that world of shadows without him. Aragorn was now telling Éowyn that she had no errand in the south, and Legolas desperately pressed his palms against his ears, after making sure that Gimli was not looking at him. This was not meant for him to hear! Éowyn was baring her soul, and the Elf was certain that the proud lady did not wish him to witness any of this. Yet, he still heard her next words, and they shook him deeply. "" Neither have those others who go with thee,"" Éowyn was saying. ""They go only because they would not be parted from thee – because they love thee."" And then, for the first time, Legolas knew that Éowyn's pain was greater than his own. Yes, now he knew that if the Sea-longing was a fate worse than death, then there was a fate worse than the Sea-longing. Éowyn wanted to go with Aragorn despite the dangers because her heart told her so. Yet, she was forbidden to go. And Legolas knew that if he had been forbidden to go with his friend, he would have been unable to bear it. The pain of being forced to stay behind, while knowing that his friend was facing the shadows alone, was worse than the pain any Sea-longing could cause. Legolas's heart felt lighter than it had been in the past days. His choice was made, and now he knew that it was the only right one. He would go through the Paths of the Dead and meet his doom. Why? He smiled, remembering Éowyn's last words. The Lady had known him for such a short time, and yet she had already seen the true reason behind what he was doing. Many paths have been decided in the past few days. Gandalf's path was to ride to Minas Tirith and warn the Steward. Théoden's path was to gather his men and aid Gondor. Aragorn's path was to reach the River Anduin and defeat the Corsairs. And his own path... His path was with Aragorn, wherever it would take him. ~*~ The End ~*~"

All hobbits were able to move very quietly, but this one possessed the rare ability to be completely unseen. He slipped his hand into his pocket, quickly finding the small cold object. As he entered the camp, he put the One Ring on his index finger and disappeared from sight. The hobbit looked around. Orcs were lying next to one other, and he had to be very careful not to step on any of them. He immediately spotted the orc Aragorn had shown him and smiled. This arrogant young ranger would soon learn the value of hobbits. Bilbo crept silently beside the orc and carefully put his hand in the sleeping creature's pocket. The ring was there. He took it out and gaped in shock. He had seen this ring before. The two serpents were staring at him with their emerald eyes. One devouring, the other crowned with golden flowers. The hobbit remembered where he had seen that ring. In Rivendell, in a very, very old book. This was not possible! This would mean that the ranger was… He didn't even dare think about it. Bilbo shook his head in utter surprise. Suddenly everything started to make sense. If this was true, and this was indeed the ring he had seen in the book, then he could see why the Dùnadan kept his real name a secret. The secret was great indeed. He had to know if this was true. He had to go back to Rivendell and check. Aragorn was watching intently the orc camp. Bilbo was nowhere to be seen. What was the hobbit waiting for? Did he get scared? Did he give up? ""Dùnadan,"" someone called behind him and he turned back. The hobbit was there, slightly pale but unharmed. So he had really given up. Aragorn sighed with relief. Maybe it was better that way. ""I have your ring,"" the hobbit smiled and took the ring of Barahir out of his pocket. Aragorn stared in disbelief. ""How did you do it? I was watching the camp the entire time and I didn't see you! You… you just weren't there! You weren't, I can swear!"" Bilbo's smile broadened. ""Well, obviously I was."" The ranger took his ring and examined it carefully in his hand. ""How did you do it? Please tell me."" ""I think Gandalf already answered your question. Didn't he tell you that there is more in a hobbit than meets the eye?"" Bilbo winked at the ranger. ""This is true not only of hobbits, Dùnadan."" He added cryptically, still looking at the human. Aragorn had no idea what the hobbit meant by the last sentence, it was obvious that the little creature had spent too much time with Gandalf. Strider was already used to the way the wizard spoke in riddles and had given up trying to decipher them. When they returned to their friends, the ranger was quite surprised to see that Gandalf and Legolas had actually expected Bilbo to succeed. ""I hope this changes your opinion of hobbits,"" the wizard told him, and the man just nodded. ""Well, Bilbo and I are going back to the Shire,"" he continued. ""You can join us. Then you can learn more about hobbits if you are interested."" ""Actually, Gandalf, I'm not retuning to the Shire yet,"" Bilbo said unexpectedly. ""I need to go back to Rivendell."" ""But we just left Rivendell,"" the wizard pointed out. ""I know. But I need to go back. Something happened. I need to check something. It's important."" Aragorn and Legolas exchanged a confused glance, but Gandalf nodded in understanding. He seemed to guess something they didn't. ""Very well then,"" the wizard said. ""But I must warn you, Bilbo. Be careful with what you find out!"" ""I will, my old friend. I know what this means."" ""I know that you do, Bilbo,"" Gandalf smiled affectionately. ""You always do."" o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o ""It cannot be!"" Aragorn repeated, still staring at the sheet. ""May I?"" Gandalf held his hand with a smile. The ranger handed him the letter, his arm slightly shaking. The wizard's smile widened as his eyes went through the lines: All that is gold does not glitter, Not all those who wander are lost; The old that is strong does not wither, Deep roots are not reached by the frost. From the ashes a fire shall be woken, A light from the shadows shall spring; Renewed shall be the blade that was broken, The crownless again shall be king. Bilbo Baggins ""This is actually better than what I expected,"" the wizard laughed. ""You should be flattered, Bilbo is really talented, but this is one of his best poems."" ""But how does he know?"" Aragorn asked incredulously. A sudden suspicion came to his mind. ""Gandalf, did you tell him something?"" ""Not a word,"" the wizard replied. ""He discovered it all by himself. He had read the ancient books and knows the legends."" ""Do you think the secret is safe with him?"" the ranger was worried. ""Of course. I trust Bilbo like I trust myself. He knows very well what this means and how important it is to remain secret until the time has come."" ""I never expected him to guess,"" Aragorn muttered. ""So few people know the history. How could he know something that even some Elves have forgotten?"" ""I think I answered this a long time ago. When you first met him."" The ranger nodded as he remembered the wizard's words. ""You were right Gandalf,"" he said. ""There is more in Bilbo than meets the eye."" Many years later four other hobbits would prove him that this was true about their entire race.

298,2,6,2-StarLight9-6.txt,lord-of-the-rings,StarLight9,"Who was she? There were no golden-haired maidens in Gondor. The vision dissolved, turning back into darkness and shadows, and Faramir turned his wide eyes to the one who had revealed the wondrous scene to him. ""What was that?"" he asked in disbelief. ""Was that my family?"" "" It could be,"" the man replied. ""Perhaps this is what will come to pass if we win the war against the darkness. And if you choose to face the pain and return to us."" There were such warmth and care in this voice that it hurt. Faramir had never heard anyone speak to him in such a manner since the day when Boromir had left for Imladris, never to return again. "" Why do you show me such kindness, my lord, when I have done nothing to deserve it?"" he asked in wonder. The stranger smiled softly. ""I have lived many years and traveled many lands. I have met many men, elves, dwarves, and halflings. And few, very few of them, deserve more kindness than you do, Faramir."" Faramir felt a lump form in his throat. ""How did you find me, my lord? How did you know that I needed you?"" The man grasped his hand once again. ""I heard your plea for help. And I followed your call."" "" A plea for help?"" Faramir was confused. ""I have never called for help."" "" Oh, but you did, my friend,"" the stranger replied softly. ""You called 'Find me'. It was a desperate call, and so full of grief, that my heart broke and I had to follow."" Faramir froze. He was not aware that he had called. He was not aware that he had wanted to be found anymore. He had believed that he wanted to remain lost in the sea of darkness and despair. But it seemed that his heart had known better. And now, he was found. He was saved. By a stranger, who had shown him more care and kindness than he had ever hoped to see again. ""Who are you, my lord?"" he repeated his first question, which had still remained unanswered. The man smiled gently. ""Look at me, Faramir. Look at me, see me, and know me."" With one swift movement, he removed his hood, revealing his face. A handsome, noble face, young and ancient at the same time. His grey eyes were sparkling and full of life, like the eyes of a youth, and yet wise and bottomless as if he had seen many decades and learned from them. There were warmth and compassion in those eyes, and Faramir had never seen such compassion for him before, except in the eyes of his mother and Boromir. And Faramir knew him. Though he had never seen this face before, he still knew him in his heart. ""My king!"" he whispered in wonder and fell to his knees, on impulse grabbing the man's hand and kissing it. Aragorn knelt in front of him, grasping his shoulders. ""Yes, my friend, it is I. And I have come to find you. You have dwelt in darkness long enough, Faramir, and it is time for you to return. I know that it will hurt,"" he said, and his voice was laden with pain. ""I knew Boromir. He was a good man, who deserved a better fate, and his passing grieved me greatly. Yet, I know that it is nothing compared to the grief that you now feel."" His grip on Faramir's shoulders tightened. ""I promised your brother that I would not let the City fall. Will you help me fulfill my promise?"" Faramir could not believe his eyes. Many times he had dreamed about the return of the king. He had always imagined a ruler wise and just, who cared deeply for his people and always knew what was best for them. And often he had feared that his dreams were too bold, and that he was asking for too much. But never, even in his boldest dreams, had he imagined that his lord king would look upon him, Faramir, with such care and compassion, with such friendship freely given. And then, all of a sudden, reality was better than the most pleasant of dreams. And he wanted to return to that reality. "" I will, my lord,"" he said. ""I will follow you wherever you lead me."" "" Good,"" said Aragorn with a smile. ""Come, my friend! We have lingered here too long!"" Faramir opened his eyes and took a deep breath. At first, he did not see the anxious faces around him. All he could see was his lord's weary face, looking at him with relief and warmth in the grey eyes. And then he had his anchor once again, keeping him in place in the raging sea of despair. If such a king had returned to them, Faramir mused, then perhaps the light had return to Gondor at long last. And perhaps the light had return to Middle-earth. But, most of all, the light had returned to him . ""My lord, you called me. I come.

""Gondor has a lot to offer,"" the irritating elf who stubbornly refused to let him alone repeated once again. ""If it is the price you do not agree with, then name your own! King Elessar is willing to negotiate. Your services in the past are highly valued and he remembers them. He will make sure you are rewarded as you deserve."" Dolen clenched his fists. This was already getting on his nerves. He had spent more than an hour arguing with this stubborn being while his people were dying out there! Couldn't this elf understand that he couldn't care less about the coal and his agreements with Gondor right now? All he could think about was how to kill the dragon. ""Don't you see that –"" The elf started once again, but was rudely interrupted. ""Yes, I see that, Lord Legolas!"" Dolen almost shouted. ""I see everything perfectly. What you fail to see is that this is pointless. I am not discussing this any further! I am not signing any agreements and this is it. It is about time that this mindless and arrogant king of yours realizes that I have much better things to worry about than the fact that Gondor is going to freeze this winter!"" The elf did not move a muscle, but his blue eyes suddenly turned cold as steel. ""I have to warn you,"" he said, and the icy voice sent shivers down the man's spine, ""that it is highly unwise to speak this way of King Elessar in my presence."" Arod can confirm that , he thought dryly. Dolen suppressed a shudder and looked the elf in the eyes. ""So you defend him?"" He muttered. ""Even though he is wrong."" ""Yes, I defend him, and he is not wrong,"" Legolas hissed, and his voice was even colder than before, something Dolen had thought impossible. The man frowned slightly. He had seen in the elf's gaze something he did not like. Or rather, something he liked . A lot. ""But you would defend him even if he was wrong?"" He asked with obvious curiosity. The elf looked confused by Dolen's behavior, but his voice remained just as cold. ""I cannot remember such a case and I doubt that it would ever happen. But I do not deny it – I would. I would do anything for King Elessar."" Dolen resisted the urge to grin. Anything . This was exactly what he was looking for. At last, he had discovered the only way to kill the dragon. ""Well, I must admit, Lord Legolas, that your precious king is offending me. Here I am, the Lord of Shapkar, ignoring all my other duties, and I am discussing my trade relationships with Gondor with a mere elf! Not with the King, mind you! Not even with the Steward!"" Legolas did his best not to feel offended by that. ""The King has more important work right now,"" he said as patiently as he could. ""And you think that I don't?"" Dolen sounded furious. ""I am ignoring all my other work, and, believe me, it is important, to discuss this agreement, and he sends me a mere elf! No, we can never reach an agreement this way."" Legolas raised his eyebrows in surprise as he started to guess where this was headed. ""So you want the King to come here?"" ""Yes."" Dolen looked pleased that the elf had understood. ""I want to meet with the King. And his family."" Legolas' eyes widened in shock. ""What? His family?"" It made no sense. No sense at all. ""I want King Elessar to come to Shapkar with his Queen and his son as a proof of his good will. Only then can we have negotiations."" Dolen's voice was firm and left no room for objections. The elf's eyes narrowed to mere slits. ""I am afraid this is impossible,"" he said, his voice equally firm. ""Then, I am afraid, Gondor's entire population will freeze this winter,"" Dolen replied. ""Tell this to your king. Let him decide what really matters."" While Legolas rode towards Minas Tirith, his heart was troubled. He would tell Aragorn what Dolen had said. No, there was no way he would lie to him, but he would strongly advise his friend not to do it. There was something in Dolen's eyes that had frightened him, and he hoped that Aragorn would see reason and try to find another way to find coal. But as far as he knew his friend, the man would do exactly what the Lord of Shapkar had asked. TBC Addition A/Ns: First, I just wanted to clarify that there were dragons during the Fourth Age, Tolkien had said it himself in a letter to one of his editors. Smaug was the last GREAT dragon, and dragons after him were smaller and didn't have so much contact with people, so they don't appear in most tales. You can find a brief discussion on dragons in the Estel Angst Central (link at my profile page). To those who haven't read ""Friendship…"" – the reference to Dargmor and his Corsairs is unfamiliar to you; let's just say that he was the 'main baddie' in Friendship… and had some unpleasant interactions with Eldarion, Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli, which nearly resulted in one or more deaths. I really think you don't need to have read it to understand this story. Future references will be one or two, and will be insignificant, I promise. Third, at the end of ""Faces of Darkness"" I said that you probably won't see this story until the end of June because I'm leaving mid-February and I'm not sure that I'll have constant internet access after that. However, I realized that I will be able to finish this story before then, it won't be too long, maybe 5-6 chapters. As always, reviews make me write faster and better :-) Thanks for reading! 9"

Even if she'd likely tear his head off as say hello if she saw him now, it would be nice for something Hank had a hand in to make good. And no matter what she thinks, he would never wish death on her. He always wanted the best for her, back in the day; it's what she never understood then. Five years of learning how to be a murderer sure wouldn't change that. He stays until the screens shut off, then turns and kicks a rock all the way back to catch the train for home. Amanda Sullivan lost her sister to the Games when she was fourteen years old, and she's never forgotten. It's a badge of honour that Amanda will carry with her until she's dead in the ground, even if Sloane shed her surname when she entered Residential and never mentioned Amanda by name once in all her camera-time. The recruiters came to the children's home when Amanda was just a baby. She doesn't remember but Sloane told her, when she was old enough to understand, that there was a reason the caretakers didn't hit them when they sometimes smacked the other kids. The Centre paid the orphanage a stipend to look after Sloane, and by extension Amanda, to keep them safe and healthy. The caretakers were afraid that if Sloane wasn't happy then the money would stop. It made sense to Amanda; why should the caretakers deserve to get anything from Sloane's training if half the marks on her didn't come from the Program kids at all? The fear of the Centre kept the caretakers' hands to themselves, even after Sloane went into Residential, because the money kept coming until Sloane graduated. Amanda will never, ever repay that debt. Sloane did, the only way she could: she went into the Arena as a tribute for District Two and didn't make it home a Victor. While Amanda still aches at the thought of losing her, she's never been prouder of anyone. Sloane fought and died for her sister and her district. In recognition, the Centre gave Amanda - as her only living family - the condolence payout and a small apartment near her school for the next five years. They even helped her find a job once she hit the legal age. People - stupid people, short-sighted people - call the Centre a death trap under their breaths, but they don't understand. They don't see what it does for children who have no way out, children who are desperate and angry and helpless. How it takes them and heals them and makes them strong, gives them confidence and helps them make something of themselves. Amanda became a teacher with the reference letter the Centre gave her. She's spent her life looking out for those children, the ones with no one to look out for them. She dedicated her all to guiding them to the place that will turn their lives around. She never sees most of them again, the way it should be - the Centre takes them at thirteen and becomes their family - but a few have found her after. They're Peacekeepers, or doctors, or politicians, and they tell her they never would've found their way to where they are now if she hadn't helped them find the Centre. A lot of Centre washouts go right back to the lives they left regardless of what the recruiting pamphlets say - they end up quarriers or factory workers like the rest of the blue-collar population - but not the ones Amanda finds. She has a knack for the special, the ones deserving of the best placements available. It keeps Amanda going, keeps the memory of Sloane alive, as the years pass and one decade turns into two. There was one girl, one girl who sticks in Amanda's memory like a splinter, a girl with the worst, most terrible parents imaginable. A girl with a fire in her eyes so bright that not even daily beatings could quench it, a girl with brilliance and potential and a soul that ripped Amanda's out. Amanda thinks more about her than most. She'll pass her final Reaping soon - this year, or maybe next, Amanda lost count - and like all the others the Centre will find her a place where she's meant to be. The girl this year, Lyme, standing in for a shivering, terrified thirteen-year-old with her hair in pigtails, reminds Amanda a little of Madeline. She could be Madeline, almost, but for the size of her and the different name. She looks out at the crowd with a cool arrogance that's much calmer than Madeline's barely-restrained fury, but they're alike enough for the comparison. Amanda thinks back to that girl with a fondness that the years have not managed to temper. Wherever she goes, Madeline will be brilliant, and like her, this girl - whether she wins or loses - will give the Capitol a fine show and represent District Two in a way that will make them all proud. Amanda has a sense of these things. None of the children Amanda's helped have ever made it to the Reaping, but that's the way it should be. She gave her sister freely and without regrets; the boys and girls she's saved since then are meant to mend the missing pieces in Amanda's life, not be further sacrifices. The Centre takes in many and only asks for the ultimate price from a precious few; the ones Amanda finds are the ones meant for something other than the Games. ""I like this one,"" says Dan in a low voice as the escort drones on and Lyme ignores the prattle with a Career's practiced disregard. ""We should see if we can't send her something later, pitch in for some water or a tinderbox, maybe."" ""Yes, let's,"" Amanda says, leaning her head against his shoulder. ""I've got a good feeling about her."""
301,1,31,1-Lorata-31.txt,hunger-games,Lorata,"Heidi's missing limb, grafted onto a new body with no reason to think about the old one. ""Did you really expect any different?"" Marc asks her, coming up behind her and laying his hands on her shoulders. ""What was the boy gonna do, suddenly turn soft and beg his mama to let him come home? I don't think so."" ""I didn't expect nothing,"" Heidi snaps, sharper than she meant to because she doesn't want him to be right. ""He did what's right and so did we, that's all there is to it."" The day before Brutus leaves the Capitol to head back to Two, Heidi gets a letter in the mail. It's written on good, thick paper, the kind that creases good and proper and has fibres when you tear it, and her heart skips with fear at the large wax seal on the envelope before she registers the 'O' instead of 'S'. It's much less terrifying to get a letter from Odin instead of the President, and when Marc goes to shower off the worst of the quarry from his skin, Heidi slides the envelope open. It takes her a while to read because she was never too good at it - numbers, fine, but words not so much - and Odin always uses five-dollar words like they're gonna be outlawed tomorrow, and when she finishes Heidi closes her eyes and holds the paper against her chest, breathing out nice and slow through her nose so she doesn't lose it. I wish to thank you personally for your efforts in aiding the public relations element of Brutus' Games, Odin writes in flowing, elegant script that marks him as the son of someone rich enough to afford good schooling, not just the kind that learned him his letters and the important bits of history. You are, I'm sure, cognizant of the rarity of your actions, and you ought to be commended, if not officially, then at least by someone who understands. Your words and generosity contributed to Brutus' victory and you should be made aware that I, as his mentor, am grateful. However, you must also realize that for his own safety and emotional security, you cannot be allowed to see Brutus henceforth. He has a new life and a new role, and it would not do to confuse him; recovery is a difficult process for any victor, and it will be best for him to make a clean break. I will not cheapen your actions by reminding you that you have given up legal rights and are not entitled to his winnings nor to a house in the Victors' Village; I am sure you understand. Instead I once more give you my gratitude, and assure you that Brutus is a fine boy who will be well looked after. You need not be alarmed for his wellbeing. Heidi traces her fingers over the broad, sweeping signature under the last Yours faithfully , swallowing hard against the rock in her throat. It's a tremendous honour for her to get anything from Odin at all, even though he was careful not to mention the words 'parent' or 'son' anywhere in it and to keep the language as distant as possible. He didn't have to send her anything or acknowledge her participation, and even this letter, a polite brush-off as firm and unyielding as Heidi has ever heard, is more than she could have asked for. The water in the shower cuts off, and Heidi grabs a book from their shelf at random and shoves the letter between two of the pages at the centre. To shake the last of the feeling away, she catches Marc before he slips into their bedroom to change into his clothes and tells him she's holding them hostage until he pays the toll. Marc chuckles, catches her around the waist and tells her he'd rather be an outlaw, and if both of them laugh a little too hard and kiss a little too fierce out of a desperate need to prove something to themselves, it doesn't matter. They get an hour off when Brutus' train rushes through the district to the main city, and all the quarriers crowd the barriers by the tracks, waiting to catch a glimpse. Kev offered Heidi his day off as a trade in case she wanted to ride in and see Brutus arrive at the Justice Building in person, but she declined, and he didn't push it after that. Instead Heidi stands shoulder to shoulder with her friends and family, listening for the low hum that signals the train coming. The driver must've seen the crowd ahead, because when the train does arrive it's at half speed, and instead of waving through the windows, Brutus and Odin stand just inside the open door, one hand lifted in greeting, the other pressed to their chests in traditional gesture. The crowd around Heidi goes crazy, waving and shouting and throwing summer daisies, and in the centre of it Heidi alone stands still, her fist held over her heart. Maybe she imagines it; maybe she just sees what she wants to see; maybe it's a hallucination from the heat and exhaustion. But Heidi knows what she sees, whether it's real or not: Odin touches Brutus' shoulder and murmurs in his ear, and for a split-second Brutus' bright blue eyes meet hers, hold and dig into her like a nail in the bottom of her foot, before the train whips him away. It's the last time Heidi will ever see her son save on television, and he's already far away, disappearing into someone else, someone with no parents, no family but the one joined in blood that's spilled instead of shared. The last time she'll ever see him, and all she has to remember him is a moment of eye contact that she very probably invented. It's enough. ""Well,"" Heidi says, taking a deep breath and clapping the nearest person on the shoulder. ""Back to work."""

She doesn't interact with Nero much, he and his whole line of Victors are a little too irreverent, too unconcerned with district loyalty for Petra to spend much time with them in any comfort, but she has no problem with Nero himself. He's a good mentor and brings in more sponsor money than half the other Victors combined, and he's never patronized Petra or made her feel weak even though he's the only Two bigger than Brutus. But then it happens. Nero glances up, and Petra tells herself not to, wills herself to stare past him at the snowy Village beyond, but it's too late. Up, up, up her gaze turns, up to the stupid spray of mistletoe dangling from the lamp at the edge of the basketball court. ""Mentor fucker !"" Petra spits out, and slams her cane down hard enough that it cracks the thin layer of ice beneath her feet. ""I hate this!"" ""Aw, Petra—"" Nero says, and his youngest Victor is Enobaria which means he's well versed in all kinds of ways to placate former killers out of having temper tantrums but Petra can't bear to hear it, not today. ""Hey,"" calls out a voice from across the court, and Emory jogs over, wearing cleated sneakers and a sweater over her workout gear despite the subzero temperature. ""Is that a challenge?"" Nero frowns. ""Yeah, but —"" Emory comes to a stop in front of them, breath puffing white in front of her. She's Petra's oldest Victor-sibling, Brutus' first, and Petra might have scoffed in private at her mediocre Games showing when she was a stupid, arrogant teenager but now she admires Emory more than anyone but their mentor himself. ""Petra, will you accept a champion?"" Emory asks, putting on a lilting accent and sweeping her arm out in a bow. ""I would be happy to fight on your behalf."" The urge to fight still burns under Petra's skin like the time the Centre injected her with capsaicin to test her pain tolerance, but Nero's eyebrows have crept up his head and Emory smiles at her, warm and supporting, and the itch actually fades. ""Yes, of course,"" Petra says, and she holds out her cane and touches Emory on one shoulder, then the other. ""I would be honoured to accept you as my champion."" ""Ha,"" Nero says, grinning. His neck is the size of Emory's bicep but she doesn't back down, only cracks her neck from side to side and stretches out her arms in a theatrical show of preparation. ""You're on then,"" he says, and tips and invisible hat to Petra. ""This is for you, girl."" ""For you, my lady,"" Emory says to Petra, blowing her an invisible kiss, and the warmth in Petra's chest expands until she thinks she'll burst. ""On three,"" Petra calls out, since while she's here she may as well adjudicate, and the two of them fall into matching ready stances. The mistletoe festivities end when a representative from Victor Affairs delivers an official statement from the Village's official doctor, refusing to treat any more physical injuries until the end of the year. She'd attached the butcher's bill to the letter, a list of all the bones set, all the limbs splinted, every gash stitched and socket relocated, and threatened to come down and personally sedate all of them until the end of the holidays if the madness did not stop. Ronan reads the letter aloud at the town hall meeting, looking out at the sea of bruised cheeks, swollen eyes and bent noses. ""I think that concludes our newest solstice tradition,"" he says. ""I'd say being banned by a medical professional makes this year's Harvest Festival a rounding success. Let's hear it for our enterprising holiday entrepreneurs!"" Misha and Devon both stand and bow — both of them sporting twin black eyes, Devon a butterfly bandage on one cheek — as the others applaud. Ronan waves them back to their seats, then raises his hand to gather everyone's attention. ""I propose a corollary tradition — finding every last piece of mistletoe, real or plastic or embroidered or what have you, and bringing them to the square for a celebratory bonfire. All those in favour?"" The Village votes unanimous, and Ronan announces the meeting adjourned. ""I bet I find more than you,"" Misha says to Devon as they begin to file out of the hall. ""I bet you don't!"" Devon shoots back. ""Whoever finds the fewest bits of mistletoe eats my laundry!"" Misha shouts to the hall at large, then kisses Devon, trips him, and weaves past the others to tear out into the snow. Devon swears, picks himself up, and races after her. ""That is not —"" Ronan starts, but then as one after another Victor grins in challenge, he sighs and drops his hand. ""All right, fine, the Victor with the most mistletoe at the end of the night is the ultimate winner of the Harvest Festival,"" he says. ""Just no bodily harm if you can help it, please."" ""Me and my kids against yours,"" Brutus challenges Lyme, who throws up a vulgar gesture with two fingers in response, and they rush out with the others. Ronan takes the long way back to his house, moving slowly and sedately across the snow-laden paths, listening to the chaos as his children tear through the Village. He lowers himself down onto his front stoop, joints creaking, and reaches over to pet his hounds when they push through the dog door and flop down next to him. ""Happy Harvest,"" Ronan says to his dogs, to the Village, to his Victors as they race through the trees like children, and to the giant pile of mistletoe beneath his porch that he gathered before the meeting and stuffed into a large burlap sack. ""Snow bless us, every one."""
303,1,1,1-Lorata-1.txt,hunger-games,Lorata,"I'm sure there will be people into that,"" he says, trying for neutral support. People will do all kinds of crazy things nowadays. ""Oh, there will,"" Lyme says in a tone that makes Brutus want to run for the door. ""But this is good, see? Mutual 'nope'. Means Nero won't bug me so much to be reasonable if it's you too."" Brutus begs the food to get there faster. He ordered his steak rare, how much time can that possibly take? She glances up after a while of scribbling, eyes narrowed in thought. ""Also, you look like you want kids."" Brutus jerks back. ""Am I on trial here? Look, write about how much you don't want to fuck me or whatever, but there's a line."" Lyme puts the pen down. ""Okay, okay, sorry. You just look like the kind of guy who wants kids -"" Brutus says nothing, lapsing into stony silence - ""and that's a never for me, a big serious never ever. And that's not like the type of guy I think is hot or the kind of sex I want to have. If you want kids and I don't, it's shitty from the start for me to say anything but no."" Brutus' breath aches in his chest. This is not what he wanted for his evening. He'd rather go home and take a sword to the leg. He presses his thumb and forefinger to the arch of his eyebrows, elbow resting on the table, and tries for something - anything - to say but everything twists itself ugly and mocking inside him. ""Pretty sure it's a moot point whether I do or not,"" Brutus says at last, grinding his teeth so hard a spike of pain shoots up his jaw. ""Fuck,"" Lyme mutters, and Brutus doesn't look up because he doesn't trust himself but he thinks that's genuine regret in her tone. ""Look, you know how weird this is, right? I know half the Village was hoping I'd be the perfect wife for you because you've been waiting so long or whatever, but I'm not, okay?"" ""Yeah, I got it,"" Brutus grits out, and where is the Games-damned food. Lyme sighs. ""All I mean is, I know this is worse for you than me. I don't want anybody, ever, no matter how much Nero harps on me about how when I'm old I'll be sad I don't have a husband to change my diaper or whatever. I'm glad I'm not what you want because it means I won't have to put up with you chasing me."" She runs a hand through her hair, tugging at the short strands. ""But I went into this hoping it would fail, and you probably didn't, so. For what it's worth, that sucks, and I'm sorry."" Brutus drags both hands down his face, and there is no way to salvage this evening, is there. She'll never understand what it's like to watch the Games and wonder if this will be his future wife before seeing her cut down in a spray of blood. She won't take the female tribute three years in like Brutus did, even though that meant she'd be off-limits to Brutus as a future partner, because taking the boy would've either meant trying to kill her or hoping his tribute died so he could have a shot at marriage. ""Well, at least you know I won't be chasing you,"" Brutus says, with what he hopes is the proper amount of levity. ""So maybe you can stop trying to chop my legs off every time I open my mouth."" Lyme gives him a long, considering stare, then actually grins a little. ""Yeah, you've got a point. We should have a toast to a long, happy life of never wanting to fuck each other - at least, if they'd actually bring the drinks."" She says that last bit with a raised voice, and Brutus would feel worse except he'd almost go back into the Arena for a beer right now. Funny enough, it's easier to talk after that. Halfway through the meal, Lyme spears a small potato and waves it at him. ""You know they're full of shit, right? Nero, Odin, and yeah, you. All this freaking out over making sure you have somebody to sleep in the same bed. We're in the Village, aren't we? Who cares if you're not married, you're surrounded by people who understand you."" It's not about that, not at all. Lyme is so far off the mark the trainers wouldn't even make her run laps, they'd pull her aside and ask her what the hell was wrong, but there's no point in arguing. Because no, it's not the same, because what Brutus wants is the whole thing, and he can't get that from his mentor or his fellow victors or even a friend. Because maybe if Brutus had one person he could try to make happy every day - a person where his job is make her happy, where making her smile is worth more than money or sponsorship agreements - then what he does the rest of the year might not be so hard. He wants someone who can make him feel a little less like he's only pretending to be human, who could dig inside him and find the good man that he's trying so desperately to be after a decade of burying him away. But Lyme's right about one thing: ain't her fault that it can't be her. ""So does that mean you'll change my diaper for me when we're old?"" Brutus asks, baring his teeth at Lyme instead. ""Since we're such good friends now."" She looks at him, startled, then laughs without an edge underneath it for the first time that evening. ""You first,"" Lyme shoots back. ""But I bet you'll shit yourself more than me."" ""You know, it's a shame you want to stay single, because you're a real peach,"" Brutus drawls, and Lyme kicks him hard under the table."
304,1,26,1-Lorata-26.txt,hunger-games,Lorata,"She counts as high as she can go. She tries to name all the mayors of District Two since the last Quarter Quell. She thinks of every nursery rhyme the teachers used to sing to them when she was little. Finally Pa stops - his arm must be tired, the last while he hasn't been hitting as hard - and he shoves her away from him. ""Next time,"" he growls, ""I use the buckle end. You have no idea what you've got yourself into, little girl."" Madeline waits until his footfalls fade down the stairs before she lets herself cry, bitter and furious and silent. She twists around, trying to see her back, but she can't make it out well enough to tell if there are marks. Her calves are scored with raised pink welts, but Madeline thinks they'll fade soon enough. The worst isn't just how it hurts but the deep, gnawing sense of helplessness inside her, twisting until she feels just as sick from that as she does from the humiliation and pain. Finally she gets herself under control, but when Madeline tries to push open the door, it sticks in the frame and the handle won't turn. Madeline glares over her shoulder at the window, but she doesn't want to risk it. Not yet. He'll let her out tomorrow morning and she can wash her face before school. He won't want her going with dried blood crusted all over her lower face, that'd shame him just as much as her clothes. Madeline pulls herself upright, ignoring the twinges all over her, and stares at herself in the mirror. The kid who stares back is angry, scary, and not at all pretty. Not someone who will grow up into a pretty girl and get lots of boys wanting to marry her. The Madeline in the mirror looks like she might pull a knife out of nowhere and stick it in your gut before she'll let you touch her, and that's good enough. She doesn't get to eat supper that night, but it doesn't matter. Victory sits in her stomach just as heavy as any meal. ""Madeline!"" her teacher gasps. ""What happened?"" She lowers her voice, starts to lay a hand on Madeline's shoulder but pulls back. ""Did someone hurt you?"" For a moment, Madeline pictures telling the teacher about Pa. She imagines the Peacekeepers showing up at the house, clapping cuffs on his wrists and dragging him away. It's a glorious image for all of three seconds, but after that it sours. Mama doesn't have any skills - Pa always reminds them they'd both be nowhere without him, and Madeline would get more mad at that except she's never seen Mama do anything useful ever - and Madeline's not old enough to do anything even if she did. If they take Pa away they'll take Madeline away and put her in a home, and she might hate Mama but not enough to give up her house and her room and her life just yet. Madeline looks up at Mrs. Sullivan and shakes her head. ""I was playing on the rock pile and I fell,"" she says. The cut on her lip stretches when she smiles. ""I won't do that again."" Mrs. Sullivan gives Madeline a long look, giving her time to change her mind, then sighs. ""Be careful next time,"" she says. ""And if you get hurt again, you can tell me."" The other kids whisper, but one glare from Madeline sets them quiet. Nobody talks to her at all until lunch - she doesn't have one, not today, who knows how long Pa will keep food away as a punishment - when the boy whose clothes she stole sits down next to her on the bench. ""You're not wearing a dress today,"" he says, tentative. ""Nope,"" Madeline says, not looking at him. Pause. After a minute he says, ""You want my hat? It'd hide your face."" Madeline says noting, just stares out over the playground at the flocks of kids laughing and running around and trading each other bits of their lunches. The boy gets up, comes back a few minutes later with a cap that he holds out to her. Madeline snatches it out of his hand and jams it down hard on her head, pulling the brim down low over her eyes. He's right, it will cover the worst of her face, at least her bruised and swollen nose, and she grunts. ""Good luck,"" the boy says, but he leaves before Madeline can tip her head up and scowl at him. That night after school, Madeline takes the long way home around the abandoned quarry, skirting the empty scar in the earth until she makes it back to her house. Pa is waiting for her when she gets there - he'll have left work early - and she tenses when she walks up, ready for him to make good on his promise. ""You want to be a boy, I'm gonna treat you like a boy,"" Pa says to Madeline when she stops in front of him, scuffing her shoes in the dirt. She can't see his face past the brim of her hat, but his voice doesn't sound like he's going to hit her. He's angry still but it's pulled back, the way Mama's got when Madeline came home with the back of her skirt torn because she chased a boy over the fence. ""Come down to the shop with me. You're gonna start working the stone after school. No more games, no more playing, you hear me? If I had a son I'd start training him now. Guess that means you."" Madeline doesn't say anything, but she drops her bag on the floor and doesn't take off her shoes. Pa grunts and heads out the door. When they get back, Madeline starts for her room. ""Where you think you're going?"" Pa demands. ""Go wash up and help your mother set the table for supper."""
305,1,16,1-Lorata-16.txt,hunger-games,Lorata,"with kids so the kids can contribute; there's the Program so families can get money and food that way. If you work hard, the Capitol will provide."" ""It just doesn't feel like it was that hard,"" Devon says, but his shoulders unclench just a little. ""I mean it was three weeks!"" ""You worked for ten whole years to get to those three weeks,"" Brutus points out, eyes narrowing. Nobody is gonna talk shit about his Victor, including his Victor. ""It's not like you just strolled in and got lucky with a few hammer swings. You didn't cheat and use a fucking forcefield to take the competition out for you, or just take longer to starve than anyone else. Anybody who wins deserves respect for that, whether they won by combat or default or what, but don't knock what you did. You won because you've been training for this since you were seven. Don't make it less than that."" ""But -"" ""Rule one,"" Brutus says sharply. ""What is it? Tell me."" Devon sucks in a breath. ""It's never over."" ""That's right. The house, that's what you got for winning and all the training you did to get there. The Parcel Days, that's your way of paying back the district that made you and fed you and supported you. Your stipend from here on, you're gonna earn that."" And the thing is, Brutus has the best kids in the Village, because where others might whine or get entitled, Devon brightens. ""Really? How?"" ""Lots of ways. Mentoring, getting sponsors."" Brutus leans back in the booth, studying the lanky eighteen-year-old sitting across from him, mouth shiny from butter grease. ""You can come do recruiting with me, go to hospitals and schools and orphanages and tell kids about the Program, how they can get stipends for their families. The more kids you get to join the Program, the more parents get to feed their kids. There's lots of things you can do to help people that ain't running through the streets throwing money at their heads. But I don't wanna hear you say you don't deserve what you get, because you do. You earned it by walking through that gate, and you could sit on your ass for the rest of your life and still deserve it but I know you won't."" ""No!"" Devon sits up, rearing back so hard he nearly smacks his head against the booth. ""What? No! No, I want to work. It wouldn't be right just to sit around and only work one month a year."" This time Brutus does smile; he said the same thing to Odin back in the day, and Odin gave him the same amused, indulgent look he's likely shooting at Devon now. ""Kiddo, mentoring ain't just one month a year. Even without all the recruiting stuff, mentoring is a full-time job. There's sponsor deals and exposure and all kinds of things year-round; you build your brand and you work to sell yourself just as much as the tributes; if you do it right, sponsors will line up for you before they ever see your kid because they'll want to work with you."" He grins, sharp and predatory. Fewer pleasures in life rank with taking money from someone dumb enough to use it to stick peacock feathers in their ass and saving a kid's life with it instead. ""I bet you could fleece 'em all and they'd thank you for the privilege after, with that doe face of yours."" ""Me, fleece people?"" Devon opens his eyes wide and innocent, and Brutus laughs out loud. Devon smiles, and once again Brutus' chest tightens. Devon kissed the One girl and slid a knife between her ribs while she sighed against his mouth, then convinced the rest of the Pack one of the outliers must have done it while they slept; the next night he slit the Four boy's throat as they lay tangled together by the campfire. Now he sits in an oversized sweater with the sleeves pulled down and stares at a list of ice cream sundaes. ""Thanks,"" he says. ""I feel better."" Devon won't thank Brutus two or three years from now when he sits in the sponsor ring for real and tallies up how many meals and knives and trauma kits the jewellery and cosmetic surgery around him could buy; won't thank Brutus the first time he picks a boy or girl to be his tribute and they die in the dust from a sword to the gut or a rock to the side of the head, the first time their blood soaks the grass or clumps the sand or spreads out through the water in a thick red cloud. Soon enough he'll learn that the price he paid in knives and broken necks is just the first instalment in a debt that never ends. It's never over, not ever, and soon he'll learn there are far worse things than standing over the body of a twelve-year-old with his finger-bruises purpling her throat. But not now; right now it's less than six months out and his boy has just started sleeping through the night without waking up in cold sweats and reaching for his knives. Now Brutus has friendship bracelets tied around his wrists that he'll wear until they fall off naturally because Devon read about it in a book. ""'Course you do, 'cause you're a smart boy who listens to his mentor,"" Brutus says. ""Now get the damn ice cream before I have to feed it to you like a baby."" ""Yes, sir,"" Devon says, but then his eyes glint with a hint of the wicked light that made the sponsors fall over themselves for him even if his kills were clean and not flashy. ""So does that mean you would feed it to me, hypothetically, or -"" ""Don't push it, boy,"" Brutus warns, flattening his eyes, and Devon grins, picks up the dessert menu and orders the biggest, most ridiculous sundae in the restaurant."
306,1,9,1-Lorata-9.txt,hunger-games,Lorata,"believe it, even though you said you were coming. It's like it's not real."" Brutus only nods as Emory's confusion grows, and the smile glows warm in his chest as he savours the moment. ""Brought you a few things,"" he says. ""Emory makes a fine apple jam, last of the fall crop, and you ain't tasted rhubarb pie until you've had hers."" The woman stumbles back a step. ""After everything you did, here you are bringing more! Snow's mercy, as if you ain't done enough. Come in, come in, our Bethany hasn't been able to sit down all day."" Emory stops, one foot on the stair. ""Bethany,"" she says slowly. ""I know that name, why do I know that name?"" ""Go on inside and see,"" Brutus says, and Emory bites her lip but in the end she trusts her mentor — of course she does — and she steps inside. Brutus counts down from ten as he kicks off his shoes, and he's down to three when Emory sucks in a gasp. ""Oh,"" she says, eyes gone big and wide. ""That's — oh ."" A Reaping-aged girl, pretty and slender without an ounce of quarry blood in her, slips in from the kitchen and steps close to her mother. Bethany Williams, fourteen years old, called in the Reaping of the 52nd Hunger Games. The girl who would've died if Emory hadn't stepped in to take her place. Her mother gives her a nudge. ""Go on, now, this is no time to be shy."" She gives Emory a small smile. ""Couldn't tear her away from the screen the whole time, you know. Normally I wouldn't let her watch that much, but she said she had to."" ""I did have to,"" the girl bursts out. ""I did, I — you went in for me, and you made it through that awful Arena with all those traps and no grass or sky or trees or anything —"" Emory inhales a careful breath at the memory, and Brutus doesn't weaken her by reaching out to touch her in front of others but he does take a step close until she swallows and exhales. ""I would've died right away, I know I would, but you were so smart. You waited and you figured it out and you won and I'm so happy you made it out. You're brave and strong and — and everything."" A flush crawls up from Emory's throat and takes over her entire face, ears flaming bright red. ""I just did my duty,"" she says, falling back on the stock phrase because the Centre prepared her for grilling in the Capitol and how to smile in the face of a hundred flashbulbs. Gamemakers with their scoreboards and sponsors who smile like vultures and scent for blood, yes, Emory charmed them all with her simple manners and her complete lack of artifice. They trained her for all that, but not this. Not blind, adoring gratitude from the one person with a real connection instead of picking a favourite based on training scores and personality. ""And we're very grateful for it,"" the girl's mother says, pulling her daughter back and wrapping an arm around her shoulders. ""It's just the two of us, now that my Blaine's passed on. If I'd lost her — Please, sit down, I'll make you some coffee."" They stay a good hour, long enough that it doesn't feel like they're rushing but not so long that the family feels obligated to ask them to stay for a meal. Emory's still pink around the cheeks and ears when they say goodbye, and Brutus scrawls the address for Victor Affairs on a scrap of paper and hands it over when the girl asks if she can write now and then. Brutus says nothing once they're back in the truck, waiting as Emory twists around to wave through the back window before the house disappears around a curve. Finally Emory sits back and pulls her seatbelt back into place, letting it snap against her chest and shoulder. ""You did that on purpose,"" she says, glancing at Brutus. ""Damn right I did,"" he says, and Emory snorts in surprise. ""Not everything has to be sneaky. Sometimes there's a thing you need to hear and I'm gonna make sure you hear it."" He waits, fingers tight on the wheel, for Emory to say that it doesn't matter if it was her, they would've been just as glad for any other Career girl to step in, but this time she doesn't. She stares down at her hands instead, running her fingers over the inside of her knuckles, smooth where Remake erased the gashes that the garrotte wire had torn into her skin. Brutus grips the wheel harder to stop himself from covering her hand with his. ""Maybe we could stop by the market,"" Emory says after a while, still looking down. ""I know it's too early for fresh vegetables, but we could get bread and things."" Brutus swallows. ""Yeah?"" ""You've been cooking a lot,"" Emory says slowly, and Brutus barely dares to breathe. ""I should make you something."" ""Emory —"" ""I want to make you something,"" she corrects herself. ""Stew, maybe. Something hearty."" Brutus watches the road with an intensity that definitely isn't warranted to keep his eyes from flicking sideways. ""They sell cheese down there, real sharp stuff. Don't need much to get the flavour, you just sprinkle some on top and it melts right in. You ever have cheese in stew?"" ""No, ain't never,"" Emory says. They'll have trained the quarry-area grammar out of her in the Program the same as Brutus, but just like with him the longer she's home the more creeps back in. ""But it sounds good. Show me what's good and I'll grab some."" It's the first she's mentioned using her stipend on anything for herself, and ahead the sun glitters on the distant mountaintops as Brutus pulls the truck into town. ""Sounds like a plan to me,"" he says."
307,1,23,1-Lorata-23.txt,hunger-games,Lorata,"taking the window side. He focuses on the drive, the paved street that turns into a gravel road that turns off onto a dirt lane winding between the trees, breathes in the familiar scent of home and watches the mountains grow in front of them. He doesn't let himself think about Nero and Devon and all the others standing in a long, silent line while one of their own gets lowered into the ground. Then they're home, and they step through the gate and Petra launches herself at him at full speed like a tiny, red-haired missile of pure muscle. Brutus nearly falls right on his ass, and he catches her and lifts her into the air, spins her and holds her against his chest as she cries and laughs and clings to him, alternately pulling back to beat him with her fists and shower him with curses. Brutus laughs, and cries, and laughs again, and for that moment — like the first full breath of air after breaking the surface of the water — everything finally, wonderfully, feels the way it should. The next year is a shit-show. They cancel the Victory Tour. Brutus isn't surprised, exactly, not with half the mentors dead and another chunk still missing, but it's still a shock to see such a longstanding tradition put aside. The Tour will continue next year, says the official announcement, but this year President Snow feels that the country has no time for celebrating. Not with so much work to do. Brutus, if he's being honest, doesn't pay much attention. If there's one good thing to come out of this whole fucking mess, it's that he is finally, honest to fucking goodness retired . No more mentoring, no more sponsor deals, fuck it and the whole fucking mess. From now on it's Brutus, his porch, his beers, and however long his brain gives him before it starts climbing the walls from boredom. The surprise — or maybe not — is that Lyme retires, too. They don't talk about it, but the day Brutus hands in his paperwork Lyme shows up with a six-pack of beers for him and a bottle of whiskey for her, and something about the set of her jaw tells him right there. They sit together on Brutus' porch swing, make a silent toast and drink without talking, Lyme with her legs tucked under her and Brutus pushing the swing with one foot against the ground. He still dreams of Enobaria, but that's a small price to pay for living. District 1 wins the next Hunger Games, a pretty little girl who smiles and flirts and winks over her shoulder and makes all the right promises with every teasing smile. Brutus can't watch more than five minutes before he's sick to his stomach, and he thinks of Cashmere and Gloss dead in the water — Finnick Odair coughing in the sand — and the price that the remaining Victors and all the ones to come will have to pay to make up for their loss. He doesn't let himself learn her name. District 1 wins the year after that, too, a boy this time, and before he's even pulled from the Arena the commenters are already salivating. Brutus puts a bottle through his television screen and stalks out to the gym. He stays there until his arms are shaking and he takes a hard fall from the pull-up bar that knocks his shoulder out of place. The next year it's District 10. She's a pretty girl too, strong and proud with flashing dark eyes, and she stands with her feet planted and hands on her hips, the tilt of her head just shy of arrogance. With District 4 out of favour following its role in the failed we-don't-speak-of-it in the 75th, District 10 has risen to take its place. Its people are strong, its children used to death and slaughter, and at the end of the day, humans are just another type of animal, after all. It doesn't take much to see that soon there will be athletic clubs popping up all over the district. Emory's boy wins the year after that, her first, the first of any mentor who won after Lyme. Brutus should be proud of her, should be glad that the next generation has finally made its mark, but as he watches the boy — so young, were they always this young? — blink up at the sky, face smeared with blood and grime, the only thing that Brutus tastes is sour. Before he knows what's happening, Brutus finds himself standing, leaving the house and taking the wooded path over to Lyme's. He pushes open the door hard enough that it bangs against the wall, and she looks up at him from the couch, startled. At least, she's startled for a second; after that she relaxes, and it's weird but after that moment everything about her says, finally . ""Listen,"" Brutus says. His voice sounds too loud in his head, his heart a thundering staccato. ""What would you done if I'd'a died that time?"" Lyme's eyes glitter. ""You know exactly what,"" she says, her voice like a cobra, coiled and looking for a foot to strike. Brutus' breath rasps in his chest. He hasn't mentored in five years but he has been listening, and he's heard the rumours. Uprisings. Blockades. Networks of spies and traitors from district to district, running everything from supplies to fugitives to secrets. Whispers that the missing Victors weren't executed, but were taken to a hidden Capitol facility and held there in case they're ever needed for leverage. ""Okay,"" Brutus says, and just like that — like the swing of a sword, like gravity taking over after stepping off the cliff — it's easy. Practically inevitable. If there's a Victor afterlife, Beetee will be shitting his fucking pants right now. You could never be one of us , indeed. ""Tell me what I need to do."" Lyme smiles."
308,1,34,1-Lorata-34.txt,hunger-games,Lorata,"Centre that trained them, raised them, moulded them, made them who they are. It's a reminder of where they've come, what they've sacrificed to be here. If a Two wins, there's often not much left of the bracelet. The strands will be soaked with blood, the finish on the beads scratched, and sometimes the leather frays or snaps right through. That's why, if a Two wins, their mentor gives a drawing of the bracelet to a special artist down in Career-town at the base of the mountain beneath the Victors' Village, and he inks the swirl of black and dots of colour right onto their wrists. It marks them, sets them apart and binds them together all at the same time, this community of killers that no one else could possibly hope to understand. Lyme can't stop looking at hers. At first the skin is red and puffy and irritated from the dye, the slide of the needle beneath her skin, and it itches and burns and never leaves her alone. She scratches at it until her mentor tells her to let it be, but how can she let it be when it never leaves her alone? Lyme's convinced that the tattoo artist put capsaicin in with the dye because even when she closes her eyes she feels the tattoo winding round her wrist like a snake. Her mentor catches her one morning in the kitchen, standing over the sink and scrubbing her arm with salt while the wound oozes raw and red but the ink stays clear. ""No, little girl,"" he says, sharp and firm, never mind that she's almost as tall as he is. He drags her into the bathroom and washes the salt away, bandages it up with gauze, and at least the smooth stretch of white against her skin is better than the band of black. But it's not enough, and fourteen people are dead because of Lyme - more than half of them under the legal age - and soon after he finds her with a paring knife and has to stop her from sticking it beneath her skin and slicing the tattoo away like she would an orange peel. ""No,"" he says again, and he fights her, holds her down with her shoulders flat against the floor and tells her he's not going anywhere until she listens. ""Why do I have to have this?"" Lyme struggles, but he's bigger and stronger and knows her better than she knows herself and she can't budge him. ""I hate it! I don't want to look at it anymore!"" ""You have it because it's a reminder,"" he says, and Lyme snorts and turns her head away. He turns her back with a finger against her cheek. ""Don't snort at me, little girl, this is important. It's a reminder of who made you and who can unmake you."" Lyme closes her eyes, and he lets her. ""What do I do?"" she asks, her voice sticking in her throat. ""I can't wash it away."" ""No, you can't,"" he says. He's not talking about the ink and neither is she. ""But what you do is become a mentor. Each kid that goes in and doesn't come out, that's your penance. Each one that does, that's one brick in the road to redemption."" That's cold comfort, but Lyme swallows. ""How far does the road go?"" ""Forever,"" he says, and he kisses her on the forehead. ""Until your last heartbeat, darlin', that's what we swore and that's what we do. But we claw back a little of what we can each time we bring one back."" Lyme sags, and he lets her up and wraps a broad arm around her shoulders. ""Can I wear long sleeves?"" she asks finally, leaning her head against his shoulder. ""Yeah, that, that's fine. You can wear whatever you want. Nobody said you gotta flaunt it."" He works his fingers into her hair. ""Get dressed, I'll take you clothes shopping."" Lyme doesn't move. Fourteen corpses feeding the soil because of her; knock off the criminals the Centre used for her kill tests, that's still ten kids. Even if Lyme mentors every year she can for as long as her body can take it, even if she pulls a miracle once out of every three kids who go in - more than any mentor in history - she'll still never repay that debt. And even if she did, for every kid she saves that's twenty-three others gone, including one of their own. It's hopeless. It's hopeless, yet certainty builds in Lyme's chest until she all but burns with it, that it might mean nothing but she's going to mentor until the day she dies anyway. ""Listen,"" her mentor says, and he squeezes her shoulder. ""Lemme tell you a story about a kid from Four who threw a starfish back into the sea."" It's a silly story, but as the years pass she thinks of it every time a tribute's blood splashes the camera lens and the cannon fires, every time she stays awake in the Control Room for weeks on end while her brain buzzes with stimulants and the backs of her eyelids itch. For the times when she sits next to the broken remnants of what was once a beautiful, laughing child and dips her hands in their blood, untangles their twisted psyches around her fingers and begins to weave them back together into something resembling human. It matters to this one , said the boy in the story as he tossed a starfish back into the ocean. In the end, Lyme saves only a handful - still more than almost any other mentor but not enough, never enough - but she clings to them anyway, her Victors, and each one keeps the darkness at bay a little longer. You matter , she thinks as she holds them, fights them, pins them down and weathers the worst they know to throw at her. You matter to me ."

A stallion does not choose the moment of its taming; only its master can do that, and while Seneca is not exactly patient, he has learned the value of biding his time when necessary. ""The interruption has, I'm afraid, made me lose my appetite for the evening,"" Seneca says, waving a hand and affecting unconcern. ""You may escort the lady out. I'm sure she can find her way home."" ""I'm sure you can get your money back if you ask nicely,"" Johanna shoots back on her way through the door. That night Seneca's fury eats away at him, consuming him from the inside out like maggots writhing in a corpse. She's not who he thought she was; the brilliant, manipulative girl who took all of Panem by the throat and forced them to sit up and take notice, who crawled to Victory through a wave of blood and smoke and entrails, she can be undone by something as easily as the pressures of victory themselves. She would take death over the glory her life could be - a life in his bed, at his side, under his protection, until the next Quarter Quell and beyond - and he thought her more than this. She would likely call it bravery, but Seneca has seen such bravery before. He calls it commonplace. In the end, Johanna Mason is just another tribute, just like the rest of them; the only difference is that unlike the others, she had the gall to tell him no , and Seneca will not stand for that. Not from her. Not from anyone. The President calls him in the next morning. Seneca stands in his office with a ring of bruises purpling his throat, a bandage over the knife wound and a plaster over the wound above his eyebrow. He stands battered but unbowed, and Seneca is not so foolish that he doesn't notice the amusement that curls the President's lips into a small smile, and less foolish still than to react to it. He miscalculated, and likely the President saw it. It's a test of Seneca's resolve, like everything else that has been set before him. ""I can have your payment rescinded and returned to you from her winnings,"" says the President, and he is definitely amused, but while it rankles like rubbing velvet against the grain, Seneca does not take the bait. ""That will not be necessary, sir,"" Seneca says, holding himself straight, his shoulders back. ""Instead I would beg your indulgence for something else."" ""Oh?"" One pale eyebrow lifts. ""And what is that?"" ""I assume she's to be punished for her insolence."" ""Indeed. A direct assault on a Gamemaker is enough to order her execution, if you want to push for it."" Seneca smiles. He cannot have her, he sees that now - he never could, because Johanna Mason will not be tamed. She will never be his; he will never know the joy of taking her to pieces and putting her back together in a way that teaches him to honour him, fear him, love him. She cannot be won, but she can and will be broken. ""Let me choose the punishment instead,"" Seneca says. ""And once it's done, let her know exactly what she did to deserve it, and give her as many years as fate allows to ponder that decision."" ""My, my,"" says President Snow, cocking his head, and for the first time he looks at Seneca with the first spark of something that might, in time, develop into respect. ""Seneca Crane, I believe I'm beginning to see the full weight of your potential."" The Mason home burns while its Victors is called away for an engagement; the fire is Capitol-made, manufactured to continue even after the house and its occupants have long been consumed, so that when Johanna returns it's to the smoke and the crackle and roar of the bonfire. It dies instantly when she shrieks and flings herself toward the flames in a predictable attempt to turn the fire of execution into her own pyre, and she's left with the whisper of wind through ashes. Seneca watches from his seat in the hovercraft, hovering invisibly above the house, as Johanna sinks to her knees before the single white sheet of paper that sits, pristine, amid the blackened rubble. The cameras zoom in on her shaking hands, the slump of her shoulders as she reads the legal document absolving her of any duty as social companion in the Capitol from here on, for the rest of her natural life. She traces her fingers over the elegant swoop of Seneca's signature - handwritten, no secretarial stamps for something this crucial - before she flings it away and turns her face to the sky, just as she did at the end of her Games, only this time it is not mad triumph that tears the screams from her mouth. It's not beneath his fingers that Johanna Mason breaks, but it's by his hand all the same. Seneca Crane is nothing if not practical, and instead of caressing her skin he lets his fingers brush the white rose in his lapel. A gift from the President, a token of his esteem, like the piece of paper in Seneca's breast pocket appointing him to apprentice under the Head Gamemaker with the intent of taking over when he retires after the 70th. And all because of the girl who rages below him. Seneca would have given her everything, anything she wanted, once he'd made her his, but now he gives her what he can: the greatest lesson she will ever hope to learn, and all the years she will ever have to feel it. Below him, Johanna smears her face with soot and flings curses at the sky, and Father was right. She is even more beautiful now. ""Home, Dietrich,"" Seneca says to the pilot, and switches off the screen."
310,1,28,1-Lorata-28.txt,hunger-games,Lorata,"When you're thirteen, after the physical and the death list and the weapons test, the trainers put you in a room with a small furry creature. It looks up at you with big, dark eyes, too stupid to know you're going to hurt it because it's lived in a cage its entire life behind hand-fed so that it trusts humans and won't run away. The point of the test isn't to spend half an hour trying to chase a panicked squirrel around as it bounds from wall to wall. The trainer stands in front of you with a clipboard. ""Your final test —"" he starts to say. Before he can finish his sentence, you grab the squirrel, snap its neck in your hands, and toss the still body onto the floor before it can start to cool. ""Done,"" you say. ""Can I move into the dorms now?"" The trainer presses his lips thin. ""There's a week waiting period —"" "" Now ,"" you say, and the words curl into a snarl. A pause, then the trainer sighs. ""As long as the paperwork's in order,"" he says, ""then I suppose you can move in tomorrow."" He signs the papers the next morning, and the less you think about that night, the better. You can't remember the last time you cried — or rather, you can't tease it apart, all those nights blur together in a mix of helpless rage and despair — but you remember this one because it makes no sense. You're in the Centre office with the Head Trainer and another as witness, and you sign your name on the thick white paper and you say the oath with your fist over your chest, and everything is exactly how you thought it would be. The Head Trainer smiles and hands you a brand new uniform, folded in crisp lines, and tells you that someone will show you to your new room. ""Does it lock?"" you burst out. That's not what you're meant to say, you're supposed to say thank you and it's an honour and I'll do my district proud , but oh well, too late now. He blinks. ""Your room? Yes, of course it locks."" That's when you cry. The next few years are good. You don't have to be the best, just good enough to stay, and that's not hard. You're strong and you're smart and you're fearless; there's nothing anyone can do to you that's worse than what you've already seen. You don't make friends, but that's okay because you're not meant to. You don't have to worry about anyone touching you because they keep the boys away and there are plenty of other girls to kiss for those who want to, they don't need to pester the stuck-up bitch who doesn't talk to anyone. The trainers sigh at your acting scores, but you're done acting, done pretending and saying what other people tell you to and nothing is going to change that. And so they sigh, but your combat skills are top shelf and your kills have the highest rating in your year, and that's what matters. Besides, the boys don't have to act, every other male tribute from Two is a stony-faced behemoth who barely says a full sentence in one go, so it really is pretty hypocritical to demand that the girls all be excellent at showmanship. It's good until one day in the winter of your senior year, when a group of you are talking during free time, the kind of conversation that's low and half-whispered while you all look around to make sure the trainers aren't listening. One of the girls tells you about District 1, about the rumours of what they have to do to pay back their win. You listen and a cold, creeping horror spreads through you, freezing you from the inside out. ""I'd die if that happened to me,"" says another. ""Can you even imagine? There's no going back from that, how could anyone ever get over it?"" ""I know I couldn't,"" says a third. ""It would ruin every relationship after that forever. Nobody wants to be with someone with that kind of trauma, it's too much pressure, and no guy wants damaged goods anyway."" ""I'd rather die than be a victim for the rest of my life,"" says the second, tossing her curls for emphasis. For a second the world turns white and shifts beneath you, but you dig your nails into your palm and everything settles. ""Me too,"" you say, and they all glance at you, surprised. They probably didn't realize you were even listening, since you never talk during free time. When your name appears on the Volunteer list three days later, you're smart enough to recognize the sign. You should be scared, probably, or worried, or pressured, or something, but instead all you feel is peace and calm, maybe for the first time in your life. Six more months, you think, standing there in silence while the others shout and cheer, and some clap you on the back and some glare at you and some stand in the corner and whisper. Six more months and this will all be over for good. You cross the square and climb the stairs and stare out at the crowd as the escort swoops in with the microphone and a flurry of glitter loosed from her hair. You wonder if he's out there, watching, what he's thinking as he looks at your image projected on the giant screen off to the side. If he'd be proud, or angry, or frightened. If he'd even recognize you at all. ""What's your name, dear?"" the escort titters. ""Sloane,"" you say, loud and strong and clear. Your voice bounces back to you from the wall at the back of the square, and you raise your head and bare your teeth for the cameras. You are Sloane, of District 2. The name Sloane means warrior, and Sloane will never be afraid again."

A few weeks in, Laverna stays late and takes him to the cafeteria while the older kids are eating. ""They'll need to get used to seeing you eventually,"" she tells him, and Claudius swallows hard but holds himself up straight. ""I'll wait here while you get your food."" He knows it's a test, to see how he handles being surrounded by thirteens and fourteens and fifteens and sixteens - not the Seniors, they're kept separate from everyone else - and if he starts crying. He's not going to panic. Claudius waits in line like he's not half the size of the next kid in front of him and lets the lady fill his try. He's almost back to his table when a bigger kid - one of the fourteens at least, he has two red beads on his bracelet and Claudius knows what that means - gets in Claudius' way. ""I've heard of you,"" he says, crossing his arms. ""You're the kid so crazy not even the homes will take you."" Claudius narrows his eyes. He knows what she would want him to say - ""excuse me"", or ""please let me through"" - but this isn't her house, this is the Centre. ""You're in my way,"" he says. He's careful not to make it snotty, just a statement, because it is. ""Is it true, though? That your parents didn't want you and all the foster homes didn't want you and the orphanages too? That's some deep shit right there."" Claudius wonders if they resent him because he's an exception, and the Centre almost never makes those. His breathing quickens, not because he's scared, but because Laverna is watching, and this might not have started out as a real test but it sure is now. If he makes the wrong answer they might send him away again. The Centre is letting him live here, sure, but that's only as long as he's good enough to stay in the Program. Claudius looks up at the boy and keeps his face calm. ""You've got a red bead,"" he says, which is clear enough. You've killed people . He's not supposed to know that, not at seven, but it's impossible to live here early and not pick up stuff. Anyway, it's a good thing. Whatever the rumour mill says Claudius has done, it won't be anywhere near as bad as what that kid did to earn that bead. ""Yeah,"" he says, and he leans down, getting in Claudius' face while still looming over him, and Claudius hates big kids sometimes. He thinks of the big kids in the orphanage and how they thought they were so great just because they were taller. When Claudius is taller he won't be like that. He'll be nice to the littler kids, at least until they stop deserving it. ""And you know what? My Ma cried when I left for residential. I heard yours paid the Centre to take you away. You might think you're hot shit just because you're here early, but you know what that means? It just means you're so fucked up nobody wants you, and that makes you more fucked up than everybody else here already. By the time you get out of here, they're gonna have to put you down."" Claudius drops his tray and lashes out before he's finished thinking, feeling the crunch of bone under his fist. The boy falls - nobody ever expects a seven-year-old to fight them really, just like she didn't expect him to pick the lock on her bedroom door and stand by her bed with a knife asking why'd you lock me out mom, are you scared of something mom , just like the Home people didn't think he would hit back when they brought out the belt, and they're all just stupid, stupid, stupid - ""That's enough, Claudius,"" says Laverna, and Claudius freezes instantly at the command. He blinks, and there's blood on his hands and on his teeth and the bigger boy is moaning on the floor and Claudius isn't sorry, he isn't sorry at all. He knows what dangerous injuries look like, and this isn't one of them. A couple of days and he'll be fine. ""Ha,"" says another boy, and he has three orange beads but no red ones which means he's still thirteen, animals but no people yet. ""Man, I was gonna get on Dart's case for thinking picking on a seven makes him a big man, but uh, I think he got the message."" He flings an arm around Claudius' shoulders, and Claudius is still tense from the fight but this kid, at least, doesn't look like he means trouble. He gives Claudius a friendly smile with a dash of wicked in it. ""You're all right. Welcome to the club, kid."" Two of the sixteens get Dart up between them, his arms around their shoulders, and start dragging him away to the infirmary. Claudius looks around, wary, to see if anyone is going to turn on him next, but they all seem to think the boy got what he deserved. Laverna winks at him, then picks up her tray and takes it to the counter. ""See you at training,"" she says to Claudius, and he realizes with a jolt that she's decided he's all right, that he doesn't need a handler anymore. For a second Claudius is tempted to burst into tears or something just to convince her to stay, but the urge passes. The whole point of the Centre is that things change; the trainees grow, move on. They're supposed to be loyal to the Centre, not to specific people in it. It's time to grow up. Claudius turns back to the new boy. ""So what do you guys do for fun?"" Note: Next chapter, we skip forward 10 years."

""Remember how it felt when you fell and thought that was it. And then you pick up that sword tomorrow and you fight with everything you've got, and when you come back I'll give you a free shot at me in revenge. Okay?"" ""You're insane,"" Sloane gibbers, and she clings to Lyme's shirt and mashes her face into her shoulder and heaves with aborted sobs. ""You're fucking - that was - do they teach you that in school? Is there a chapter for terrifying your tributes?"" ""I prefer to improvise,"" Lyme tells her, and it's so good to hear the snark, even laced with delirium, that she has to swallow a delighted laugh. ""Now are we good?"" ""Yes,"" Sloane says, and she pushes away and rubs her hands over her face and buries her fingers in her hair. ""Yes, you fucking maniac, okay, you win. Fuck me !"" She gets Sloane calmed down with a mug of hot chocolate dosed with sleeping pills, and she sends the girl to bed and collapses on the sofa, holding a cushion over her face. ""Do I want to know?"" Devon asks as he comes out of Felix's room and pads across the floor to stand next to the couch. ""Friendly chat,"" Lyme tells him, stifling another hysterical bubble of laughter. ""Okay,"" Devon says dubiously, but he heads into his room and leaves her alone. Lyme lies there for a while longer, the pillow firmly pressed to her face. ""Up to you now, baby girl,"" she says into the fabric, then sits up, wipes her face, and heads to bed. Sloane stands in a crouch on her platform, eyes narrowed as her gaze sweeps the field in front of her. A few quick glances to mark her fellow Careers, another for the meat, and she's back to the Cornucopia and the pile of weapons. There's a shiny sword in the middle of it with the perfect reach just for her. The countdown clock hits zero and Sloane springs off her platform, faster than the others, and she's at the Cornucopia with the weapon in her hand, swinging round and doubling back, before the others have even reached the mediocre supplies in the outer rings. She swings the sword (the boy from Seven goes down in a spray of blood) and before she turns and cuts down the girl from Nine, Sloane pauses - just for a second - to shoot the nearest camera a sharp, wicked smile. ""Where the hell did that come from?"" Johanna demands, throwing down her headset. ""So much for that."" Lyme ignores her, hands tight on her console, as she offers up a silent prayer. Six months later the winter wind whips past the windows, rattling the panes as hail strikes the glass. Lyme stands next to Devon, her back stick-straight and expression picture-perfect politeness as she shakes the hand of Claribel of District One, Victor of the 73rd Hunger Games. ""I thought you should know,"" Claribel says, pressing Lyme's hand, and this isn't scripted but it doesn't matter because the cameras stopped at the door. ""She - your girl - she almost had me there, at the end. I could see how much she wanted it."" The blade finds its mark regardless of intention, and Lyme swallows bile. ""Thank you,"" Lyme says mechanically, and the girl flinches just a little around the eyes and fuck, no, it's not this child's fault. She played the game the same as Sloane, it's not fair to blame her. ""Still, congratulations. You obviously wanted it more."" The girl's eyes are shadowed, and whenever someone passes too close - especially a man - her shoulders tense like she wants to cringe but knows she'll get in trouble. ""I did,"" Claribel says, the words edged with desperation. ""I really did. But -"" she stops, pinching her lips together. ""I did,"" she says again, more firmly. ""I do. I'm glad I won. For the opportunity."" Lyme smiles (and smiles, and smiles) until the train pulls away, and that night she puts a hole in her wall and stares at it, fingers bleeding onto the floor tiles, until Nero appears out of nowhere with a bandage and a glass of whiskey. Lyme's learned her lesson when selection for the 74th rolls around. No more girls, no more emotions, no more making it personal. Pick the one most likely to win, the one with the greatest sponsor appeal and highest scores and all of that, and be done with it. This year it's not even a choice; Cato stands out above the rest of the boys in his class like the sun on an exposed block of marble in the middle of a pile of gravel. Cato with his rages and his attitude problem and his attachment issues and pathological need for attention and codependent friendship with the girl who's frontrunner for the year after him. It's Brutus opposite this year with the girl (Gisele, probably, she's top of her class and quarry-proud and gorgeous) but in a way, that's better. Brutus chooses his tributes on skills, not feelings, and that will help Lyme remember where she is, how she needs to be. The official deadline is a while yet, and Lyme looks at Cato's file just long enough to reassure herself that yes, she can fix this one, before putting it aside. Lyme heaves herself to her feet and opens the window, letting in the sharp spring breeze. The wind blows the curtains and brings in a breath of fresh mountain air. It jingles the wind chime, handmade and forever unfinished, fashioned from cords of tattered black leather and chipped glass beads, scrubbed clean of blood to show the original colours: orange, red, silver and gold. Lyme stares at the newest strands for a long time, then shakes her head and pulls the curtains shut."
313,1,22,1-Lorata-22.txt,hunger-games,Lorata,"you in the morning."" Lyme walks past her, through the balcony door and into the Games complex, and doesn't look back to see whether Artemisia is watching. Artemisia holds the record for swordsmanship as far back as the Centre has ever recorded; Brutus and Lyme both topped their years, but prime vs. prime with no extenuating circumstances, just a good, pure duel, Artemisia could take them both out without trying. When it's time for her private session, Lyme tells her to showcase that. ""Nothing else?"" Artemisia asks, and she's trying for casual but the gleam in her eyes is immediate and impossible to hide. ""For fifteen minutes? The trainers always told us to diversify."" Lyme raises both her eyebrows and stares her down. ""Are you telling me you can't make swords interesting for fifteen minutes?"" she asks. ""Because I'm pretty sure the girl I chose to win can do just that."" Artemisia flips a grape into the air with her thumb and catches it between her teeth. ""Done and done,"" she says, and gives Lyme an appreciative glance. She scores an eleven. Jasper, who thirty seconds ago was happy enough with his ten, turns to her with a dark scowl. ""What did you do?"" he demands. Artemisia just shrugs and leans back against the couch cushions. ""I showed them what I'm good at,"" she says, and she catches Lyme's eye and shutters one eyelid closed in the briefest of winks. Callista takes her boy down to the training room to blow off steam, and Lyme gives Artemisia a thumbs up. The boy from Six nets himself an eight, and Artemisia makes a face. ""He probably showed them a list of baby names and asked them to help him pick one, or something stupid like that,"" she says dismissively. ""Or maybe he picked up heavy things and put them down, I hear that's all the rage in the factories."" ""Hey,"" Lyme says sharply. ""You know what you're not going to do, walk in there underestimating everyone and assuming they're all just going to lie down and die for you. Okay? He scored an eight, and you don't get those by telling stories about your girl back home. He's skilled enough they think he has a chance, so don't get so cocky some brain-dead morph-head takes you out."" Artemisia slinks down until she's all but swallowed by the couch cushions. ""Fine,"" she says mulishly, but Lyme is her mentor, not her friend, not yet. ""You're no fun."" ""You got the highest score of the year and you're just going to whine about it?"" Lyme challenges, and Artemisia's eyes flash but she sits back up. ""That's what I thought. Take the night off, get your head settled. Interviews are coming and we're going to lose a lot of hours to Remake."" Artemisia salutes, albeit sarcastically, and saunters away into her room. Lyme shoots Brutus a dagger glare. ""Don't."" ""Didn't say nothin',"" he says diplomatically, and Lyme whips a couch cushion at his head anyway. Two years ago, the space between the interviews and falling asleep on that final night drove Lyme out of her room to talk with Nero. He'd made her hot chocolate and told her he believed in her, and Lyme might have spent the first months of her recovery alternately clinging to him and wishing he'd fall off a cliff but that night his words had struck a chord. She's not - expecting anything like that with Artemesia, exactly. It's just that the last night is when any doubts the tributes might have will surface. It's not just her, it was right there in the training manual, and the mentors are supposed to be prepared to assuage their kids' doubts and put their minds at ease, set them back on the path to Victory. If it happens Lyme will be ready, that's all. Lyme settles herself on the sofa in the common area with a stack of sponsor paperwork in her lap, going over the agreements and the promises and the maybe-laters. Many of them are in the 'call me once she's killed five' camp, which is annoying, but if any tributes are likely to miss the Career benchmark of seven, it's not going to be her girl. Lyme goes over the files until the numbers swim in her head, but Artemisia doesn't leave her bedroom. She's nodding off and about to give it up and go to bed when the door cracks open and Artemisia pads out, barefoot and yawning in her Capitol pyjamas. ""I'm just getting a drink of water, if that's okay with you,"" Artemisia says from behind her hand, and Lyme nods. She's scrubbed off her makeup and has her hair pulled back in a braid, and she yawns again as the water gurgles into a tall glass, blinking sleepily. She looks young, her trademark crazed grin replaced by the normal bemusement at being awake at weird hours, and it hits Lyme right in the chest. ""How you doing?"" Lyme risks when Artemisia wanders back, rubbing at her eyes with one hand. ""Fine,"" Artemisia says. ""Not having a crisis of conscience or anything, so you don't have to pretend to bond with me so I get my head on straight."" Lyme's mouth thins but she says nothing. ""See you in the morning."" Lyme waits another half an hour just to be sure, then she gathers up her work and heads to bed, a hollow dread settling in the pit of her stomach. There are a million and one reasons she wants Artemisia to win, but floating to the top at this moment is that if she doesn't, the image of Artemisia yawning in her oversized t-shirt and sleep pants, looking like an ordinary teenager instead of a killer, will stick behind Lyme's eyelids for the rest of her life. What did Nero see when he looked at her that last night two years ago? Lyme chases the thought away and pulls the pillow over her head."

Some nights Caesar drinks until the world bleeds at the edges and the faces of all those brilliant, beautiful children — the terrified ones and the ones who don't know that they should be — blend into each other. Some nights he presses the injector against his forearm and pushes the button, feels the needle slide in and out in an eye-blink before the drug fills his head with rainbows and it all disappears. Tonight Caesar hates the writers who script his questions and he hates himself for smiling and asking them anyway, and he looks at Clove — at Cato — and gives an encouraging smile. Cato, eyes shining bright and glassy from the effects of a cocktail of tranquilizers and mood stabilizers, gives an elaborate shrug. ""I think … we understood each other. We both wanted this more than anything, we always have. If she'd killed me I wouldn't blame her, I'd be happy that she won if I couldn't. I'd like to think Clove would feel the same."" ""He's dead,"" says Clove. ""Does it really matter?"" Either way, Caesar smiles and leads the audience into a round of uncertain, scattered applause. Lyme looks at Brutus, and Brutus looks at Lyme. ""What am I supposed to do now?"" they ask. ""Cato won't sleep,"" Lyme says. ""I give him enough drugs to take down a mutt and I find him out of bed, opening all the windows and making sure the doors aren't locked. Tearing apart all the drawers in the kitchen because he can't find any candles, like I'd let him have fire when he's like this. He keeps screaming at me, asking me how Clove is supposed to find her way home if everything's shut and locked and dark. I'm about to lose my mind."" ""Clove keeps cutting herself,"" Brutus says. ""Which — that's fine, that's not new, I can deal with that, but she's writing Cato's name. I keep taking the knives away, I keep thinking I've found everything sharp but the next time I see her there's another one. She's got more damn tattoos of his name on her than I thought she had blood to lose. I don't even know what I'm supposed to tell her."" Brutus looks at Lyme, and Lyme looks at Brutus. ""I don't know,"" they say. They look down at their beer, their whiskey, and shrug. ""Mine's dead."" (Time unwinds, and the victory reel runs in reverse. Clove drops Cato's sword, Cato lets Thresh go. Cato runs backwards into the woods, Thresh grabs the rock, and Clove screams Cato's name. This time the scene plays out as planned. Clove breathes her last into Cato's chest, and her eyes are the last thing he sees, sewn into the face of a brown-haired mutt before the arrow hits its mark.) Brutus and Lyme stand shoulder to shoulder in the field, staring down at the twin rectangles of dirt against the swaying grasses. They chose their mentor plots adjacent to each other, Brutus first and then Lyme's next to his a few years later, by accident or fate or some silent agreement neither of them is too keen to talk about. Now they bury Cato and Clove beside each other in the area in between, unwilling to split them up even though it hardly matters now. Lyme opens her hand and lets the spiked poppy pods fall onto the red earth at her feet. Beside her, Brutus drops the soft-tufted cornflower seeds onto his, then wipes his palms against each other. ""That's that,"" Brutus says. He thins his lips and looks over the field at the mountains beyond. The Capitol makeup his stylist insisted on applying to cover the grief smudges below his eyes is smearing now, with the summer heat. His face looks a little like it's melting, like something from a surreal, drugged nightmare. So many kids buried here, and so many more to come. Lyme presses the heel of her hand between her eyes and takes a slow breath. ""Do you think, if Clove hadn't made that speech or Cato hadn't lost his balance —"" Brutus turns his head, gives her a long, flat stare. ""I don't play that game,"" he says, his voice less a warning than it is a plea. ""Once you start down that road there's no stopping. But."" He spreads his hands. ""Part of me says yes, we can fix anything, we saved Petra and Misha and our mentors saved us and all the way back, but. This one, I really don't know."" ""Yeah,"" Lyme says. Brutus turns to go, but she reaches out and grabs him by the shoulder. ""Wait."" Lyme ignores his questioning frown, reaches back into her pocket for the packet of seeds. She steps over behind Brutus, holds out her arm, and lets the extra poppy pods fall onto Clove's grave. Brutus gives Lyme a long, searching look, and she squares her shoulders and lifts her jaw and dares him to mock her for the sentiment. But instead he only shakes his head, pulls the pouch from his own pocket and upends its contents over the dirt covering Cato's coffin. Clove's father showed up but Cato's parents didn't bother, just like at the Reaping, and the undertakers took off a little while ago and there's no one else left. The sun's sinking down toward the mountains in the distance, and in a few hours the dying light will paint the field a brilliant, bloody red above the sharp, jagged shadows of the mountains. ""Let's go home,"" they both say in unison, then glance at each other and let out an identical bark of tired laughter. A dust trail follows Brutus' truck back up the road, the flowers on the other graves sway in the low summer breeze, and a mockingjay lands between the two smooth limestone headstones and sings four long notes."
315,1,3,1-Lorata-3.txt,hunger-games,Lorata,"disposal than call his own mentor about a nightmare more than a year out, so fair enough. The kids are meant to slowly handle a release of responsibility, after all. ""But at least the damn things have some use besides causing you all entertainment."" ""I did have a dream after, actually,"" Devon says, eyes wide and innocent, and oh hell. ""You were on a mountain, calling down your pet hawk from the sky so you could fly off and hunt lions —"" ""That's enough, you,"" Brutus says, and shoves Devon off the couch. The worrisome part is that Lyme disappears for a while after that. Brutus would have expected her to hide candles in his refrigerator or his sock drawer or inside the toes of his boots, but there's nothing. A younger, more foolish Brutus might have taken this as a good thing, assumed that Lyme got all her kicks by pawning the pranks off onto her Victor, but Brutus is about ten years too jaded to believe something like that. No, Lyme has something planned — she never forgets, and most definitely never gives up the opportunity to torment Brutus — and the longer it takes for things to happen, the worse it's going to be when it does. One of these days Brutus fears Lyme won't do anything at all, that she'll only let him think she's plotting something and drive himself half-insane waiting for it while she happily eats breakfast and goes over polling data and fucks her young, pretty sponsor boys into the wall, or whatever she does in her free time. Brutus still hasn't been able to come up with anything as revenge in case she ever pulls that one. It's almost a relief when Lyme shows up at his door with another box, grinning toothily and bouncing her weight from one foot to the other. At least it will be over, and if it's not exactly complimentary to compare a visit from his closest friend to the moment when the final tribute appears in the distance, well, nobody said they were friends because they're nice . ""Do I even want to know?"" Brutus asks, but he lets her in because his curiosity won't let him slam the door, Games-damn it all. One of these days he'll be the death of himself. ""I had Victor Affairs make a few calls."" Lyme drops the box on his table and slices it open with her knife, leaving Brutus to shake off an odd sense of deja vu. ""You know, I looked into it and your stupid manly candles are really popular. They can't keep up with production in the Capitol without a three-month backlog."" Brutus stares at her. ""You're fucking kidding me."" ""I'm really not,"" Lyme says. The grin drops the edges for a second, turning almost genuine. ""I'm pretty sure these stupid candles are gonna feed your next kid for a week."" Brutus lowers himself down into his seat, a mix of emotions swirling around in his chest. Except that Lyme still hasn't explained the new package, and Brutus eyes her warily. ""What's this, then? New scents?"" ""Yeah,"" Lyme says brightly. She finally gets the box open and holds out a candle, turning it this way and that in her palm. ""Not for you, though. I got myself set up with a line of my own."" ""You —"" Brutus opens his mouth, closes it, tries again. ""What?"" ""You didn't think I was going to let you get away with having the manliest scents in Panem, did you?"" Lyme grins and hands the candle over. ""This one's 'Better Than a Boyfriend', for the optimistic lady fans. I've got a whole bunch of them now that make yours smell like roses and petit-fours."" She keeps rooting through the box, making pleased noises to herself as she picks up one after the other and checks the description. ""The fuck is a petit-four,"" Brutus mutters, snatching up a candle and smelling it. It has the same artificial scent of the mountains, mixed with a hint of musk and spice — and also, for reasons Brutus doesn't understand, makes him want to hit things. ""Well that sure is something."" Lyme laughs and takes it back. ""Yeah. So I guess we'll see which one of us has the more devoted creepy fans."" Brutus leans back in his chair, steepling his fingers and giving Lyme a slow once over. ""So lemme get this straight. You're turning this into a competition?"" She shows her teeth, sharp and predatory. ""You bet I am. Wanna make a wager on who sells more by the summer? You've even got a week's handicap."" Brutus curls his lip, and he stands up and shoves his chair back. ""Why not,"" he says, and holds out his hand for Lyme to slap. ""Loser has to have a public date with a sponsor of the winner's choice."" Lyme barks out a laugh and smacks his hand hard enough to sting. ""You're on,"" she says. She takes the candle and sticks it back in the box, then lifts it back under her arm. ""Come on, I'm going to take these to Victor Affairs. Let them sell the extras and take it as a bonus."" Brutus cocks an eyebrow. ""You're not gonna keep them?"" ""Are you shitting me?"" Lyme snorts. ""I don't want that in my house, it'll make the whole place stink. Why do you think I brought them here while I opened them?"" Brutus rolls his eyes and jostles her shoulder, hoping to make her drop the box, but Lyme's grip stays firm. ""You're a real delight, you know that?"" Lyme winks at him. ""Save the compliments for Marjorie Flanglehammer,"" she says sweetly. ""You'll need it."" Brutus gives her the finger, and when she's talking to the gate guards he sneaks a hand into the box to steal a Better than Boyfriend candle, sticking it down the back of his shirt before Lyme turns around. Artemisia will appreciate the gift, he's sure."
316,1,21,1-Lorata-21.txt,hunger-games,Lorata,"down the help, so they take it out where they can. Claudius doesn't fear death, not like the rest of the refugees from Twelve and elsewhere who scream and cling to each other and pray to the uncaring universe to save them. He doesn' want to die and isn't going to go out and do it on purpose or anything, but it isn't the idea of death that scares him. They'll all die one day, and like all Two Victors Claudius takes everything after eighteen as a miracle he should never stop appreciating. Death, no, but dying - and not just bleeding out in an Arena or torn to pieces by some sharp-toothed Gamemaker creation but crushed to death under falling rocks, suffocating slowly as he claws at his throat to make room for more air - that is different. With a weapon in his hand and something to do, Claudius could deal with almost anything. But the waiting, the hours of sitting in silence while the building above them threatened to collapse, old memories creeping around in the back of his mind - A bomb hits with a room-shaking shudder, and the lights stutter and cut out. A collective wail rises up from the crowd, and Claudius squeezes his eyes shut and rolls over on his side, pulling his knees up tight and pressing his forehead against the bar. The darkness sits on him as a heavy weight, the recycled air passing thinly in and out of his lungs and leaving him gasping and light-headed. Flashlights flick on in the bunks around him, but Claudius can't recall if he has one or where it is and he can't unclench his hand to search for it. The air in his chest presses out until he aches, a high ringing starting up in his ears, and Claudius can't breathe and the walls are creaking and they were all going to die here, choking on rubble and the dank stink of sweat from so many bodies pressed together - ""Hey, D, you're okay."" Lyme's voice cuts through the panic, and her hand falls on his shoulder. Claudius sucks in a hard breath and shakes his head, and the cheap mattress dips under her weight as she sits down beside him. ""I'm so sorry, I tried to find you but there's no organization going on down here. I've been checking every bunk for the last three hours."" Lyme doesn't need this. She has a war to win and their district to salvage in the meantime, and she's still mourning over losing Brutus and abandoning Nero and Misha and their home and everything else. She doesn't have time for Claudius needing a nightlight and a security blanket. ""I'm fine,"" Claudius grits out, clenching his teeth to keep himself from gasping. ""It's - it's fine, this sucks but it's fine."" ""Yeah, yeah,"" Lyme says, and go figure that his mentor sounds the calmest she's been in weeks while the Capitol hammers the entire compound with wave after wave of bombs. She scoots over farther onto the bed, tugs Claudius up out of his tightly-curled ball and hauls him up half into her lap like a damn baby. She wraps her arms around him and holds him tight against her chest, her chin resting on his hair, and Claudius closes his eyes again and focuses on the steady thump of her heart, barely elevated given the circumstances. ""I'm fine, boss,"" Claudius insists, but he curls his fingers in her belt and clings tight. Lyme runs her fingers through his hair, and then, there in the middle of the cries and the explosions and the rattling of the furniture comes another sound, low and soft and crooning, one that Claudius has never heard in his life despite being a tribute and a Victor and a traitor and all the things in between. ""Are you singing?"" Claudius asks. The ceiling shakes overhead, the air thick and oxygen thin, and he presses closer. The sound stops. ""Nope,"" Lyme says, rubbing her fingertips over his scalp and down to work on the taut muscles in his neck. ""You're hallucinating out of fear."" A few seconds after she quits speaking, the song picks up again. Claudius lets it carry him away, hallucination or no, and when he opens his eyes later the lights are back to their usual levels. The air no longer tastes of sweat and the metallic tang of several layers of recycling, and no sound of explosions rattle down from above. ""We made it?"" he asks, blinking. Lyme runs her hand over his military-cropped hair in lieu of ruffling it. ""We made it,"" she confirms. ""They're moving us all back upstairs in batches. I thought you needed the sleep in the meantime."" Claudius releases a long breath and sits up. ""Thanks,"" he says, unable to look at her in spite of all the times she's seen him flayed open and vulnerable. It feels different here in the catacombs, surrounded by people who want them dead almost as much as the hovercraft crews above them. ""Hey,"" Lyme says, and she grips him by the back of the neck and rests their foreheads together. ""Are you my kid, or aren't you?"" ""Always,"" Claudius says without thinking. He killed seven kids in the Arena and more in training to make it out to her, and he packed up his whole life in a satchel and followed her when she left for District 13 without a second thought. His life might be upside-down but a mentor is forever. Lyme smiles, thin and tight compared to the open affection she used to show him before Brutus died and the world exploded around them, but still. ""Good. Now come on, let's slip in with the next group up and see if we can snag something not terrible for breakfast."" Claudius follows her into the crowd of orderly bodies, and in the press and bustle, Lyme reaches over and gives his arm a comforting squeeze."
317,1,0,1-Lorata-0.txt,hunger-games,Lorata,"so unworthy when he should have known it was a test, should have known they'd save him. Now they have, and now it's time to try to prove he's worth their faith. A worthy servant doesn't make them ask twice. He starts with the pain. Pain is a tool, it's a way to focus when the brain does its best to scatter, and Brutus finds each part of himself that hurts and sends all his attention there, one at a time. This time his body responds, sort of; Brutus tries to rub his eyes and ends up smacking himself full in the face with a hand that feels twice as heavy as it should be. He growls, but his tongue is thick and stupid and won't make words. Brutus twitches his hand, pinches his thumb and fingers together in something that maybe might resemble trying to hold a pen. ""Ah, one minute,"" the voice says, and Brutus drifts and sends his attention to his fist, curling it in hard so the nails dig in. ""Here."" The man presses something into Brutus' hand. It's not a pen, it's a thick plastic tube, and the sharp scent of a marker stings his nose. Brutus flops his hand to the side and finds a smooth plastic rectangle, likely a dry erase board, and eh, good enough. ""Let me know if you need help. For now, let's try again. Do you know where you are?"" Brutus scrawls the letters for 'Capitol', though he runs out of manual dexterity somewhere halfway through and ends the word on a scribble. ""Ah,"" the man says quietly. ""No, you're not in the Capitol."" Brutus manages a frown, and he drags the marker over the whiteboard in a long line underscoring where he thinks he wrote the word, pressing so hard it squeaks. ""No,"" the man says again. ""You're in District 8."" It's probably a test, and so Brutus does not scrawl 'what the fuck'. Instead he smears his hand across the whiteboard's surface and draws a question mark. ""You died in the Arena,"" the man says, and Brutus goes cold. ""Nerve gas, very nasty, but luckily it can cause the life monitor to detect a false negative. The hovercraft crew managed to revive you after they picked you up, and once we realized your life signs were still active, we contacted them and had them bring you here."" The cold only spreads. 'We?' Brutus writes, the muscles in his wrist and forearm protesting, or maybe it's just the creeping dread. ""An alternative,"" he says. Well, that's just fucking great and not vague at all. A hundred questions flood his mind, pressing up against the front of his mind like the painted Capitol citizens when the trains pull in, but then one thought sparks through the ache and confusion and (very likely) heavy sedation and everything burns away. Brutus' hand shakes as he swipes the board clean and writes one word: 'Enobaria'. Silence. Maybe he didn't write it right; Brutus clears the board and starts over, making the letters with deliberate strokes, and the man sucks in a breath of air so yeah, no, he gets it, so why the fuck isn't he answering? Brutus slams his fist down against the blankets, hitting the edge of the board and sending the marker clattering. ""Enobaria is - with the Capitol,"" the man says finally, slowly, carefully, like he thinks that Brutus will somehow yank himself out of his stupor an manage to kill him when he can't even open his eyes. Then again, depending on the next sentence, Brutus damn well might try. ""She and Peeta Mellark and Johanna Mason were taken by Capitol hovercrafts after the Arena exploded."" After the Arena what ? ""The others - Katniss Everdeen, Finnick Odair, Beetee Latier - were picked up by Coin's Rebellion and taken to the base in District 13."" ( What ?) ""We assumed Enobaria would be with them, since she was with Finnick at the tree when Plutarch's hovercraft came to get the others, but apparently someone had other ideas because they left her behind. We didn't realize."" Brutus' breath sits ragged in his chest, digging claws into his lungs, but he forces the air through. He directs all his energy to his eyes, but as hard as he tries to pry them open, the best he gets is a slight flutter before the headache spikes in again. 'Safe?' he writes. ""We don't know,"" the man says slowly. ""The mentors from One and Two were sent back to their districts. Everyone else was taken into custody. The outlying Villages were raided the next morning and the remaining Victors taken as well. Since then none of our sources have been able to get a read on where they are."" He takes a breath. ""I feel like we're going about this backwards. There's so much more that needs to be explained -"" Brutus heaves the whiteboard off the bed in the direction of the voice. It makes contact with a dull thud but it's far too low - knee, probably, maybe even shin, Brutus can't fucking use his limbs properly right now so he wouldn't be surprised - and it's not enough, nowhere near enough. Not when the fury swirls up inside him and all he can do is lie there like a helpless fucking baby while the whole world has gone to pieces, Victors being rounded up left and right and disappearing. At least Enobaria is safe in the Capitol, and his kids might be okay in the Village, but if there's war that's not a guarantee – ""I'll let you rest,"" the man says, and Brutus thinks about crushing his skull to powder in his hands because he may as well, he can't do a Games-damned thing. The man pushes a button, and Brutus has a second to feel wonderfully pain-free and floating before realizing that he's just been dosed with morphling, the bastard, and then it drags him under."
318,1,4,1-Lorata-4.txt,hunger-games,Lorata,"worse by admitting that she's almost jealous. ""Don't pull that shit with your finger again, by the way,"" Brutus says once the station disappears around a corner. Petra had almost forgotten, but then her hand twinges as a reminder. ""You know better than that."" Petra could argue — she hadn't meant to, not really, in her Field Exam she'd done it to remind herself what was real and what wasn't and this had been an echo of frustration, nothing conscious — but Brutus is her mentor and as always, he's right. ""Yes sir,"" Petra says, and turns to stare past Emory out the window as the trees flash past. Once they're back home in the Village Brutus takes her out behind the house and fights her down, only this time he doesn't pin her down right from the start. He drags it out, lets Petra haul herself to her feet, staggering as her hip screams under the weight. The longer it lasts the less her control, and the trainers would be tutting and calling her out for being sloppy but Brutus doesn't. He ducks her blows and knocks her back with the same neutral frown on his face, and the line of tension inside her snaps. The frown breaks when Petra gets a knife in his ribs, and that she didn't mean to do. Petra stumbles back, staring at the bloodstain slowly growing across the front of Brutus' white shirt. Brutus grunts and pulls the knife free, tossing it onto the grass, and he closes the distance between them, takes Petra's hand and claps it right against the torn skin. ""You feel that?"" Brutus asks as the blood pulses hot against her fingers. ""Remember how that feels?"" He lets go, then swipes his bloody hands across Petra's face. It's warm and slick and sticky all at once, and the smell of it fills her nose and settles on her tongue, sharp and tangy and familiar. ""They didn't take your claws, Petra. You could kill every one of them in that room without breaking a sweat, don't forget that."" Brutus takes her face in both his hands, and Petra grips his wrists, fingers sliding. ""You're strong,"" he says, fiercely. ""You know you are. I know you are. What they think doesn't matter. Okay? It's just you, and me, and we know the truth."" ""Okay,"" Petra says, tears prickling her eyes. She won her Games with a weapon she'd never mastered in training, bludgeoning and smashing after a decade of fighting with knives not much longer than her fingertips. Now they dress her in pink and coo over her curls as though she hadn't fought to the death in the pouring rain with her hair plastered to her neck with filth and blood. But Brutus — Brutus knows, because he's been there too. ""Good."" Brutus pulls back and gives her a hard stare. ""And sweetheart, if you want to play with weapons then we'll play with weapons, but you ever stab me again without permission and you'll be playing bulls-eye with plastic butter knives until the Quell, do you understand?"" Petra nods, and Brutus bends and kisses her forehead before hauling her up into his arms. ""The war paint looks good on you,"" he says. ""I think we better go wash it off before you get a taste for my blood."" ""Only with permission,"" Petra says, curling her arms around his neck and letting her head rest against his shoulder. Her mentor let her stab him in the ribs and he'll let her do it again, and all she has to do is ask. Petra laughs quietly in spite of herself, and Brutus hefts her up a little higher. That night before bed Petra stares at her reflection, shower-damp hair hanging down over her shoulders, the ends curling as they dry. Her eyes catch the scissors on her desk, and Petra would say she does it without thinking but that would be a lie. She means every single second as she grabs the scissors, pulls a section of hair taut and snips right through it. The rasp of the blades against each other settles her raw nerves like a balm, and Petra snips and snips and lets the hair fall to her dresser in dark red coils. Once it's done Petra puts the scissors away, sweeps up the dead hair and drops it into the trash can, then picks up her phone and calls Brutus. ""I cut off my hair,"" she says. The words come out calmer than she expected, and she waits for the explosion. For a Victor, image is everything, and after she just endorsed that hair care line there's really no escaping notice. ""Knife or scissors?"" Brutus asks. ""Scissors. From my desk."" ""Did you cut yourself or just the hair?"" Petra lets a newly shorn strand curl around her finger. ""Just the hair. I cleaned everything up and put it away and didn't set the hair on fire either."" She should get at least half points for that last, even if she only held back because burnt hair smells terrible and never goes away. ""Good girl,"" Brutus says, and that's that. ""Go to sleep. Tomorrow we'll get it fixed up so it looks like it was on purpose."" After hanging up Petra climbs into bed, and she toys with the baby-fine wisps at the nape of her neck until she falls asleep. The next morning Petra checks her reflection and laughs out loud — half the curls have flattened to her head, the others sticking up in random bunches — then runs her fingers through her hair, grabs her cane and heads to the kitchen for breakfast. Brutus is already there, standing at the stove and flipping pancakes, and he barks out a laugh at the sight of her. ""You look a sight,"" he says. ""Can't say that's a look anyone will be itching to copy any time soon."" ""Thank you,"" Petra says primly, and grins when Brutus winks."

""Mentors never forget. And it doesn't matter, because you're going to win. You've got great odds. Your skills are solid. I have more sponsors than I know what to do with. You're going to win, you're going to come back, and I've been beating away the new Victors for ten years because the house next to me is saved for you."" Felix sucks in a breath. ""You remember that?"" ""I told you,"" Devon says, and something in his chest shatters. ""Mentors don't forget."" ""You really think I can do it?"" Felix asks, but his eyes have gone steely now, faraway and focused on the prize, not the room around him. Devon reminds himself that Felix didn't smile his way to the top slot out of a hundred possible candidates. ""I know you can do it."" Devon smiles, broad and encouraging and edged with poison. ""Just remember what I told you. You're not there to be flashy, so don't give in to the pressure to make it entertaining or do something stupid because you think the sponsors will like it. Just do your job, make the kills, and you'll do fine."" Felix nods. ""I - can I tell you something else?"" he says in a low voice, and Devon nods. ""I feel like - like I'm meant to be here. I know that sounds stupid, but I really do. All of this feels right."" ""That's good,"" Devon says. ""Remember that feeling because you're absolutely right. You're the best of the best and you'll be the best again. All you have to do is fight, and I've got ten years of top results that say you can.""

You know you're on a train when you travel through Two; this is removed, surreal almost, scenery flashing past too fast to see, less like riding a train and more like a dream you can't wake up from. Devon and Lyme sit on opposite ends of the car, each next to a plain pine box. Lyme's on the floor with her forehead against the side, and she's talking in a low murmur, too quiet for Devon to hear even if he wasn't deeply invested in giving her privacy. Only once does Lyme's voice rise up loud enough that Devon can't block it out, twisted with rage and tears and dark satisfaction - he can't fucking touch you now, at least - before falling back down. Devon sits next to the casket on the long bench, trailing his hand back and forth over the lid like he would Felix's back if he were here and needed soothing. A splinter snags in his finger but he keeps going, the tiny prick and ache grounding him. ""Here's what I didn't tell you,"" Devon says to the air, and he stares out the window and registers nothing. ""The night before I mean, here's what I didn't say. Here's what's going to happen. I'll hand you over to the mortuary department to get things ready. While they're doing that, your name will go up on the Wall of Sacrifice in the Centre. They'll give me an electric chisel and I'll carve it into the brass myself. It's not a ceremony, no cameras or speeches. Just me and you one last time. I'll contact your family, ask if they want to see you. Maybe they will, maybe they won't. Most don't, don't feel bad."" He leans back and tips his head until it thunks against the polished wood behind him. ""We'll take the car out to the field. The Centre takes care of all that, so they'll have it ready by the time we get there. They'll give me the shovel because the mentor always throws the first bit of dirt over the coffin. After that they'll take over. I'll wait until the ground is packed, and the last thing I'll do before I leave is toss a handful of flower seeds over top. I already called ahead and ordered, so I know they'll be there. Then I'll go home and find my girl and tell her all about you so she'll remember, too."" The sliver jabs hard into the pad of his finger, and Devon winces but doesn't bother picking it out. ""The flowers will start to grow pretty fast. They'll lie dormant over the winter, and it'll be cold, sure, but you won't mind. Then next spring when the sun comes back and the birds start singing it'll be blue flowers everywhere. Forget-me-nots, just like I promised."" He closes his eyes against the sting. ""You'll like it there, don't worry."" ""Knew you'd be here, so I held it for you,"" says Tobias, waving Devon over to the seat. ""You got the sample?"" ""Yep."" Devon hands over the scrap of paper with Felix's signature from the graduation paperwork, sits on the chair and rolls up his pant leg. Three names are inked into the skin of his calf in three different hands: TREVOR, ELECTRA, CONNOR. ""The usual, if you don't mind."" ""I liked this one, too,"" Tobias says absently, holding the paper up to the light to study the scrawls and swirls. ""I'll give you one thing, Mr. Devon, you know how to pick 'em."" Devon leans back and closes his eyes. ""Yeah,"" he says, probably too low for Tobias to hear, but he's got his pen and is tracing Felix's name on Devon's shin and doesn't respond. ""I guess I do."""
320,1,9,1-titaniasfics-9.txt,hunger-games,titaniasfics,"Brutus let out a stream of swear words both modern and ancient. ""We like our women with spirit."" Katniss heaved in anger and was completely unprepared for Cato's boot as he sent it into her side. She could swear she felt something rupture inside of her and bit her lip until she drew blood to keep from crying out. Cato knelt down, bringing his face directly before hers. ""Don't worry, when we are done with you, you'll be squealing like a pig. There is a lot of Nephilim blood on those hands of yours."" Katniss recovered from the pain long enough to gather a wad of spit and launch it into Cato's eye. If she was going to die, it was best if they got angry enough to off her quickly. Cato wiped his face and then, with the slick palm, landed a loud slap on Katniss' face, the force strong enough to loosen a molar. Katniss' vision started to swim with the impact and the pain of the blow to her side and she began to truly fear that she would not escape this predicament. She cast a glance over at Gale's unmoving form and she began to hope that he was dead. There was no end to the cruelty these Nephilim could unleash on a Demon Hunter. Her morbid thoughts were interrupted by a cry from Marvel as Katniss lifted her eyes just in time to see him slump to the ground. Before Cato could recover from the shock, a creature at least as large as him picked him up off of the ground and with a roar, launched him over the cliff and into the freezing Hudson River. As if in slow motion, her rescuer turned and Katniss' blurred vision was riveted by the most shocking sight she had ever seen. It was clearly a Nephilim – tall as the tallest among them and broad-shouldered, the fabric of his black t-shirt stretching almost painfully over the muscles of his chest. His blond hair whipped carelessly in the biting wind but it was his eyes that arrested her. They were the bluest eyes she had ever seen – eyes that called to mind the endless blue of a summer day, the deep lapis lazuli of a fine Indian sari. He was something beyond beautiful. He stalked towards her with determination and Katniss forgot to feel fear - despite his attributes, he did not have the edge of menace the other's possessed. She was overcome by his perfection, every cell in her battered body coming to attention despite the pain and her fading consciousness. Brutus released his grip on her so suddenly, she slumped to the ground, her head slamming into the pavement. As the world around her faded to black, all she could make-out was a cry of agony and Brutus' protests against the stranger. ""Peeta, what the hell are you doing?"" screeched Brutus as the blows resounded through the air, the end of the question soon swallowed by a thick crack followed by a deafening silence that merged with the dark fog that creeped over Katniss, causing her to fade to black with the name of her savior on her lips. XXXXX Glossary of Terms Angels: Original supernatural being who manage the Guardians and obscure affairs in the universe. Associated with goodness and kindness, they guide human beings and are drawn to beauty, kindness and self-abnegation. Example: Thresh, Rue, etc. Blood Demons: Human beings who have opted, through free choice, to give up their souls in exchange for great power.

Prim practically wailed. Katniss nodded distractedly, her grey eyes darted to where Peeta was forced to sit across from her, deepening her sense of annoyance. ""But if you chaperoned us, I bet Mom would let me go,"" Prim continued, her blond hair bobbing with her excitement. ""They sound like a bunch of dying pigs,"" groused Rye, who sat next to Prim, triggering an argument that Katniss only half-paid attention to as she felt the gentle press of Peeta's foot against her leg. Suppressing a smirk, she set her foot on his chair and wriggled her toes into his crotch, prompting him to sputter and blush from the unexpected assault as the dishes made their way around the table. ""Stop it!"" Peeta hissed as he tried to serve himself. ""Stop what?"" asked Prim, which only made Katniss chuckle with mirth, especially as Peeta's face became a brighter pink than before. Between the various tortures, dishes, and banter, Mr. Mellark cleared his throat and called for everyone's attention. ""Well, you know, it's been a long time since I've asked Santa for a Christmas gift,"" he said in a strong voice that wasn't loud but carried over across the table. Katniss wasn't sure why, but she felt a premonition in the way he stood, almost too formally given the occasion. ""But I did this year and I got my wish. Before we tell anyone else, though…"" he reached down and took her mother's hand, a gesture that made Katniss' eyes go wide with shock, ""I asked Elise to marry me and she's said yes."" ""What?"" interjected Katniss, scrambling to understand what she was hearing. ""Have you guys been dating?"" ""Where have you been?"" drawled Bannock as he ripped a piece of turkey meat and popped it into his mouth. ""I've been here! Don't tell me you knew they were dating, and you're all the way at Panem University and I'm right here and no one said anything to me?"" she spat in disbelief. ""Katniss…"" pleaded Mrs. Everdeen, trying to pacify her daughter. ""It's okay, Elise,"" interjected Mr. Mellark before turning to Katniss. ""I understand that you might be shocked. We didn't want to be disrespectful and carry on in front of you."" Katniss sat in stunned silence as everyone looked at each other in various stages of confusion, except for Bannock, who clearly knew everything about everything and was too smart to be shocked. Surprisingly, it was Prim who was the first to rise from her seat and give Mr. Mellark and her mother a hug of congratulations, prompting the boys to follow suit. Peeta watched Katniss' scowl, trying to catch her eye as he offered his father his good wishes. But she continued to stare petulantly down at the table with her arms crossed. Without warning, she tossed her napkin onto the table and got up, bypassing the happy couple as she walked to the corridor. ""Katniss, wait!"" exclaimed Mrs. Everdeen. ""It's okay. I got this,"" Peeta said as he followed her into the corridor where she was already putting on her coat and boots. ""Where are you going?"" he said, as she furiously dressed herself. ""I'm getting out of here,"" she mumbled, tying up the laces of her heavy boots. ""Katniss, it's below zero outside. Let's just go upstairs so we can talk, okay?"" Peeta pleaded but she ignored him as she finished tying the other boot and made her way to the door. ""Stop it, will you?"" Peeta said in exasperation as Katniss turned towards him. ""What are you so upset about? Dad's divorced, your mom has been alone for six years. It's not like they don't have a right to go on with their lives, if that's what they want."" ""But…it's…they should have at least told me they were, I don't know, dating …"" Katniss said in exasperation. ""Why is it that everyone knows about them except for me?"" ""Because..."" he said as he removed her scarf and hat. ""You don't pay attention."" Katniss continued to stare dourly at him, though her face softened a little, a change that was not lost on him. He slowly unzipped her jacket as he spoke. ""What are you protesting, anyway? My dad's not such a bad catch, you know. He can cook, he does the laundry, and he owns his own business…"" Peeta said playfully as he hung Katniss' coat back on the hook. ""But that would make you…my step-brother!"" Katniss said, wrinkling her nose. ""It also means we would be living in the same house,"" Peeta suggested wickedly. Resting his hands on her jean-clad hips, he brought his lips down to her ear. ""Think about it…"" Katniss's eyes narrowed before they widened, her face brightening with understanding. ""Oh...Oh!"" She gave him a bright smile before flinging her arms around his neck. ""You're absolutely right!"" Turning towards the dining room, Katniss strode with positive glee, her demeanor in complete contrast to earlier and awarded both her mother and Mr. Mellark an uncharacteristically warm hug. ""Congratulations, you two silly kids!"" she laughed almost maniacally. Mrs. Everdeen was so taken aback, she gave Peeta a questioning look over Katniss' shoulder, to which he responded with an exaggerated shrug of innocence. As Katniss carried on about when and where the wedding would take place, Rye grimaced at Prim, who muttered in wonder to herself at Katniss' rare display of euphoria, ""What's that all about?"" ""She's like the Grinch who stole Christmas,"" whispered Rye. ""Maybe she's going to carve us all up and eat us and then store the leftover bodies in the basement,"" he said almost gleefully. Prim turned her head towards him with a look of perfect disgust. Meanwhile, Bannock looked from Katniss to Peeta, sniggering knowingly to himself as he snuck a bite of Prim's sweet potato casserole from her plate and wished everyone a Merry Christmas. fin"

Peeta chuckled behind her, and she heard the slow sliding of his zipper, felt his erection slap her hard against her thigh. His thumb was still hooked in her ass, and he gave one more hard suck, biting her again before he rasped, ""No, you won't,"" With that, he plunged into her. She shouted from the shock, which quickly turned into a moan as he pulled out his length and dived into her again. The feeling of his dick widening her so suddenly was the closest thing to heaven she had felt in a long while. She felt him all the way up to her belly, the exquisite pain of being slammed into made her entire body shudder and shake. But his strokes became slow and measured. He reached around to knead her breasts before pulling her up so that her back was against his chest. He could do that. He had a long, beautiful, dick perfectly proportional, with a thick, round head and a straight hard shaft that seemed magically attuned to her body, able to hit her in the right places each time he was inside of her. She sometimes looked at it and couldn't resist putting it in her mouth, swallowing his length until it was he who looked ready to beg for mercy. He lunged upwards, holding onto her breasts as he settled his knees between hers. Katniss couldn't suppress the small laugh that escaped her as his strokes took form, becoming harder, faster and yet, when she was close, when she was sure he'd let her fly, he pushed her off of him and flipped her around. She became enraged. He was playing with her, and her patience had run out. ""Fuck you, Peeta!"" she shouted, attempting to crawl out from under him, but he grasped her thighs and yanked her back in place. ""No, fuck you, Katniss!"" he mocked her as he pinned her wrists above her head with one hand, the other grasping his cock and rubbing her entrance, their mingled juices now indistinguishable as he continued to tease her. She felt she was turning purple from anger and frustration, convinced he had asked her to come to him to punish her for staying away from him for so long. ""You knew what this was about when we started!"" she spat. ""What does that mean to me?"" he shot back. ""Things aren't like that anymore. Not for me…"" ""Goddamn you! Fuck me already! This isn't the time…"" ""It's never the time for you, is it?"" he said, his anger blinding his strategy. This time, he plunged into her. He let her hands go, pushing her legs apart as he pounded her. She cried out, clawing at his back. He pummeled into her, the force of impact spreading like a shockwave through her body, rocking her breasts, making the mattress slam into the stone wall behind them. She was close to coming, a warning that came out garbled and incomprehensible from her lips. He was sweating despite the cool air and the drops of his salty efforts dropped onto her chest like rain. Then he slowed. ""No!"" she screamed, tears of frustration and anger escaping her eyes. ""I need to come."" ""No, you don't. Not until you explain to me why you are determined to destroy my life!"" he said, his own anger causing his face to redden beneath his freckles, freckles she had once tried to count while he slept. Soft, gentle, brown freckles that spoke to the sweeter side of his nature. It was the memory of his tenderness, his utter devotion to her pleasure and well-being that finally broke her pride. ""Please,"" she gasped, her resolve gone. ""Let me come…I'll do what you ask. I'll...explain...everything. Just please..."" He dropped his head, leaving a long, heady kiss on her lips, before kissing the tip of her nose. ""Come, then,"" he said, pushing into her forcefully as his fingertips swept over her clit. Finally. It was enough to push her over the edge of the world. Her hand reached to find the headboard, back arched. Her screams reverberated through the cavernous studio, echoing back to her ears. Peeta bit her neck, swirling his hips over her, his glorious cock hitting places she'd never known existed before him. He grunted her name against her neck, sending a wave of heat though her clit, her pussy, every part of her body. Her orgasm took on a life of its own, even after he had shuddered in release over her, his face a beautiful contortion of desire, anger, pleasure and defeat. Her body rocked on until it finally subsided and took all her will with it. His head rested on her shoulder, the stickiness of their mingled sweat causing their skin to cling together. A wave of euphoria overcame her as she breathed it in their smell. After a long while, where Peeta's body pressed down into her until she could almost just bear it, he whispered, ""Why?"" Katniss licked her lips, suddenly overwhelmed with a sad desire to kiss him, to see him smile again. She wanted all these things and she shouldn't. She couldn't. But she didn't know how to articulate all of these things without violating every single rule she'd ever constructed to ensure that her life was something she could bear. It would have been the biggest mistake of their lives. So she told yet another lie. ""Because I don't love you."" XXXXX This is the beginning of a ficlet outlined for five chapters.

323,1,0,1-titaniasfics-0.txt,hunger-games,titaniasfics,"my mind is racing in panic. I've never been kissed by him like this before and felt this way. It's frightening and addictive at the same time. I feel that thing I felt in the cave, that desire to kiss more, want more. And I give myself over to it because I've missed him and I want, no, I need this. I need the way his hands are skimming over my skin, I need the way his fingers press down on my hip to pull me towards him. I need the shock of feeling his hardness pressing up against me. I should stop my hands as they slip under his t-shirt and race up his torso, my fingertips buried in the dust of curls on his chest, but I don't. When we break apart, we're both panting. Peeta struggles as I gasp for air, my body screaming in protest at the pause - it wants more of whatever this is - but I sense this moment of reprieve is something Peeta needs, to calm down and be in control of himself as well. I continue to let my fingers roam, which elicits a barely suppressed moan, his swollen lips ready to be captured again by me. I'm bolder than I've ever been and don't stop to ask why. I want something, something only he can give me. I reach up to kiss his neck and the powerful line of his jaw. He shivers and in that shiver, I feel his confusion. I don't say anything, afraid that if I do, the magic will end and I'll have to go back home and face my family's barely repressed grief. I'll have to go back to my lonely bed and dream of all the new ways I will watch people die. I want to lose myself in this feeling he's giving me. My lips search hungrily for the skin of his chest covered by his t-shirt. ""Katniss,"" he gasps again in surprise as I try to tug his shirt off. ""Please, Peeta,"" is all I can manage. He obeys, sitting up to take off his shirt. I've seen him without clothes before but his strong chest is wide and solid beneath my exploring hands. I lick his skin, my nose tickled by the hairs that sprinkle his chest. When I come upon his nipple, I experimentally let my tongue roll over it. Peeta hisses and moans, grabbing my braid and, in one desperate maneuver, frees my hair from that messy rope and buries his hand in the thick, dark tresses. I repeat the flicking of my tongue, satisfied at his reaction. When my fingers reach the hem of his shorts, his large hands descend over mine. Peeta captures my gaze with his deep blue one and asks, ""Are you sure?"" I understand what he's asking and truthfully, I'm not sure of a lot of things. But I am sure that I will defend him to my death. I am sure that I will never be right again if I lose him in the Quell. I'm sure that I've missed sleeping next to him and sometimes I miss him for no good reason. I'm sure that I want whatever it is we are racing towards. I give a silent nod. He wants to say more, perhaps to reason and protest but I kiss him again and it changes his mind because he presses me back into the mattress, the full length of him lying flush against my body. He peels my shirt and bra off, flinging them away from him and stares at me for a few moments. I brace myself for the embarrassment - don't people do this with their clothes off? My body is in a rage over his delay and I grasp his hands, placing them over my breasts. The warmth of those large hands against my skin elicits a reaction deep in my belly and the need I felt before was nothing compared to what flares up at that moment. Peeta is reverent, his hands soft and gentle against me. When his mouth replaces his hands, I can't suppress the way my body arches up to meet his warm, wet lips. My arms encircle him and our hands and lips are everywhere and I lose track of where I end and he begins. I'm no longer pinned to one sensation but flooded with the entirety of us, wrapped around each other, tangled in the frenzy to be everywhere and know everything there is to know about each other. When, inevitably, he presses against me, I know I'm ready in that way that your body tells you, through aches and throbbing and its own warm, wet speech. It's pain and discomfort but it's also togetherness and completeness. I push past the pinching sensation, to where he has taken off without me, the controlled rocking of his hips unable to temper his rhythm. I know it will end quickly - I see it in the pink frustration of his skin, the teeth that dig into his lips in an effort to slow down - but while there is something I'm running after that I can't catch, there's something else when he shudders and spills inside of me, and it satisfies and soothes me anyway. We don't say much afterwards. Maybe, away from air that does not smell like a metallic, musky version of us, when we are dressed and equal to everyone else again, we can speak of this, training for the Quarter Quell, and imitating the Careers. We can talk about overt strategies and alliances as we hide our private agendas from each other. But now, it's just us and it's oddly perfect - surprisingly so. I burrow contentedly into his side, his strong arms crushing me against him. I won't have a hundred years to prove my supposed worth but I'll save him. I'll get him out of the Arena. Because the alternative would thoroughly and completely break me."

Just after midnight, I was pouring myself the hot cocoa and setting the dishes on the table when a familiar shuffle at the front door arrested my movements. Wiping my hands on my apron, I made my way to the entryway in time to hear a loud rapping at the door - a rhythmic combination of short taps and pauses that only one person had ever used. It was enough to make me dizzy from a sudden longing. I pulled the door open with enough force to send the handle into the drywall, if I had allowed it to get away from me. ""Hello,"" he said. I was unable to muster enough wherewithal to do more than step aside and let Peeta in, as if he were coming home from a business trip. As if the moment did not merit so much more. ""You came back,"" I gasped, wondering why I wasn't howling from the clear evidence of my loss of sanity. He simply stared at me with those unforgettable blue eyes that seemed to bore right through me and see to the other end of time. ""Katniss?"" came Prim's voice from the guest bedroom. For a moment, I didn't know where to look or what to do. I broke off my shocked gaze to glance down the hallway where a tiny, seashell night light was used to illuminate the darkness because I hated the darkness most of all. When I looked back the spot where Peeta stood, he was no longer there. I took a shaky breath, barely able to stanch the flow of tears as I hurried down the corridor to assure my sister that I was okay, even if I was a million miles from anyplace that was even remotely close to okay. XXXXX The next time he appeared, he didn't knock. I lay curled on the sofa, listening to one of his favorite songs by The Civil Wars. That haunting melody must have been a beacon because soon, he was toeing his boots off, sliding them over to the bench as was his habit, long before everything had happened and my world had veered into an abyss of solitude. His hair was windswept, his cheeks ruddy and pink. He looked like he'd gotten some sun, which gave me pause. Where the fuck were dead people supposed to get sun? I sat up, unable to move any further, sure that I had gone slap crazy and I'd have to check myself into Capitol General in the morning. ""How long have I been gone?"" he asked. I tried to talk but the only thing that came out was a squeak so I cleared my throat and tried again. ""Three years, four months, twelve days, give or take a few. Sometimes I mix the days up."" He nodded, his face so welcome and warm, I wanted to sink into the unthinkable and float like a buoy out to the endless sea. But it wasn't possible. None of this was possible and I knew it. And yet… He wandered about the living room, touching things here and there. He was not a ghost. The bronze statue of the Eiffel Tower that we'd brought back from our summer European vacation was now off by several inches where'd he set it down after examining it. I wanted to launch myself at him, to ask him if he was really my Peeta or just a figment of my broken mind. I took in his virility instead, his health and steadfastness. The ache I'd been carrying over my heart like bad plaster covering a deep crack became brittle and threatened to crumble, releasing all my animal grief. I panted, trying to keep the cracks from opening and spreading further. He took the seat next to me, turning his attention towards me. ""I guess the best place to start is to tell you how I died."" I nodded, not trusting myself to speech. I could smell him - the aroma of the man I knew as Peeta, a whiff of aftershave and the very faintest smell of sweat, not at all unpleasant. Is this what my mind had chosen to conjure up? ""That morning, you were sleeping so well,"" he said. ""I didn't want to wake you up so I thought I'd go out for an early morning swim."" ""What happened?"" I croaked out. ""Rip tide. I got over-confident and went beyond the rocks,"" he said, shaking his head as if he were describing running over someone's foot with a supermarket wagon and not the manner of his exit from the world. ""They never...they never found…"" I tried but I couldn't say it. ""Find my body? No, I've been digested a thousand times over. My bones have been picked clean."" I didn't like the image he put in my head, didn't want to imagine Peeta being gnawed at by crabs and other sea creatures. ""Why wait three years?"" Peeta looked at me with those bottomless blue eyes, a look I hadn't seen in years, and my heart took a dive into the deep end of insanity. I had begun to forget what that smile was like, the effect if could have. Photos were a poor substitute. ""I had to travel to get to you. It's not as easy as the movies make it out to be."" I couldn't stand it anymore. If I was crazy, I figured, why fight it? Why fight this, of all the things in the world to overcome?"" ""How do I make you stay?"" I whispered. He smiled, and what remained of the ligaments holding me together melted into insubstantiality. I leaned forward and he quickly took my hand, steadying me. ""You have to simply want it, more than anything else in the world."" I knew that would be the easy part. Part 2 coming soon."

He took all of her, every last spasm of release that she gave him until she was soft and spent in his hands. He rained gentle kisses along the insides of her thighs and flat stomach as he made his way up her body and lay next to her, watching her eyes roll back with satiation. ""You realize I'm not done with you, yet,"" he said as he pulled her to him. She positively purred against his chest. ""I certainly hope not."" She pulled him down and kissed him, wrapping her legs around his waist so that his cock, still imprisoned by his boxers, rubbed against her moist center. She shook her head at this. ""This won't do,"" she said as she used her small feet to hook his boxers with her toes and slid them down over his waist. ""Shit, you're like a spider monkey."" He laughed as he ground into her folds, bathing it with her slick moisture. ""You have no idea,"" she said cryptically and his mind was filled with all kinds of images of her feet doing insane things to him that made his cock twitch impatiently. ""Show me later?"" he whimpered as she closed her legs so that his legs were on either side of her and his cock was trapped between her wet folds and slick, firm thighs. ""Yes. But right now, move,"" she ordered. He buckled his hips, the feeling of his cock gliding in the tightly enclosed space of her lips was so different from any sensation he'd had up to that moment. It was like he was inside of her but not really and the angle of his movement stimulated her clit directly, making her more frenzied as she clenched her thighs together. She gripped his hips to keep him in place even though all he wanted was to be inside of her. This tension between controlling his motion, all the while wanting to enter her, aroused him even more. He leaned on his forearms, moving his hips in a steady pace that took all of his concentration to maintain, while her lips ran over his neck and chin, biting and nipping him. She finally captured his lips again, kissing him furiously until he moaned with the delirium created by her wet mouth. He moved against her, holding her head as he kissed her. The tell-tale tightening in his balls told him he was close but he wanted to feel her around him. He pulled back and swiftly dug into the end table, pulling out a silver foil that he ripped open with his teeth. Sheathing himself with the condom, he opened her legs, fondling her opening with his fingers before taking himself in hand and slowly pushed himself inside of her. ""You are so tight,"" he gritted as he pulled out and entered again. Her grey eyes, heavy with lust and desire, widened as he sunk his entire length inside of her. She squirmed beneath him for a moment as she adjusted to his size before grabbing his ass and pulled him towards her. He gasped at the way her muscles clenched around him, massaging his shaft as he entered her. ""Bossy, aren't you?"" he laughed as he let her lead him. ""I want what I want,"" she breathed in his ear as she sucked on his earlobe. He ran his hands over her thighs as he slowly took over the rhythm, his thrusts becoming more insistent as he felt himself climbing, her own muscles beginning to flutter around him. Katniss held his gaze as her body began to unravel beneath him and when she came, she dropped her head back and screamed, ""Peeta!"" The sound of his name on her lips as she panted out her orgasm became too much and he let himself go also, crying out against her hair, his body trembling as he emptied himself. When the last of the tremors subsided, he slid out of her and lay next to her supple body. He deftly removed the condom and discarded it in the wastebasket near the bed, then took Katniss and pulled her towards him. He could tell she was sated by the way her body seemed made of warm dough in his hands - soft, warm and spent in his arms. He was in a paradise he never could have imagined and wanted to hold her and never let her go. He kept the intensity of this feeling to himself, as he didn't want to frighten her but he resolved, in that moment, to make it his mission in life to make sure she never wanted to leave again. As he breathed in the smell of her, now mixed with his own sweat and sex, she tilted her head back. ""Peeta, do you think we could maybe not wait four years to do this again?"" She was flippant but there was a vulnerability in her eyes that she had hidden from him with her bravado in bed. He gave her a deep kiss, debating on whether to respond with something clever of his own but decided to take a chance. ""Why don't you just stay forever?"" he said, holding his breath. He had placed all his bets on this - all or nothing - and he waited for her response. She snuggled in deeper against him and yawned against his chest. ""Okay. I'll stay.""

""Katniss, what the hell do you have in your arms?"" He squinted, not believing what his eyes told him. My breath came in spurts, my mind overrun with adrenaline and madness. I had never felt myself so transported. Before I could answer, I heard Peeta at the door of our house. He had limped his way down the stairs and made it to the door but without support, he could go no further. ""Give me back my leg, Katniss!"" he called. He was angry but I didn't care. He wasn't going anywhere without it. Haymitch stood in shock, looking from me to Peeta and back again. ""You've got to be kidding me. Katniss, what the hell are you doing with Peeta's leg, for fuck's sake? Have you lost your mind?"" I was sobbing now, struck with the picture I must have presented to Haymitch and now Effie who, upon hearing the tumult crossed the lawn, bearing a look as if she had seen death itself. ""Well, that's not something you see every day."" He muttered to himself. I could not register his sarcasm in the state I was in. The words tumbled out of me between breathless gasps, the tremor in my body so pronounced, my voice shook with it. ""Haymitch, he wants to leave me because of this…"" I pointed at my bruised face, my hysteria causing my words to tumble together. ""And I said he couldn't but he insisted and he wouldn't stop packing so I took his leg because he can't leave, he can't leave."" I shook my head, all sense of where I was completely gone. Instead I was in a strange, savage forest, alone with no compass, no way to sustain myself, no way to stay alive. ""I'll die without him Haymitch, I'll die if he goes. I'll be nothing, there'll be nothing left of me and I'll just disappear. Please…"" Here I grabbed his jacket lapel, oblivious to the look of pain and incredulity that he cast towards me. I implored Haymitch wordlessly as if he were the one leaving. I sunk to down to the winter-dried grass, hugging the prosthetic to my chest, something beyond grief having seized me, taking me with it. ""Don't go. I'll do anything."" I whispered. I had nothing left but my sobs and this extension of him and I clung to it as every tear I possessed bled out onto my face. Effie was overcome and sat next to me, holding me to her, murmuring into my ear. I don't know how he did it but suddenly Peeta was next to me, speaking to me in a voice thick with his own tears. ""No, Katniss, don't do this."" I became more undone, hiccupping and nearly hyperventilating. Haymitch tried to remove the leg from my grasp but I yanked it back to my chest in an iron grip. There was no way to pry it from me. ""Katniss, calm down. Breathe, dear. You're going to faint if you don't take a deep breath."" She looked up at Haymitch helplessly. He in turn fixed a murderous stare on Peeta. ""Leaving? Is that the bright idea you were proposing?"" hissed Haymitch. Peeta was beside himself, his head hanging, sobs wracking his body as he yanked the dried grass miserably out of the freezing ground. He could only nod in response. Kneeling next to me, Haymitch gently took hold of the prosthetic. I resisted but he just ran his hand over my hair, whispering soothing things in my ear, which had the effect of calming me infinitely. ""Come on, sweetheart. Give me the device. He isn't going anywhere."" I relented before his kindness, letting him pull it out of my arms. Peeta's held his head in his hands as Haymitch addressed him. ""Right, boy? Tell her you're not going anywhere. Tell her that you are going to stay because otherwise you'll need to order another one of these nice things from the Capitol."" Peeta put his head up, his eyes red from crying. ""Why?"" ""Because this one here will be so far up your ass…"" ""Haymitch, that can't possibly help!"" squealed Effie. He just looked at Peeta for a long moment before flinging the leg at him. ""Put that thing on and take her inside. Be very nice to her and make sure you are never responsible for letting me see her like this again. It's one thing to have a flashback. It's another to be an asshole with your wits about you."" ""Haymitch…"" began Peeta. ""I don't' want to hear it!"" he roared. ""Act like you deserve her. You are supposed to be engaged, for crying out loud. That means you take the good with the bad, even if the bad is the worst thing you've ever seen. Take her inside. Right. Now."" He took a deep breath and turned towards Effie. ""Let's leave them alone. I got some of that whiskey you like over at my place."" Effie looked at all of us, not sure where she should put her eyes. Slowly, she let herself be led away. As they walked, I could hear her whisper, ""Is it like this all the time?"" ""No, they actually take turns being assholes."" He muttered. XXXXX I originally intended this outtake to come after Chapter 32 in Good Again but then I wrote a second part and for the sake of pacing, I've decided to just go ahead and post it here as an outtake. I will post the second part on January 4, 2014 (there's a story behind that but I'll tell it hen). Anyway, I appreciate everyone's patience with me. I'll be working on another piece for S2SL and so I may not be posting again until the end of January. I'm also organizing the first annual Hunger Games Fanfic Jam.

327,1,18,1-titaniasfics-18.txt,hunger-games,titaniasfics,"that would remind him of the place he had entered. When he had ranged deeply and risked being caught by the setting sun, he began to feel real fear. He was weakened by cold and hunger, and a terrible dread filled him at the prospect of another night among those nightmarish trees. Peeta sat despondently on a rock near the lake's edge, considering his dwindling options, but his thoughts were interrupted by a shifting of leaves just beyond the tree line. He scurried between two large tree trunks, wondering what animal would make such a sound. It made sense that creatures of the forest would descend on this lake to drink, and he suddenly questioned the wisdom of making an encampment in that place. If a bear or a lion had emerged from that copse of trees and vegetation, Peeta would not have been more surprised. What greeted his eyes instead was a person - a wild, young woman. She wore her dark hair in a braid that fell over her left shoulder and had an olive complexion, typical of the natives of the seaside villages. He also noticed that she was not particularly tall, yet she carried herself with the confidence of one who could survive anything. She was regal in an unaffected way, and it struck a curiously powerful chord within him. The bow she held was almost as long as she was, clearly handmade, and she wore a quiver of arrows slung across her back. At her side was a leather bag that bulged, obviously full of game. Peeta decided that, if he had any chance of escaping death in this forest, he would have to make himself known. Emerging slowly from the behind the trees, hands raised in an effort to appear less threatening, Peeta showed himself to the young lady. ""Lady, if I may…"" No sooner had he uttered the first syllable of his greeting but the bow that the girl carried was cocked and armed with an arrow pointing directly at his chest. Peeta blanched, expecting the arrow to make good on its promise to his body. A rush of fear froze his heart in place. However, all that was forgotten when he looked into those menacing eyes. They were of a grey color unseen in all his travels - luminous and clear, with a dark border that seemed to accentuate their bottomless quality of the color, flecks of crystal radiating out from the pupil. His artist's eye, even diminished with fear, nonetheless rejoiced in the discovery of something so rare that his distraction with those eyes together with his weakness made him forget the mortal predicament he was in. So great was his rapture that he did not hear the girl when she spoke. ""Are you ill, sir?"" she said again impatiently. ""I said, what is your business here?"" Her voice shook with nervousness and fear. ""Forgive me. I am a guest of Senator Odair. I left his estate yesterday morning to walk the woods. I have since become lost and do not know the way back."" The young lady's eyes narrowed as she considered his explanation. ""Senator Gaius Odair's lands lay far to the east of here. You have wandered quite a long way, if what you say is true,"" she said suspiciously. ""Please, my name is Peeta Mellark, and I reside in the city of Nicosia. I am only a guest and am quite unfamiliar with these woods. I admit, I became lost out of complete foolishness. The beauty of the land so seized me that I rushed unthinkingly through the foliage and only too late realized my error,"" he lied, unwilling to share the true depth of his idiocy. She nodded slowly at his explanation. ""An unwise choice, sir. These woods are home to mountain lions and bears, for which you would make an easy meal."" She took in his appearance - the haggard face, the dirty but well apportioned cloak, and the clear terror that emanated like a shield from his body. After a long pause in which she appeared to conduct a mental debate, she nodded to herself before lowering her bow and arrow. ""Night falls quickly in winter. You will not have time to return to your lands. It would be an honor, sir, to invite you as a guest to our humble home. We have little in the way of luxury, but you will be fed and protected. In the morning, I will accompany you back to your friend's estate."" Peeta put a hand over his heart in gratitude. It was the custom on this island to treat guests with great respect and though the honor of her household demanded that she offer shelter to a lost soul, he nonetheless did not underestimate how great his fortune was in being found by this young woman. ""Your hospitality will be well rewarded by my patron, young lady. May the gods ever bless your home and hearth."" He bowed before her in a sign of humility. The young lady appraised Peeta further and satisfied with her internal assessment, indicated a path he had not seen in the thickets before. ""Sir, we must make haste if we do not wish to make our bed in the forest this night."" ""Please, my lady. What is your name?"" he asked as he followed behind her. ""Katniss, and my father is Everdeen. Please, hurry. Apollo's chariot has nearly completed his journey this day."" She turned and walked with a sure foot through the maze of vegetation while Peeta stumbled meekly behind her. XXXXX Author's Note: This story was written for Fandom4LLS.

328,1,16,1-titaniasfics-16.txt,hunger-games,titaniasfics,"the ridiculously high heels, revealing her finely manicured toes painted black with a hint of red and yellow flames at the tip. I extended my hand, which she took almost daintily and led her to the bed. I searched her face, hoping that she understood that she could stop whenever she wanted to. In response, she took my hands, putting them on her breasts and pulled me down to her to kiss her again. I touched them carefully, running my thumb over the nipple, which elicited a burst of air from her against my lips. I trailed my lips softly down to suckle one, lapping their roundness, savoring her skin. I dreamed of touching her in this way for so long. Katniss' hands were in my hair as I became bold, kneading one as I worried the other, alternating my attentions. She was moaning in her deep, husky voice, a sound so sexy that my clothes became unbearable. I pulled the heavy vest off of me, fumbling with my pants as her hands ran over my chest, followed by her greedy lips, leaving a trail of heat over my chest. She kissed my nipples, an unexpected feeling coursing through me like fireworks and lava all rolled together until I was reduced to instinct, my hands taking her braid and coiling it around my fingers to tug on it. The blood roared in my ears when her small hands pushed my pants down my hips, underwear and all, my cock springing free and tapping her belly, making her pull back in surprise. At that moment, I knew she had never seen an aroused man before and I quailed momentarily at all the implications. She reached out and took me gently in hand, more curious than aroused, stroking her hands slowly along my length. Whatever her intention, the feel of her skin on the smooth tip, running her hand down the shaft and up again made me wince with an exquisite discomfort and I thrust myself into her hand instinctively. This caused her to look up at me with a half-smile as she stroked me rhythmically just a bit too hard. ""This is how I like it."" I whispered, putting my hand over hers and gliding her hand up and down. She nodded and followed suit, while I kissed her, kneading her bottom, until I came close to the edge. I removed her hand from me and pushed her gently down onto the bed, reclining next to her, ravaging her mouth all the while as my hands flitted across her belly, up her ribs, cupping her breasts again. My hands ghosted gently down to her fine underwear and probed under the waistband to touch her, both of us bucking at the feel of my fingers slipping into her wet folds. It excited me that she was so wet and it was just for me. I searched for that place that the guys in school always talked about when they were exchanging their limited experiences about girls, my fingers sliding up and down until a certain spot made Katniss arch off of the bed, a noisy groan escaping her lips. I buried her moans with my mouth as I applied a gentle pressure there. I knew I was onto something when Katniss pressed her hips into my hands, whispering my name in my ear over and over while I continued applying pressure, trying not to be too rough but, having no frame of reference, relying entirely on her body's reaction to guide my movements. Suddenly, the most amazing thing in the world happened and Katniss body began to shudder, tremors overtaking her. My name became a loud shout mixed with breathless moans as she squeezed her legs shut around my hands until she seemed to literally melt in my hands. She almost purred as she curled herself into my side, burrowing her head into my shoulder. In the meantime, I felt like a giant brick had landed in my belly, the pressure of my own arousal making me physically ache. She reached up to kiss me languidly and suddenly, I felt the feather-light touch of her hand over my throbbing cock, causing my ache to become a full-on throbbing. She gripped me, again too tightly but then, remembering my ""lesson"" from earlier, she used long, firm strokes instead, her thumb applying pressure underneath in just the way that made me forget everything except her name. I groaned and shuddered with the feeling of Katniss' hands on me. I put my hand over hers so that she was pumping me, bringing me closer to the edge of the world. Her breasts were pressed against me and I kneading them, her wonderful breasts that had started all of this, until I felt the unmistakable flood of heat and release as I came all over my belly, emptying out what felt like an eternity of longing. Katniss looked at her hand with a smug expression, studying my stickiness. She got up quietly and I had an agonizing moment where I thought she might just leave, that I might have gone too far but she returned a few minutes later with a wet towel and carefully cleaned me. Every muscle in my body felt fluid and warm, the heat of contentment flowing through me. Katniss said nothing but her hands were not still. She ran her finger over my forehead, down the bridge of my nose; the small indentation over my lips to the cleft of my chin, where she let it rest. At that moment, she looked down at me, considering something. ""Can we do that again?"" she asked. ""Oh, wow, yes, always, all the time, anytime you want!"" I gasped excitedly, eliciting a laugh from her. ""No Johanna?"" she asked hesitantly. ""No. No Johanna. No nobody. Just you."" I respond with all my heart. Satisfied, Katniss snuggled back down next to me, assuming our usual position. ""Good."" She whispered as she drifted off to sleep."
329,1,17,1-titaniasfics-17.txt,hunger-games,titaniasfics,"the onslaught, he stood his ground as it tested him, pierced him, battered him with ice and snow and branches and even stones that the wind picked up from the ground and launched towards him. It was torture - long and cruel, filled with the fury of a jealous forest that would not give up its gifts without exacting blood. But Peeta did not crawl away. He hunkered down and, when enduring was not enough, he wailed and fought and screamed, like a wild beast, for his grief had made him savage. He cried out to the elements, "" Give her back to me!"" After many hours, in which Peeta was so chilled, his fair skin was nearly blue, when he had been cut open, bruised and beaten by the angry wind, all fell suddenly silent, as if the storm had never been. He had until now been cut, scraped, burned, stabbed and punched, but in the blink of an eye, he was as whole as newly fallen snow. There was no sign of his battles except for the tiny cut that had precipitated the storm. And in the thicket before him was not a doe but a girl, a girl he knew so well. She was barefoot, still in her shift, now less luminescent and instead simply see-through. She shivered - she had never in all her time with him shown sensitivity to the cold. Katniss tried to smile but in her shift, the cold made speech unbearable and he realized in that moment that she had changed. Her new state exposed her to a danger she was not prepared for. He removed his coat and, without a word, wrapped her tightly in it. He scooped her up into her arms, swallowing his happiness, and ran as quickly as the snow and her weight allowed, back to his village. She whimpered, her words swallowed in the deadly cold that threatened to overwhelm her. He burst into his home and set her down before the hearth. His hands shook and his heart stammered from fear, disbelief, and beneath it all, a joy so great, he could shout out loud because of it. He wrapped her in a wool coverlet over his coat and set water to boil for tea. But still, she trembled violently. He took her bare feet and hands and rubbed the warmth into them until, when her shivering had subsided, she flung her arms about his neck and clung to him. ""Katniss, Katniss,"" he cooed, smoothing down her snow-dampened hair. ""Where did you go? I thought I had lost you."" She buried her nose in his neck, inhaling deeply before answering, ""You broke the magic. I had no choice but to return to my people."" He pulled back to stare at her small, oval face, with the slightly slanted, almond-shaped gray eyes that he'd missed so much. ""I didn't! It was an accident. I would never…"" ""I know. But the rules…"" She leaned back and stared at him with naked hunger. ""I missed you."" ""And I you,"" he said before crushing her lips with his, kissing her with mindless abandon. He had spent a year missing her, longing for nothing else but her. The force of his mourning became condensed in the power of that one, singular kiss and they continued until both became breathless with it. She pulled away first, gasping for air. ""I wanted to come back. But the door was closed and no matter what I did, it would not reopen. I beseeched our magic makers, our elders, who could not help me, until I finally visited the Snow Queen. She gave me only one path -"" ""You are human?"" Peeta said in astonishment. Katniss nodded. ""But you had to be worthy, for the metamorphosis requires no small magic. So the Snow Queen tested you. One year and one day-"" ""I grieved you every moment,"" Peeta said, his voice thick with pain. She ran her fingers through his beard, the shaggy length of his unkempt hair. ""She had to know if your devotion was true. She made me wait and then the storm-"" ""It nearly destroyed me,"" he said, without bitterness. ""But you endured."" ""And I would stand a thousand more just like it, to have you with me,"" he said this, unable to ignore the inestimable nature of the sacrifice she'd made for him. He knelt before her and took her hand. ""Marry me, Katniss. I have no magic to offer and very little in the way of position or wealth. But I lay my life at your feet, as your servant, to do with as you wish. As long as I am with you, I have need of nothing else."" Katniss's eyes grew wide, before softening, ""We are already bound together. But yes, I will marry you, in the way of men."" Peeta kissed her, this time more gently, after which he gave in to that joy and carried her upstairs, to his mad room covered in the likeness of her, and made her his for all time. XXXXX That year, they entered the woods together to collect the holly that would adorn the home they shared with each other and Peeta's father. And like that fateful year before, they came upon a thicket of white holly, though here was no doe. They chose together the most magnificent bough, twined its sturdy branches in ivy and hung it over the bed they now shared as husband and wife. On the eve of the Winter Solstice, when the time came to cast the branches into the hearth, they created their own secret ritual, wrapping the precious symbol of their union in a cloth and sealing it inside Peeta's oak chest, where they both kept all that was dear to them. Each year, on the eve of the first snowfall, they appended it to the wall above their bed. And miraculously, it remained without wilt or decay for all the days of their lives."

It sounds unreal, but I swear to you on my daughter's life that it is all true."" The sharp intake of Prim's breath was enough to convince Katniss that her sister would hear her out. Oaths were a big deal for their people and were not undertaken lightly. And they rarely were made on the lives of their children unless there was absolutely no doubt that the truth was in play. After a moment of consideration, Katniss decided to give Prim the unvarnished truth. ""I've never spoken to anyone about those three years I disappeared."" ""No,"" Prim said solemnly, the memory of those years etched in the lines of fear on her face. ""We never pressed the issue because we were afraid...to make you remember…"" ""Well, I wasn't abducted,"" Katniss said firmly. ""You weren't? But everyone was sure you'd been kidnapped and the trauma made you forget everything!"" Prim stood up and paced the living room. ""It was in all the newspapers, how you disappeared into the woods without a trace and then reappeared, with no memory of what had happened to you!"" ""You said you were going to listen without questioning me!"" ""Yes, but this?"" Prim exclaimed, her eyes flashing in anger. ""Do you know what we went through - your family, Gale...me? It was worse than you dying because there was always that hope you would come back. Or worse yet...the horror of wondering what you were going through!"" ""Please?"" Katniss implored, holding out her hand to encourage her sister to sit down again. ""You promised."" Sighing heavily, Prim reluctantly sat down again. ""I wasn't abducted, not the entire time. It's more than that. I spent most of that time with the 21st Regiment, the Royal Scots Fusiliers."" ""Royal Scots? I've never heard of a regiment like that!"" exclaimed Prim. ""That's because they fought alongside the British during the American Revolution."" At this, Prim's face became pale with shock. ""And Peeta…"" Katniss' voice faltered as she finally said his name out loud, ""I lived with Brigadier Captain Peeta Mellark for those two years, until I was forced to leave him in 1776."" ""1776!"" she sputtered. ""What do you mean, 1776?!"" Prim exclaimed. ""There's more. Gale...Gale isn't Sophia's father,"" Katniss stammered. Prim's mouth fell open in shock, closing and opening like a gaping fish gasping for oxygen. ""Did Gale know this?"" she asked after several stunned moments of silence. Katniss nodded. ""He knew almost everything that I'm about to tell you now."" ""And he believed you?"" Prim asked as she rose slowly out of her seat again, moving as if she were persuading each individual muscle to cooperate. Katniss made to stop her again but when Prim walked slowly over to the liquor cabinet and grabbed the unopened bottle of Jack Daniels and two shot glasses, Katniss settled back in her seat in approval. ""Fuck, Katniss, if I didn't know you..."" Prim fell heavily into her seat. ""1776? A Brigadier Captain? I think I'm going to need the hard stuff because this sounds like it's going to be one hell of a story…"" XXXXX Glossary of Gaelic terms - Serachtuague - Mohawk Indian name for the Saratoga region of New York State Mo dubh - my dark one Brèagh - beautiful Mo chride - my heart Tha gaol agam ort - I love you A/N - I feel the same way Prim does. From the moment I began reading Outlander, I knew I would not easily tear the idea of that story out of my head. It became obvious, by the end of the third novel, Voyager , that this story, as with all stories of frustrated love and overcoming almost impossible odds, had an Everlark fiction waiting to be written. So, FamousFremus - being as captivated by the idea of a Scot who would sacrifice everything for his Mo dubh as we were by a teenage boy handing over his life to save the girl he'd loved since he was five - decided to give this iteration a go. It will be a multi-chapter endeavor. Please note this is a primarily an Everlark fanfiction, inspired by Outlander . It is in no way intended to be a part of the Outlander Canon. Outlander (as well as The Hunger Games ) are not ours, nor do we have any legal rights over the original characters.

331,1,8,1-titaniasfics-8.txt,hunger-games,titaniasfics,"the rocky ground did not permit the symmetrical and elegant squares of the Capitol's city blocks and buildings. Here, the town center was circumnavigated by stubborn hills and ravines, upended tree trunks and thick, green bushes spilling down from the mountainside. Katniss lay without fear of discovery because she knew that it would take an intrepid soul to mount the small hillock behind the former pig pen to catch sight of her laying like a rag doll under the scraggly branches. And there were so few souls right now in District 12, anyway. With her eyes resting shut, she caught the sound of a bumble bee whirling by in its search for an open pistil to rest on while feeding on the sugary nectar of a flower. It was a sweet image of the fuzzy, yellow and black creature taking its fill of the flower's frothy delight, and for some reason, this made Katniss indescribably happy. She trained her ears on a shuffling sound of footsteps from the direction of the bakery and would have leapt up in embarrassment had the cadence of Peeta's step not been so thoroughly and completely his. When she opened her eyes, he was kneeling beside her, his head blocking the last embers of sunset, his curls diffusing the light like a warm halo. He had a half smile on his full lips, no doubt because of the strangeness of finding her prone on the rocky ground. ""I'm assuming by the look of total relaxation, that you didn't fall down and hurt yourself,"" Peeta asked, suppressing a laugh. ""You're right,"" Katniss said in a rare display of jocularity. ""I am lying here because I want to. There's more blanket if you care to join me."" Chuckling to himself, he hunkered down next to her until he was laying on his back, staring up at the darkening night sky. The inky blackness spread behind the receding sun, leaving the silence of a quieting town and the two of them lost in their respective thoughts. ""This tree has been in my family since before I was born,"" Peeta said quietly after a long while. The stars twinkled between the sparse leaves of the branches struggling to flower. ""When I was small, I spent all winter looking for the apple blossoms to appear. When they finally bloomed, I knew winter was over and spring had arrived."" He turned his head to glance at Katniss' small but strong profile. ""Everything was always a little better in spring."" Katniss' mind flew automatically to the forest, the brisk, clear morning air, the light streaming with its own special glow through the canopy of trees. The woods teamed with animals emerging from their long winter's sleep. The easy hunting meant her family could eat well again, as good as a person could eat in the District 12 of the past. There were furs to sell and squirrels to trade. Spring brought food. And food was life in a place where it was always in short supply. ""The best hunting is in springtime,"" Katniss said. ""I hunted as much as I could so I could trade and stock for the winters because things were always so scarce then."" She remembered the fur she sold in the Hob, the curing of meat, the drying of whatever wild herbs or fruit she found in the forest. She worked herself to the bone to make sure that her sister and mother didn't starve in winter. The thought of Prim pulled at the pit of her stomach and Katniss felt she had to look away from the pink and white blossoms hovering over her to regain her suddenly fading composure. Peeta spoke, pulling her back from her descent into sadness. ""I know what you mean. I hardly ever saw you in winter. But when the little pink and white flowers sprouted on this tree, I knew the season of you was returning again."" Katniss turned her head towards him at his confession. ""I loved spring because it brought apple blossoms to this tree and you to the back door of the bakery."" ""Peeta…"" she said, the swooping feeling of grief lifting at the upteenth evidence of his love for her. When he spoke again, it was with a voice full of feeling. ""You don't know what it means to me to re-open this bakery at this time of the year, with you as my wife. It brings together everything that was ever good in my life."" He turned his head and his impossibly blue eyes fell on her, the only light she could see in a world where the sun had sunk down below the horizon, leaving long fingers of gold and violet to pull the cover of night over their heads. ""It means everything to me."" He looked back up at the branches as Katniss' hand snakes across the duvet to close the space between them, her fingers twining together with his. ""This is where it all started,"" she said, remembering how hard she shivered under that very same tree when she was eleven years old, the very same tree that witnessed a young Peeta tossing bread to a girl he'd known only from afar. She was in awe of all the accidents and travails that had carried them from the poorest corner of the earth, through all the Districts of Panem, to the Capitol itself, before winding through the treacherous hell of two arenas, and back to their crushed home again. She marveled at the mystery of how they'd both managed to return to both themselves and each other. ""It ends at the beginning."" Peeta shook his head with a happy, wide grin that infected Katniss with its secret joy. ""Uh-uh, Katniss Mellark."" He rolled onto his side, his hand gripping her waist and pulling her roughly towards him, his good leg pinning hers, the gleam in his eye twinkling with more than just humor. ""It's not the end yet. We're only just getting started."""
332,1,19,1-titaniasfics-19.txt,hunger-games,titaniasfics,"and plunged between my lips. It was my name on his lips that sent me to my feet, his shaft throbbing between us. We kissed as he led me, not to the beach, but to the muddy bank, untouched by the machines that had erected the house that brought him to me. Mud that had always been since before Grandfather Emmett and his wood and cool mud cradled my back as he laid me down, his tongue swirling a path down my torso. My heart raced as I watched his damp head between my thighs, his tongue doing things that hadn't been done to me in what seemed like a hundred years. When he slipped his fingers inside of me, I took leave of my body and mind. It built rapidly, this thing I'd bottled up for him since we met and it spiraled and carried me away, heart racing to bursting while I coiled and came around his fingers and tongue. He disappeared, which provoked a panic in me, but returned, his cock sheathed in the sheer material of a condom, and knelt over me, watching me come back to my senses, a smile that was something smug, something awestruck. He dug his hand into the mud and dripped it over my chest. With those enormous hands that I was convinced could do nearly anything, he spread the sludge and earth over my breasts, my shoulders, the flat of my stomach. The smell of fertile earth wafted up and I never imagined that it could be so erotic. But the feel of the gritty earth on my skin made me wet and desperate. ""I didn't think you were into sculpting,"" I gasped as he spread the earth over my legs. His expression of concentration melted away. ""I've always wanted to mark you in this way."" ""Mark me?"" I said, suppressing a moan as he smeared my hips. ""Yes. Mark you. As mine."" He leaned back on his haunches, studying his work. ""Who else would do this to you?"" I sat up, gathering a fistful of the wet earth. ""Nobody."" I smeared his broad chest and shoulders, marking him also. It was strange and wild and by the time I was done, I couldn't breathe. I tugged at his lips, biting his earlobe before pulling him down over me. He took himself in hand, entering me in one, smooth motion, earth and skin sliding over each other. We became a part of the landscape, the fragrant earth, the clouds and the vegetation. As he stretched me, rocking into me, he called my name, gripping me with fingers mottled by mud and paint. When he stroked my face, I felt the dirt in my hair and cheeks and I reveled in the decadent sensation. My body sped behind his, climbing with his rhythm. He pushed back my hair to kiss my neck. I watched clouds march over his shoulder, and with his breath in my ear, came apart around him, in so many dissolutions of skin against skin. ""I want to watch you come…over and over…It doesn't…end…here."" He became frantic, hips snapping as he ground me down into the earth and he came, with a shout, then a long release that ended with a shudder and his collapse. He lay over me, pressing me down into the mud bank. He ran his hands over my cheek, my neck, smearing the drying mud. But I was happy and it didn't matter. After a time, lifted himself and got shakily to his feet, pulling me up. I looked and him, then down at myself, both of us laughing at the mess of our bodies. ""Let's get you cleaned up,"" Peeta said, leading me back to the water. With gentle hands, he washed the grime off of my body and I did the same to him. I wondered if his words were just a consequence of a fleeting emotion and became frightened that maybe he would change his mind. I was shy as we drenched ourselves in the water, working the mud from our hair, after which he kissed me again. ""I thought you'd left,"" I said finally. ""I did. I was so pissed off because you didn't even let me explain myself. You ignored my calls and messages. That was really bone-headed of you."" Though his words were harsh, his tone was gentle. ""But when I calmed down, I thought about it and realized how I sounded when we last spoke. That was not the message I was trying to convey when I showed you the painting."" I absorbed his words. ""The reminder that you were leaving didn't sit well with me."" ""I noticed,' he chuckled. ""What I meant was that even though I came for the lake, the peace and serenity, you are the best part of this experience. I don't want that to end. If I leave, it's only to go back to work, to my gallery and my commitments. I don't want to leave you."" ""I guess I overreacted,"" I said sheepishly. ""No, you didn't. I was careless with my words and I'm sorry."" He slipped deeper into the water, pulling me in with him. He waded in chest-deep, and lifted me so my legs wound easily around his hips. He kissed my neck, my shoulders, my cheeks – wherever his lips could find purchase. ""I want more of this. I want to spend more time with you. I want to give this a try. If you'll allow it."" I leaned back so that my head dipped into the water, catching a glimpse of the sky, and then straightening to capture the same azure colors in his eyes. It was entirely possible that this could work and that vague happiness that stalked me when we were still so uncertain became something more radiant than the sun. There wasn't a doubt in my mind. I tightened my arms around his shoulder and leaned my forehead against his. ""Okay, I'll allow it."""
333,1,11,1-titaniasfics-11.txt,hunger-games,titaniasfics,"she whispered quietly and I realized I had said the words out loud. It didn't matter, for our love was a secret knowledge we had carried within us before the day she walked into my parent's bakery. She took my face in both her hands, her thumbs caressing my cheeks and kissed me, deeply, languidly, with the full intent of marking the moment before pulling back to gaze at me. ""Is it even possible to love someone in that way?"" she asked. ""Can something like that be real?"" I thread my fingers in her wild hair, tugging gently at the tangles I found there. ""It's real, Katniss. As real as you and I are at this very moment."" XXXXX We were married almost the year to the day that we met, right after graduation. We had a small wedding party - my brothers, her friend Johanna, who had often babysat Prim, as well as Prim herself, who served as the maid of honor. To round out the pack was my best friend, Finnick, and his wife Annie, whom I'd known all my life in Panem. ""She's a work of art, mate,"" Finnick had said when he first met her. ""How on earth did you catch someone like that?"" ""Oh, stop it, Finn!"" Annie said in that breathless way she had of speaking. Finnick was studying medicine and, being several years older than me, was almost done with his medical studies and searching for a residency. Annie taught first grade at the local elementary school. ""Peeta is quite a catch! She's as lucky as he is."" ""Thanks, Annie!"" I said good-naturedly as I raised my beer bottle to toast. ""The only good taste Finnick ever showed was in marrying you."" Annie chuckled as Finnick groaned. ""Well, flattery will get you everywhere!"" Finnick had to eat his words on the day of our wedding. I was positively dashing, not just because of the very expensive wedding suit. Katniss would finally be my wife and I didn't think there were many other things that could make me more happy at that moment and that happiness shone brightly in every thing I did. XXXXX We'd gone to the sanitorium where her mother was being treated to break the news of our engagement and upcoming nuptials. I had begun accompanying Katniss and Prim on these trips because they were hard on Katniss and left her in a depression when they were done. It was clear that Katniss took after her father because Mrs. Everdeen was an older version of Prim. She had once been a beautiful woman but now it was obvious that she lived like a shadow among the living. ""Momma!"" Prim chirped cheerfully, kneeling before her seated mother and hugging her gently to her as if she would break. ""My girls. My darling girls,"" Mrs. Everdeen said in a mild panic and I understood suddenly why Katniss' mother could not be in the world any longer. Everything, even her own instinctive love for her children, overwhelmed and terrified her, reducing her to immobility as a defense against those intense feelings. I gripped Katniss' hand as we watched Prim try to talk to her. ""Katniss has some news for you, mom!"" Prim said with heartbreaking hope. Perhaps she thought the idea of something happy might bring her back to herself. ""Mom,"" Katniss said. ""You remember Peeta, right?"" ""Yes, dear, of course,"" the wraith-like woman said gently, nodding kindly to me. ""We're getting married,"" Katniss started shakily. She cleared her throat before speaking again. ""Peeta and I are getting married this summer, after graduation,"" Mrs. Everdeen looked from me to Katniss and back again, wrestling with comprehending her words. ""Married?"" ""Yes, mom. Married,"" Katniss answered but something in her voice hardened, catching my attention. I moved closer to her and wrapped an arm around her shoulder. ""Married?"" repeated Mrs. Everdeen. ""I was married once,"" she whispered. ""But now he's gone."" She turned her head to look out the window as if she could see her deceased husband there. ""Mom?"" Prim asked, prodding her gently. ""Did you hear what Katniss said? She's getting married! I saw her dress! She's going to be so pretty!"" But Mrs. Everdeen was no longer with us. Maybe she'd gotten lost in a memory of her own, one that she shared only with her long-lost husband. Katniss sagged against me and I understood what was in her voice earlier. She'd seen this coming. She knew her mother would not have the means to give her blessing, which is what Katniss desperately wanted. It wasn't cruelty, though I was impatient and secretly angry at what I thought was her mother's selfishness at the time. Knowing what I know now, I understand that Mrs. Everdeen's soul was half in this world and half in her husband's plane and she could no more fully interact with those of us here on Earth than we could have conversed with the angels. I now recognize her desperation and illness for what it really was - terminal, soul-rending heartbreak. It was a condition that had seized her from the world of the living, a condition her daughter would someday succumb to. And it would be fully and completely my fault. XXXXX So Katniss was not only beautiful that day. She was radiant as the sun. And I was a satellite caught in her orbit, full of happiness and the monumental importance of the moment. On that day, I bound myself to her and to her sister in the most powerful way I knew how. They both belonged to me, to care for in equal measure. When I said ""I do,"" I did so with all the naive optimism of youth, and gave myself over to the illusion of my immortality. For I truly believed I would have the rest of my life to show Katniss all the ways that I loved her. XXXXX Part 2 of 7 tomorrow! Thanks to abbythebear and solasvioletta for betaing this fic!"
334,1,29,1-titaniasfics-29.txt,hunger-games,titaniasfics,"into a fit of happy tears, hugging both Peeta and Katniss with something close to ecstasy. Thom, who likely remembered when Katniss first returned to District 12 and could barely make it back to her home in Victor's Village on her own, shook Peeta's hand extra hard and smiled with satisfaction as if he'd won a secret bet with himself. ""You went and made us Aunties!"" exclaimed Johanna as she and Zarah encircled Katniss in a tight hug. ""You are so in for it now, Brainless!"" she laughed as Zarah shook her head. ""You're gonna scare that girl right out of making babies, you know that?"" she teased, making Johanna laugh, which was not something anyone often saw. ""You better be prepared to have one spoiled little child, Peeta!"" Zarah admonished as she hugged him tightly. ""You can count on it."" he said, wearing the expression of a man who was still in the throes of a dream. The boys were more muted in their congratulations. After all, they were still at that age where they couldn't decide whether girls were amazing or gross and babymaking was one of those things that was all tied up in their confusion. Tristan, George, and Frank were appropriately polite and slipped away to get back to their gifts as soon as the adults were distracted. Wesley made a better show at being mature but he, too, slipped out at the earliest opportunity. Annie's lips shook as she congratulated the soon-to-parents. ""Finnick would have loved this, if he'd been here,"" she said. Annie hugged them both dreamily and Katniss liked to think that in those moments of distraction, she was somehow together with Finnick again. Haymitch didn't even make a pretext of smugness and simply pulled his two ex-tributes to him, wordlessly inviting their new little addition into the circle of his protection. He and Katniss shared this in common - a complete allergy to any excessive public displays of emotion. But he made an exception on this occasion as he had on the day of their wedding. ""Y'all made me a grandfather after all,"" he said as Mrs. Everdeen approached. ""That is, if you don't mind, ma'am,"" he said in deference to the older woman. ""A baby can never have too many people to love it,"" she said placidly as she hugged Peeta to her. ""Thank you, for making her happy."" Mrs. Everdeen whispered to her son-in-law, as she did every year since they'd married. ""Thank you for Katniss. She makes me happy too,"" he responded in turn. It was their own private ritual, a secret exchange of affection that they indulged in each year, as a reminder of what they owed each other. Haymitch turned to a very content Rowena. ""You knew, didn't you?"" She nodded. ""I'm the one who did Katniss' pregnancy test and examination."" Peeta looked at her with curiosity. ""How far along is she?"" Rowena smiled. ""By the looks of it, she's almost three months. It will be a late spring baby if it goes to term."" ""And you didn't even tell me,"" groused Haymitch. ""Oh, no, you don't! Doctor-patient confidentiality. Inside my clinic, Katniss is my patient and her medical business is her own."" Rowena stepped forward and hugged Katniss tightly. ""But outside the clinic, it's different. I'm going to give those two over there a run for their money…"" she jerked her thumb at Johanna and Zarah. ""This is going to be the most spoiled baby in the history of babies!"" Effie was equal to Delly in the hysterical way she received the news, exclaiming over and over that her birds, her darling birds, were expecting. Oakley pulled Peeta away from Effie's effusions to offer him his own personal congratulations. ""I remember the way you treated Wesley when we first met. I've never forgotten your kindness to him. You're going to make a fine father,"" he said, shaking Peeta's hand vigorously. Peeta flushed with pleasure but before he could respond, they were interrupted by Effie. Just as she did for their toasting, she fetched champagne (and apple cider for the expectant mother) for a toast of good fortune. Later that evening, as the guests cleared out to their respective rooms, Katniss leaned drowsily against Peeta on the sofa, her legs tucked under her. ""That was, hands down, the best Christmas gift I've ever gotten,"" he said quietly, toying with her braid. ""You mean, better than last year, when I dressed up as Santa's Helper?"" Peeta blushed furiously. ""Oh, right. That Christmas is actually pretty hard to compete with."" He turned his face down at her. ""You still have that outfit? Because, you know, you might not be able to wear it for awhile..."" Katniss purred, snuggling deeper into his arms. ""Yeah, I have it but I'm not putting it on until everybody leaves. We were very noisy that night."" ""Hmmm…"" he said appreciatively, then changed to a more serious tone. ""I know this is scary for you. I promise, our baby will be safe. You'll be safe. I'll never let anything happen to either of you."" Katniss listened to his words. ""You can try, but you can't promise to always keep the baby safe. That's not how it works."" ""I know,"" Peeta said with a frown. ""But I can try my best."" ""I know you will. Like you always do."" Katniss sat up suddenly, knowing that if it was possible to give security and a sense of protection in this world, Peeta would find a way to do it. ""Let's go upstairs. I might not be able to dress up…"" Peeta didn't let her finish as he stood up suddenly and picked her up, kissing her so that everything south of her belly lit up on fire. ""You are so sexy when you're pregnant."" Katniss laughed. ""I'm not even showing yet!"" ""That's okay. Just the idea of it is enough for me,"" he said as he bound up the stairs to unwrap his favorite gift of all."
335,1,24,1-titaniasfics-24.txt,hunger-games,titaniasfics,"And send it out tonight So we can start again She stared at him for a long time before placing her hands on his chest. The thing that she had sensed in him, the spreading pitch of emptiness, had completely engulfed him and she was at the edge of darkness, ready to fall into it with him. Strangely, the onrush of grief was not sudden. She thought back to another time when she had also touched him and felt his still heart. In the arena, when Peeta hit the force field, Finnick Odair, their son's namesake, had saved him that time and gotten his heart to beat again. Remembering the joy of his revival brought on the tidal wave and Katniss began to cry. She cried for Peeta's goodness and loyalty. She cried for his torture and pain. She cried for the children and grandchildren who would think of his kindness and generosity, the patient way he had with them and miss him. But mostly, she cried for herself, for the sudden void of time that opened up before her. She searched the air for something to hold onto until she found herself on her knees besides him and, bringing her head down to his, murmured quietly in his ear. She remained in this attitude for what seemed like eternity. It didn't matter to her. Time had ceased to matter to her. A slight crackling of frost outside the window caught her attention, drawing her to the frame as she leaned her throbbing head against it. In a pool of soft moonlight, under the bow of a giant evergreen tree, stood the white stag she had seen earlier that day. He was as tall as a man, full of the pride of a creature that had seen life rise and fall for countless eons, watched fear like a tsunami drown mere mortals only to buoy them up into eternity. Katniss did not know all of this. She only knew that she would not have to dig very deeply into her heart to find her greatest desire. The terror and sadness that had plagued her during these last months dissipated like heavy iron shackles that had suddenly fallen away. ""Thank you."" She whispered, with an irrational sense of peace. The stag made a motion with his heavily antlered head, as if to nod in approval before leaping into the darkness and disappearing into the night. She reclined next to the still body of her husband and thought of all the things he represented to her – her dandelion in spring, the warm loaf of burnt bread in the rain, unconditional love - and breathed him in one more time, smelling paint and cinnamon and comfort. As if a spell had been cast on her, she felt herself sink into the deepest, most peaceful sleep of her life, her breathing slowing inexorably against Peeta's shoulder. The first thing she felt when she came out of her slumber was his strong warm arm around her. Lifting her head from his shoulder, she was somewhat confused to find the room illuminated with sunlight, the warm breeze of spring whispering against the gauzy curtain of the open window. Winter was just a memory as she sat completely up. She was not wearing her heavy flannel gown but a thin gossamer shift that looked like it had been spun from individual threads of trembling sunlight. Her exposed arms were not the wrinkled, scarred arms she had grown accustomed to but the smooth olive skin of her youth. She looked over at Peeta to see him staring at her with those eyes that she had never in her mortal life ever seen on anyone else. It thrilled her to watch his features soften and change, so filled out and young, young like when he mounted the stage during the first Reaping. Her eyes ran down the length of his torso to his legs, the signs of his torture and the shadows of flames from that long ago day eradicated from his body. He was clad in the same textured light and nothing was missing. He was whole and perfect and complete. This state of affairs did not shock her as it should. It was as it should have been, so incredibly right that she was instead filled with gratitude and joy. The anxiety and fear that always lived in her heart seemed to have been scooped out and cast away and she felt a sense of complete well-being that she had only ever felt when she was very young and her father was still alive. There were others here, she heard their gentle voices calling to her. She longed to see the host of people who had populated her heart all these long years – her father, Prim, her mother, Gale, Haymitch, Effie, Johanna , Rue, Finnick - but here was the one for whom she had always longed, in the perfection of his youth, the way he should have been before the evil of their mortal world had taken it from him. ""Hi."" she said, drinking in the solid virility of his appearance, as she had done so many times in their lives together. ""Hi."" He smiled. ""I didn't think I'd see you again so soon."" He ran his hands over her smooth cheek and laced his fingers in her thick, ebony hair before pulling her down to kiss him, a kiss that called to mind those endless kisses when they were young and learning to love. Losing herself in him, she responded, her grey eyes lighting up like a beacon, ""Well, I didn't ask for unlimited chocolate, you know."" A special thanks to SolasVioletta for working so hard on editing this story even though she was swamped in this period. She also recommended this lovely song. You are so very dear to me. To Marquise des Anges who is a far better beta than she gives herself credit for. Your suggestions and support were invaluable!"
336,1,21,1-titaniasfics-21.txt,hunger-games,titaniasfics,"and don't deserve? You've always done that."" He reached out his freezing hand towards her, brushing her arm lightly, but visibly stopped himself and pulled back, his intention hanging suspended in the humid air between them. Katniss had to repress a cry at the loss of his touch, the ghost of his fingers still lingering on her skin. ""P-Peeta,"" she choked out. ""When you left, Haymitch said I could live a hundred life times and never deserve you. I always thought he was on to something."" Peeta shook his head violently to stay her words. ""I think I get to decide what I deserve, what I want, what I need ,"" he emphasized, and to Katniss' surprise, the half smile returned, but this time, there was less bitterness in it. ""Especially when you want the same thing as I do, and you're just being too stubborn and pigheaded to admit it."" Peeta leaned towards her, shivering but holding his ground, his eyes still burning, and Katniss felt like she was being consumed. ""I'm so sorry I ruined your wedding,"" she whispered abruptly, attempting to distract him away from talk of feelings. Peeta frowned at this. ""Delly took the entire church to the reception. She told me she did her best. She said she gave it her all and her conscience was clear and she was going to celebrate, because it was already paid for and she wasn't going to let me ruin it,"" he said in admiration but also with an edge of guilt that had not been, however, strong enough to keep him from coming to Katniss' door. He reached out again, and this time, he didn't let go of her arm. ""Anyway, that's not the point,"" he said with determination, kneading the soft flesh of her forearm. ""I'm here to tell you that I love you, and I don't care what you are willing to give me, if you want to live with me, marry me, be my girlfriend; I honestly don't care. Because I'm not making this mistake again. I'm not going to keep looking for someone else to take the place of you."" ""Can't we talk about this inside?"" Katniss pleaded as she watched him shiver from being in cold, wet clothing. But Peeta shook his head, giving her a look that told her she'd asked the wrong thing and continued to stare at her, the clouds of doubt gathering in his eyes the longer they held this impasse and she knew that she'd have to do something to get him to move. She couldn't bear to see him suffer any more and she couldn't bear her own impatience to have him finally in her arms again. ""I'm stubborn and stupid and pigheaded and I'm sorry. I will never understand what you see in me."" She reached out to him and pulled him towards her, wrapping her arms around his waist, feeling the icy rain penetrate through the thin material of her pajamas, but he didn't budge, his face still impassive. She knew it wasn't enough and tried again. ""I was stupid, beyond stupid two years ago. I should have been honest with you about my fears. I...And I should have fought for you when you left. I should have known-n…"" She paused, choking up, and noticed the way the light had rekindled in his eyes, giving her the strength to continue talking. ""I should have known I couldn't let you go, anymore than it seems you could me. That I need you. I need you so much, Peeta."" It was only then that Katniss realized that tears were flowing down her face. Peeta's arms came up around her, but she still saw a hesitation in his eyes, a sliver of uncertainty, and she quailed again, wishing she were better with words than she was. He brought a hand up to caress her cheek, and Katniss sighed at the touch. ""Please, just tell me,"" Peeta whispered so softly she was amazed she could hear him over the rain. He shivered again with cold and longing. ""Tell me and I'll stay. You love me, real or not real?"" Katniss scowled at the question for just a moment, but then she felt a sense of relief so profound, she thought she'd faint from it. She reached up to brush the wet wave of hair off his forehead before cupping his face with her hand in a mimic of his own. ""You're an idiot, and there's nothing I can do about it but..."" She gave him a soft smile. ""Real. So very real."" She stifled a sob as she saw his face finally soften, and wrapped her arms around him. ""I love you. I love you so much. You're right about everything. Just come inside. Stay."" She gripped his tuxedo, pulling him even closer. ""Please stay,"" she begged. Peeta sighed, the tension of years of pent up frustration draining away as he clutched her to him, pinioning her to his chest with freezing wet arms. ""Always,"" he whispered into her hair before tilting her head up to kiss her, so gently, Katniss could only sigh against his lips. He leaned back to study her when he was done, brushing a wet piece of hair off her cheek. ""I'm not going anywhere,"" he said in a half-joking, half-serious manner. ""So next time you decide to send me away, you better be ready to move to Antarctica, because you won't be getting rid of me, whether you like it or not. Okay?"" He hugged her to him again. Katniss nodded, surreptitiously wiping her tears against his icy chest, and tugged him as he stepped over the threshold, back home where he belonged. XXXXX This was such a pain to write! I want to thank my prereaders, mitchesbcray, dandelionlass, madambeth and peetabreadgirl.

337,1,23,1-titaniasfics-23.txt,hunger-games,titaniasfics,"surprise. ""Really? You pervert!"" she laughed. ""A regular creep."" I whispered as I kissed her neck, satisfied when I felt her shiver from the contact. We danced for a while longer while the glow from the candles and the warm fire combined to make us feel as molten as the warm chocolate. I led her wordlessly to the pile of pillows and blankets where we drank a bit of the warm chocolate before she positioned her head on my lap. I opened up what had lately become my favorite book, smoothing her hair with one hand as I read with the other. I was nervous - I hoped she wouldn't find it trite for me to read to her. Like me, not everything made sense - the poem was so very old: Let me not to the marriage of true minds Admit impediments. Love is not love Which alters when it alteration finds, Or bends with the remover to remove: O no! it is an ever-fixed mark That looks on tempests and is never shaken; It is the star to every wandering bark, Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken. Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks Within his bending sickle's compass come: Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks, But bears it out even to the edge of doom. If this be error and upon me proved, I never writ, nor no man ever loved. Katniss was staring at me enraptured. ""I could listen to you all day."" she whispered. ""You said something like that in the woods."" ""You really understood this poem that quickly? I had to read it at least eight times before I got it."" I said in astonishment. ""Not every word. But it makes sense to me."" She pulled the poem over to her, scanning it for a moment, running her fingers under each line. ""There's no reason why two like-minded people should not be married. Love doesn't change when circumstances change, or when the person you love is gone. No. It's like a fixed point that sees storms but doesn't waver. Love is the star for every wandering…"" she paused with a twinkle in her eye, ""...ship. It has great value though it can be measured. Love is not at the mercy of time though physical beauty is its victim. Love doesn't change with hours or weeks but lasts to the end of time. If I am wrong about these thoughts, then I recant everything I've written and no one has ever really loved."" she smiled in satisfaction. ""You're tricking me. You've seen this before!"" I accused, astounded by her understanding. ""Why does it surprise you that I would understand that? Do you think I'm dumb?"" she accused in a dangerous tone. ""No, I just, I didn't think you really, well, I thought this might be a little too fluffy for you."" I stuttered. Katniss made an impatient face. ""My father sung all kinds of songs to us. I'm out of practice but I can figure out a poem. Plus all the harder words are explained at the bottom."" I was in awe of her yet again. ""You always find new ways to amaze me."" She became serious. ""Think what you would have missed if you'd have gone away. You'd just be handing another victory over to the Capitol. We can't have that. Not anymore."" ""I won't ever go away. I promise."" I said, my voice becoming thick with emotion. ""This poem made me think of us. How we should not put impediments on what we feel."" I bent to kiss her but she pulled back. ""Read one more."" she fairly purred. ""You're so sexy when you read to me."" I pulled her onto my lap and held the book up for the last poem. You are such a good cook. I am such a good cook. If we get involved we'll both get fat. Then nobody else will have us. We'll be stuck,two mounds of wet dough baking high and fine in the bed's slow oven.**** Katniss threw her head back in heady laughter, a sound more beautiful than the soft melody playing in the background. ""No, that's it! That's us!"" She crawled up over me, pushing the book aside, giving me a deep kiss that tasted of melted chocolate. ""You like that one the best, don't you."" I teased, marveling at how she could set me alight with the smallest gesture. ""You are so profound."" ""That I am."" she kissed me again, this time more earnestly. ""Show me how our little nest works because right now, I want to bake high and fine with you."" We both laughed as she dragged me down onto the piles of soft, warm blankets.

Why'd you leave like that?"" said Peeta as she snatched her keys out of his hand. ""I told you. Prim has to be somewhere."" she said as she continued to fumble with the key, her frustration making her even clumsier than usual. ""No she doesn't. Doesn't she have dance until 7 today?"" he responded and her fumbling got so bad, she dropped her keys on the pavement. ""I need to go, that's all."" she said, not bothering to lie anymore. Peeta bent down to pick up her keys and looked up, seeing her face for the first time. ""Katniss, why are you crying!"" He straightened up and took her by her shoulders. ""Are you okay? Is it your mom?"" ""No, Peeta! Just leave me alone!"" Katniss tried to break away but he held her firm. ""I'm not going to leave you alone! I remember the last time you cried!"" He didn't want to bring up her father's funeral but they both knew she never cried. He softened his voice which only made her more miserable. It would have been better if he were a jerk - it would have made not being able to have him less painful. This line of reasoning made her want to cry even harder and she yanked herself out of his grasp, managing to get the key in the keyhole. Peeta wasn't having any of this. As she made to open her car door, he pressed it shut and turned her around, doing something that shocked both of them, the consequences of that small act reverberating like an underwater tsunami for years of their lives afterwards. Pressing her against her car, he brought his lips down and kissed her gently, a simple gentle sweeping of his lips against hers so incongruous with the force with which he'd turned her around. Without pulling back completely, he simply stared at her, waiting for her to confirm whether this was going to be the best or worst moment of his life. Something hungry began to claw its way up inside of Katniss and, without thinking, she bridged the space between them, kissing Peeta back with a hunger that caught them both by surprise. Her mouth parted slightly and his eager tongue sought hers out. Soon they were exchanging a deep, heated kiss in the middle of that mall parking lot on a late spring evening. Something in the kiss recalled the day of the Valley Song, that shift in the air that signaled the creation of something as profound as the bonds that held together the very molecules of air themselves. When they broke apart, Peeta's eyes had become unnaturally bright, the pupils devouring the deep sky-blue and Katniss knew he wanted more. They both wanted more. But she had one thing to clear up. ""Are you going to Prom with Delly?"" She whispered, fear dripping from her words. Peeta pulled back in confusion. ""Wha-? No, god, no! What gave you that idea? You mean...is that what you thought?"" He smiled at this, which lit a fuse of anger inside of Katniss. ""Is that what you thought back there? That Delly was my date to Prom?"" He chuckled and in her humiliation, she pushed against him. ""That's not why I ran away!"" She all but screeched. Peeta pulled her towards him, pinning her to the car with both hands on either side of her, keeping her from escaping. ""Yes it was. You were jealous."" Understanding dawned on him as he said this, and he lost the look of mirth, his face becoming serious. ""Katniss, I'd never take anyone else to Prom. I wanted to ask you but I couldn't get the nerve up. We've been friends for so long, I don't want to ruin what we have."" Katniss' body went deathly still and yet there was a humming in her belly that was beginning to overwhelm her - a trembling expectation that would soon make her body react in indescribable ways. ""You want to go to Prom with me?"" she asked nervously. ""What about Delly? It looked like you two were going dress shopping."" ""No, Katniss! She's going with Thom! I bumped into her outside of Nieman Marcus and we just started walking together, I promise!"" He said with some vehemence. ""I..."" he stuttered at this, a flush pinking his cheeks, ""I only want that with you."" He whispered. ""What, Peeta? What do you want with me?"" Katniss asked, her eyes staring hungrily at his lips. She had no idea how arousing the look on her face was to him and he became physically uncomfortable that his growing desire would be so easily visible to her. Instead of answering her, he closed the space between them and kissed her again, this time moving his soft lips gently against hers, nipping at her bottom lip playfully before deepening the kiss. He pressed his body into hers and she felt his desire rub up against her, eliciting a gasp from her. ""I don't want to just take you to Prom. I want to be with you. I don't know when I started feeling this way - I think maybe I always have - but I want you to be my girl, Katniss."" He watched her closely, measuring her reaction. Katniss was stunned, her mouth half-hanging open. She had the sense to close her mouth before the most beautiful shy, smile Peeta had ever seen in his life lit up her face. ""Really? Me? Not Delly?"" she said, still amazed and yet, she'd somehow always known it would be this way. ""No, not Delly or anyone else. Only you."" he drew in a ragged breath. ""It's always been you. Please Katniss, do you allow it?"" he pleaded, his hand having dropped to rest on her hip. Katniss' smile widened - she didn't care that she hardly ever smiled because it made each one she gave him more special. ""Yes, I allow it."""
339,1,10,1-titaniasfics-10.txt,hunger-games,titaniasfics,"trapped. She'll never have a full life."" Peeta could think of nothing to say to this. It was the way things were in their land. Caste was destiny and they were all trapped. There was no real freedom except the one he felt at that moment, sitting on that rocky outcropping, the whisper of winds and breezes ruffling through his hair, birds and insects calling at their backs. ""I'd be an artist, a painter maybe, if I weren't here,"" whispered Peeta. Katniss tilted her head to look at him and gave him a small smile, her eyes full of compassion. Without thinking, Peeta reached out his fingers to brush Katniss', in solidarity and comfort. He was surprised when she quickly captured his hand and threaded her fingers through his. She turned her face to observe the emerald-green foliage of the late spring forest as he stared at her profile, wondering how he had lived without this kind of beauty for so long. They sat in this way for a long while, taking in the peace of the forest that knew no boundaries or social class before returning quietly back to the fence. ""I'll be back here tomorrow,"" said Katniss in parting before running off towards her section of the Seam. Peeta simply stood, watching her receding figure with perhaps the happiest smile he'd ever worn in his life. XXXXX They met as often as they could at the edge of the fence. Sometimes it was difficult, because of the bakery or Katniss' mother and sister. They sometimes needed help with patients, as they were the only healers that other very poor Untouchables and Laborers could afford. The town physician, Dr. Abernathy, was too far out of their reach. Katniss and Peeta devised a system to alert each other if they were free to meet that day - Katniss wore a green sprig of white fir or some other evergreen on her lapel when she came to the back of the bakery and Peeta sported the orange ribbon tied like a bow over the strap of his apron. His brothers made fun of his decoration but he simply explained that it was for good luck, which only brought on more teasing. One day at the lake, Katniss took Peeta by the hand and showed him her secret place ""My father used to bring me here when we came to fish,"" she explained as they walked directly into a tangle of brush. Peeta wondered what could be hiding in that thick bramble of thorns and vines but Katniss knew her way. After walking for a few hundred feet, they came upon an old, somewhat decrepit one-room cabin, buried in a copse of dense trees. Inside was a small hearth filled with dried leaves and other detritus. The table and bench had been built directly into the wall. On the far side of the room was an elevated frame to place a mat or a bed. ""I haven't been here in a while, ever since Gale started working in the mines,"" said Katniss quietly. Though Gale was technically of the same caste as Katniss, he was young and strong so he had found a place working in the mines. There was always room for more able-bodied men and it was one of the very few professions an Untouchable could work. Peeta stood in the middle of that humble building, taking in the small windows, the dusty spiderwebs, and the musky smell of earth while an unfamiliar feeling crept over him. He suddenly felt awkward and vaguely miserable. ""Are you and Gale...you know…a couple?"" Katniss' eyes went wide. ""No! He's like a brother to me. I don't have those feelings for him."" ""Oh, okay, I was just curious. I don't want to get a beating or anything,"" he trailed off, feeling like an idiot. Katniss said nothing, but her eyes, already dark from the dim light, became almost black with an intensity that filled Peeta with a strange expectation. ""I wouldn't let anyone beat you,"" she said quietly. She stepped towards him, wrapped her arms around his waist, and melted into him. She trembled slightly, the reverberation of her body spreading like ripples from a pebble cast across a lake. Peeta did not waste any time responding in kind, pulling her slender body against his. When she leaned back slightly to look up at him, he saw her undisguised need, her open vulnerability before him. He brought his lips down to kiss her, a lingering pressure against the soft skin that felt like he was sinking into a cloud. When he pulled back, he studied her face for a reaction. She stared back unabashedly, in a way she never did when they spoke, her mouth falling slightly open. When Peeta kissed her again, he tasted all the things he had associated with her - spring and beauty and the forest and freedom - and memorized the flavors until he was drunk with her. The passion between them built as their kiss deepened. They explored each other in awe of the newness of being so close. After they broke apart breathlessly, they twined their hands together as they explored the cabin. Katniss refused to let Peeta's hand go even while they walked back to the opening of the fence, releasing it only when they were forced to go their separate ways. What had once signified the boundary between the civilized and the savage now became the portal to their own little freedom, where only the ageless forest bore witness to a crime as splendid and perfect as the woods that protected it.

""Will he be all right?"" ""He will be fine,"" Elrond said with a reassuring smile at his sons. ""Legolas, you must listen to me and do exactly as I tell you if you want your arm to heal properly so that you can learn to be a better archer than Glorfindel."" A short laugh told him that the Balrog-slayer had just entered the room. ""I am hardly the most skillful of archers, Elrond. You would do better by telling him he could learn to be a better archer than Beleg."" ""For one thing,"" Elrond said, looking at the Elf-lord reprovingly, ""I am hoping that Legolas will have a happier life than Beleg. For another, Cúthalion may have been the best archer of Thingol's realm, but Legolas did not know him. He knows you."" ""Anyway,"" Celebrían said, holding Legolas steady while her husband splinted the Elfling's arm, ""that is not the point. The point, tithen pen , is that if you want to be an archer and help protect your father's realm, then you will have to learn to listen to the healers. They are very important, for they are the ones who will help you when you have been injured in battle. If you do not do exactly as they tell you, you may find that it takes far longer for your injuries to heal completely. You cannot help your Ada very much then, can you?"" ""There,"" Elrond murmured, putting Legolas' arm in a sling. ""Finished. Legolas, listen to me. You must not take off the sling until your arm has healed. Your arm has healed when I tell you it has healed, not when you think it feels better."" ""Yes, Lord Elrond,"" Legolas said dolefully. Elrond laughed. ""Good. Then go to your room now. You must be tired. Elladan and Elrohir will get you something to eat, and after that you must sleep."" ""Before he goes to his room, Elrond,"" Glorfindel said firmly, ""I wish to have a word with Legolas."" The other Elves exchanged glances. Without a word, Elrond gathered his healing supplies and left the room, closely followed by Celebrían, Arwen and the twins. Erestor, however, merely leaned against the door frame, crossed his arms, and eyed Glorfindel with amusement. Imladris, 14 June Afternoon ""Legolas?"" The Elfling looked up at Glorfindel, his blue eyes beseeching. ""That will not work this time, Legolas,"" the Elf-lord said in a tone that made Erestor roll his eyes. ""You know you have been very naughty."" ""I did not know I would fall."" ""But we told you it was dangerous to go to the waterfall alone."" ""I was not alone. The owl was with me."" Legolas cast a sidelong glance at the window, his sudden smile attesting to the presence of the offending bird outside it, although what it was doing there instead of finding a place to sleep Glorfindel could not imagine. ""Legolas, did you honestly imagine an owl was fit escort?"" ""There were the trees,"" Legolas said defensively. ""Legolas."" The Elfling sighed. ""No, Lord Glorfindel."" ""Legolas, you are very young, and there are many things you do not know. When you are older, and have seen more of the world, you will be able to make your own decisions about what is dangerous and what is safe. For now, you must listen to us."" ""But –"" ""Legolas, Elrohir told you not to try to find the waterfalls by yourself, did he not?"" ""Yes, Lord Glorfindel."" ""Then, from the fact that you disregarded his advice, and mine, and went off in the middle of the night without telling anyone, are we to understand that you do not trust us?"" Legolas flushed. ""No, Lord Glorfindel."" ""Legolas, you must believe that we all care for you. If we tell you to do or not to do something we have a reason for it. You must have enough faith in us to do as we say."" ""What if I do not agree with what you say?"" Erestor hastily stifled a snicker. Glorfindel, after a moment's thought, said, ""If you do not agree, then you must tell us so. We will never refuse to explain why we tell you what we do."" He paused. ""Legolas, do you know how unhappy everyone would have been if something worse than a broken arm had happened to you?"" The Elfling squirmed uncomfortably. ""You know the twins and Arwen think of you as a brother. And what of your Ada and Nana ?"" "" Ada and Nana need not know,"" Legolas said hopefully. Glorfindel bit his lip just in time. ""Well, we will discuss that. But if your injury had been more serious, Lord Elrond would have had to inform them of it. They placed a great deal of trust in him by sending you here for the summer. Your Ada would be very angry with Lord Elrond if you were not returned to him in one piece."" "" Ada would be angry?"" This time Glorfindel did laugh. ""He is not as indulgent with everyone as he is with you, Elfling... Which is half the problem, really. But, yes, your Ada would be furious."" Legolas frowned in thought. ""So we understand each other, I take it. Inquisitiveness in an Elfling is good, but not disobedience."" ""Yes, Lord Glorfindel,"" Legolas replied, with such a woebegone expression that Glorfindel, finally relenting, scooped him up and ruffled his hair, ignoring Erestor's knowing smirk. ""Good. Come along, then... We can wait for Elladan and Elrohir in your room.""

It is impossible not to notice."" Gimli nodded, his throat tight. ""They treat him as though he were a student again; they do not let him win, but they do hold back. It is difficult for him, but it would be harder to be disarmed in the first ten seconds. That is why I have not objected, although, as I said, it is not for his sake that they do it."" ""Why?"" ""My brothers will sail soon,"" she said. ""I think they do not want to be here... at the end. Legolas has promised to stay as long as Estel is... with us. I do not think he entirely understands just how difficult it will be when the time comes. But I am glad he will be here. Elves hate partings, Gimli. When forever truly is forever, and when you know that the moment must come... Why do you think I have never returned to Imladris?"" Gimli stared at her, a thousand questions whirling through his mind. ""What do you do when that parting comes?"" Arwen shrugged, half-amused, half-rueful. ""We grieve. We sing. And we never forget."" Last scene of all, That ends this strange eventful history, Is second childishness and mere oblivion, Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything. Legolas stood in the doorway, afraid to enter, afraid not to enter. When Aragorn had sent for him, he had ridden at once and ridden hard, his instincts telling him that it was time. Now, as his eyes alighted on his friend, he knew he had been right. Aragorn was still not decrepit. He had the use of all his faculties and his movements were vigorous, if not as brisk as before. But there was something in his eyes, something that Legolas had not seen in any Elf. His friend looked weary in a way that frightened the young Elf. ""Estel?"" Aragorn looked up at him, and although he was the younger by several centuries, his eyes softened into an expression of paternal affection. It darkened into sorrow almost at once. ""I am sorry, Elfling."" He beckoned to Legolas to enter and shut the door. When the Elf had done so, he went on, ""I should have given more thought to what it would do to you to see this. Perhaps it would have been best for you to go when my brothers did."" "" No ,"" Legolas said sharply. Then, after a moment, ""That is irrelevant in any case. I am here."" ""You know why I called you?"" ""I can guess."" Legolas crossed the room swiftly, dropping to one knee beside Aragorn's chair. It was only when a smile flickered across his friend's face that he realized he had responded to Aragorn as he would to his own father. ""Is that how old I seem to you now?"" Aragorn asked, amusement lacing his tone. ""It is well past time to be gone."" "" Estel! "" ""I am sorry, Elfling. I should not have said that."" A trembling hand rested on Legolas' bowed head for a moment. Then it was gone, and Aragorn spoke again. ""Go to Eryn Lasgalen when this is done, Legolas."" Legolas looked up, startled. ""I thought you would tell me to leave."" ""I do think you should leave, but perhaps... after it is over... you will need the comfort of your father's presence more than what lies across the Sea. I do not know, but he will. Go to him. And do as he tells you."" Legolas rolled his eyes. ""And you wonder why I think you are like him!"" His voice did not shake too much, for which he was grateful. ""He is wise. He saw this day coming when I was sixteen."" Aragorn paused, looking at Legolas thoughtfully. ""He also told me I would regret giving you this grief far more than you would regret going through it. Are you sure he does not have the ability to foretell the future?"" ""I have never been entirely certain,"" Legolas admitted. Then, because he could push it aside and speak about other things, but he could not dismiss the thought entirely, ""Must it be now?"" ""Would you have me linger on until age weakens me even further, Elfling? Do you remember how it was for Faramir at the end?"" Legolas flinched involuntarily, and Aragorn sighed. ""I will come to that, in time, if I overstay my years. And once the decline begins, it will progress swiftly. In a few years you will barely know me. I will not be able to lift my sword; I may not even be able to stand unaided. I do not want your last memory of me to be of a decrepit old man drinking broth in his bed."" He hesitated, hand ghosting over Legolas' head again. ""Promise me you will go to your father, Elfling. I will have no peace if I do not know that you are safe."" Slowly, Legolas nodded, blinking tears out of his eyes. ""We will sing of you in the Blessed Realm,"" he offered. ""I know you will."" Aragorn slid a hand under Legolas' chin and tilted it up, forcing the Elf to meet his serious grey eyes. ""When you do, sing of me as I was, when we sparred in the gardens of Imladris, when I wooed Arwen in the eaves of the Golden Wood, when you and Gimli and I hunted Orc through the wilds."" ""We will remember all of you, Estel."" It was Aragorn's turn to nod. His hand dropped to Legolas' shoulder. He squeezed it once, convulsively, and then released it, clenching his fist around the arm of his chair. Legolas, understanding, stood to leave. When he reached the doorway, Aragorn said, ""Legolas."" The Elf turned. ""Thank you."" "" No celin a melthin idh raid lîn, Estel. "" What did you think? Good? Bad? Please review!"
342,2,5,2-Jedi-Sapphire-5.txt,lord-of-the-rings,JediSapphire,"be near Legolas, Lady Celebwen, until we have learnt the truth."" Looking from Eredhion and Voronwë, standing immovably in the path of anyone who might attempt to enter the room, to Saeldur, whose eyes were like flint, Thranduil knew that not even a direct order from him would make them yield, not when they saw a threat to Legolas. ""Legolas will not last another day if you do not let me help him,"" said Celebwen. Nobody said anything, but Thranduil could tell that all the young Elves were aware of that. Saeldur's fingers were so tight around the cup Thranduil feared it might break. ""Thranduil,"" Thorontur urged, ""say something."" Thranduil glanced around the room again. ""I find it very difficult to believe that Celebwen has anything but Legolas' best interests in mind."" He raised a hand to forestall Saeldur's objection. ""That said, I find it even more difficult to believe my son's friends would risk his wellbeing without a very good reason."" 6 September, Evening A lone Elf was in a store room by the Healing Wards. The door was open, but the shadows concealed him from any passersby in the corridor. He had seen Rochendilwen ride into the courtyard, even her battle-trained charger rolling its eyes and prancing nervously at the smell of blood. He had followed her discreetly. He had waited to see the flurry of activity in the Healing Wards as she handed Legolas into their care. He had waited to see Lord Thorontur, breathless with anxiety, burst into the room. He was waiting still. His patience was rewarded when the door opened. Rochendilwen and Lord Thorontur stepped into the corridor, followed by Lady Celebwen, Lord Thorontur's wife and one of the most experienced healers of the realm. The Elf prepared to strain his ears, but, unaware of any listeners, Lady Celebwen did not bother to lower her voice. ""It is too soon to say anything."" There was an undercurrent of tension, perhaps of fear. Good. Fear was good. ""There seems little doubt that the blade was poisoned. It is a bad wound in any case. Saeldur did well with the stitches, or Legolas would not have lasted the ride."" ""When will you know something?"" Thorontur asked, his normally steady voice shaking. ""I will tell you, meleth , as soon as I do. But you cannot do Legolas any good by hovering. Neither of you can. Go out, go to the archery ranges. I will send someone for you."" She went back in, shutting the door firmly. Rochendilwen and Thorontur stayed where they were, until sudden running footsteps made them start. The Elf leaned out a little to see the newcomer. Aeroniel; by the look of her, she had just returned from patrol and heard the rumours. ""How is he?"" she demanded. Then, taking in the sight of Rochendilwen's bloodstained tunic, ""Elbereth Gilthoniel. Is that all from Legolas? What do the healers say?"" ""That we must wait."" Thorontur shook his head. ""I do not like it, either, but my wife and daughters have the right of this. If only Barancrist had not gone with Thranduil…"" ""Lady Celebwen is a skilled healer, my lord,"" Aeroniel said quietly. ""Oh, she is. But Celebwen is too fond of Legolas to think entirely objectively. And Melda and Calathiel do not have as much experience as she does. Feredir is at least accustomed to treating Legolas…"" ""But he has gone with the King,"" Aeroniel finished. ""It is a difficult situation… We should speak to the archers. They have been hearing all sorts of rumours. Half of them fear Legolas is dead and we are keeping it secret."" She glanced at Rochendilwen. ""They cannot see you looking like that, or they will all believe Legolas is dead. Get a fresh tunic. Then we can go."" The Elf waited until all three of them had gone before slipping out of the store room. He hurried out of the stronghold to a small room behind the smithy, where his parents were waiting. ""It is time,"" he said, without giving them a chance to speak. "" Adar – naneth – it is time."" ""What happened, Arahael?"" His father pulled him inside and shut the door. ""Tell us everything."" ""Legolas was injured in the south. Saeldur sent him back – with Rochendilwen. I never thought Saeldur would show such good sense. It is the perfect arrangement."" ""Injured how?"" ""A wound from an Orc blade. The healers are still with him, so I do not know how serious it was. But Rochendilwen was covered in so much blood she looked as though she had slaughtered a horse."" ""If we are lucky,"" said Lord Míron, ""it will have been serious enough to kill him. But we cannot leave it to chance. Which healers are with him?"" ""Lord Thorontur's wife and daughters."" ""Even better. And Saeldur is still in the south. Do you know when he is expected to return?"" ""The archers are expected to break camp the day after tomorrow, at first light. They will not be trying to outrun Námo as Rochendilwen was, so they will take at least three days on the journey."" ""We must act quickly, then."" ""No,"" said Arahael's mother sharply. ""We must not be hasty. Thranduil and Arbellason are away, and, by happy chance, those of the healers who have the most experience in matters of poison are with them. Saeldur is in no danger of being suspected, since he is not even here. We will not have such an opportunity again, and we must not squander it by being rash."" ""What are we to do, then?"" The elleth smiled. ""There are messages to be sent to our friends. I will see to that. In the meantime, try to act normal. Nobody must suspect anything amiss. Now go. We will not speak of this again. What we do is necessary, but it is a dark thing to kill an Elf. Let it be done in silence."" What did you think? Good? Bad? Please review!"

""But then... You must be Prince Legolas!"" the Dúnadan exclaimed, horror tingeing his voice on the last word. Legolas nodded. ""Forgive me, ernil nîn . I did not mean to disturb you. I will go."" He went swiftly to the door, but, before opening it, he turned back to the Elf. ""Now that I have disturbed you, do you want anything?"" ""If you would draw the curtains... Forgive me; I do not know your name."" Legolas had not planned to ask the man for help, but the words came out of his mouth before he could stop them. He only had time for the barest sense of astonishment at himself; then the man said, ""Of course, my prince. My name is Suldal."" In the light that flooded into the room Legolas could see Suldal more clearly. He was not as fair as an Elf, nor as noble in his bearing, but there was just as much sympathy and concern in his eyes as there had been in Elrond's earlier. Legolas was no judge of men's ages, especially not when it came to Dúnedain, but this one had probably seen at least a century and a half. When the man had finished, he stepped away from the window, seeming to study Legolas as closely as Legolas was studying him. The silence was rapidly growing uncomfortable ""You sought someone else?"" Legolas asked in a desperate attempt to break it. ""Aye, Prince Legolas, one of my men. He was injured and we brought him here for healing... He is in the room beside this one. I'm so sorry, I should have been careful. I –"" ""Do not apologize,"" Legolas cut in. ""It has happened to me in the past."" A wide smile split the man's face. ""I could wish I had met you under more propitious circumstances, my prince. I believe we might have been friends."" Legolas repressed a shudder as the man came to the bedside again, this time seating himself in one of the chairs by the bed. He found himself wishing Elrond or one of the twins would come to check on him – the man seemed friendly, but the young Elf did not want to be left alone with him. It was too soon after his encounter with the brigands. The man seemed to sense what he was thinking. ""Lord Elrohir told us some of what happened... I am truly sorry that you should have received such inhuman treatment at the hands of my race, Prince Legolas. This may be difficult for you to believe at the moment, but most of us have respect and affection for the Eldar."" The man held out his hand. Legolas hesitated, not quite able to bring himself to take it. The man who had captured him had been just as friendly to begin with. Then he looked up into Suldal's face. There was no deception there: it was open, the man's eyes clear and bright. Still Legolas hesitated. He could not forget what had happened, not with his arm and shoulder still bound and his ribs aching... But if he let a few men taint his view of all the Secondborn, surely he was no better than the men who had tortured him only because he was an Elf. Making up his mind, the Elf-prince drew in a deep breath and grasped Suldal's forearm in a warriors' greeting. The door opened again, this time without a warning knock. Elladan came in, stopping short when he saw Suldal and fixing him with an accusing glare that made even Legolas draw back a little. The man laughed nervously. ""Forgive me, my lord. I came in looking for Baralin, and I could not resist staying to make Prince Legolas' acquaintance... It is not often that I meet a Sindarin prince, and even rarer that I meet an Elf who has seen fewer summers than I have."" He got to his feet, edging around Elladan to the door. ""It was a pleasure to meet you, Your Highness. I will go now. Mayhap we will meet again."" Elladan watched the door until it shut behind Suldal. Then he seated himself on the edge of the bed. ""Perhaps you are more of an adult than we give you credit for, Elfling."" Excerpt from Letter from Glorfindel to Círdan The Dúnadan insisted on spending time with Legolas on the archery ranges every day. (Not that I blamed him, mind you – the Elfling can shoot. It's a pleasure to watch him.) He had an unfortunate habit of telling Legolas stories from his youth. Well, you know the trouble men can get into... All I say is that I don't want to be Thranduil when Legolas returns to Eryn Galen with his head full of thoughts of mischief. For that matter, I don't want to be Suldal if Thranduil ever catches him. Legolas never saw Suldal after that summer, but over the centuries he met other men and learnt that they were capable of courage and nobility and greatness of heart. Some years – a short time, as the Eldar reckon these things – before the end of the Third Age of Middle-earth he was introduced to another man, the foster-son of Lord Elrond, with whom he shared something more than a light acquaintance. Between them was one of the greatest friendships ever known between Elf and Man, a friendship to rival that of Túrin Turambar and Beleg Cúthalion.

""You see? You admit it! You will be suffering the ill-effects for years."" ""When I am King of Gondor, I will have you thrown in the dungeons until you admit that you are an unreasonable child."" Eryn Galen, Several Centuries Ago It took Thranduil longer than he expected to find the plant the man had requested. When he finally returned, Legolas was just beginning to stir. ""You are here,"" the man said, looking up with a smile. ""Good. I did not expect him to wake so soon – apparently it does not have as strong an effect on Elves. I have stitched his wounds. I do not think there will be a problem, but you should take him to your own healers as soon as you can."" Thranduil nodded. ""I – I do not know how to thank you –"" ""Do not try, Master Elf,"" the man said, smiling. ""I am a father. I know how terrifying it can be to see a child hurt. I could not have lived with myself if I had not offered you aid."" Legolas stirred again, and he added, ""See to your son. He will want you when he wakes. I expect he will have no memory of this encounter later – he has been unconscious through most of it."" ""Can I pick him up?"" ""It should do no harm if you are careful."" Thranduil bent and scooped Legolas up gently. The Elfling's eyes flickered open. Thranduil hummed a snatch of a lullaby. Legolas' fist closed around a handful of his father's tunic as he snuggled up to his shoulder and dozed off. Thranduil supported his son with one arm, reaching out with the other to grasp the man's hand. ""Thank you. I do not know if I will ever meet you again – it is unlikely, because my wife will probably kill me when she sees him."" He paused, reached up to his throat, and disengaged a gold brooch, engraved with the symbol of Greenwood, that hung from the clasp of his cloak. ""I cannot hope to repay you for what you have done for my son, but perhaps you will keep this as a token of my gratitude."" The man took the brooch Thranduil held out, but his eyes stayed on the Elf's. ""Many things are said about your Elven-king,"" he said abruptly. ""There was a time when I did not know what to believe, but… The child would not trust you this much if you were as cold and unfeeling as the stories say."" Thranduil stared, and the man smiled. ""Take care of him, Your Majesty. Goodbye."" Somewhere Between Mirkwood and the Misty Mountains The healer rewrapped the bandages around Aragorn's wounds, looking from the drowsy man to the hooded figure hovering anxiously beside the bed. ""He is healing much faster than I expected. He should be fit to travel soon, but I would let him sleep the day out. The rest is clearly doing him good. I do not think you will need me again, but send someone for me if he gets worse. I doubt it will be necessary."" Legolas nodded. ""Thank you."" The man got to his feet and began putting his things back in his belt pouch. It slipped suddenly from his fingers, spilling its contents onto the floorboards. With an annoyed exclamation, he knelt to pick it up. ""Let me help you,"" Legolas offered, walking around to the other side of the bed. When he got there, a glint of gold among the small packages of herbs and the rolls of bandages caught his eye. He stopped short, staring, his fingers going unconsciously to the clasp of his cloak. Aragorn, leaning over to see what had caught his friend's attention, spotted the object as well. He came to full wakefulness at once, quickly seizing the jug from the bedside table to use as a weapon if the man should show any signs of threatening Legolas. ""You can put that down,"" the man said, finally getting his possessions together. ""I mean him no harm."" He got to his feet. ""If I were going to give you away, Master Elf, I would have done so last night."" Legolas lowered his hand, although Aragorn did not put the jug down. ""Where did you get that?"" ""It has been in my family for generations – for centuries, by some accounts. It is said that one of my forefathers met an Elf in the forest and helped him in his hour of need, and was given this as a mark of the Elf's gratitude. I do not know if the story is true, but I have been told by those who have travelled that the engraving is the sigil of the Elven-king of Mirkwood."" He looked at Legolas. ""Truly, Master Elf, I mean you no harm. Many in this village hate your race, but I am not one of them. I would advise you to take off your brooch, though."" Legolas nodded slowly. ""I did not imagine that anyone would recognize it."" He undid the brooch, paused, and placed it in the man's hands. The man looked at him in surprise. ""Perhaps you have use for another one… as a token of my gratitude for what you have done for my brother."" Several minutes later, after the healer had gone, Aragorn turned to Legolas. ""Whom did he meet?"" ""I do not know,"" Legolas said, shaking his head. ""One of the lords: no other would be wearing that. Thorontur or Arbellason, perhaps. I will have to ask Ada .""

345,2,6,2-Jedi-Sapphire-6.txt,lord-of-the-rings,JediSapphire,"is so drunk that he ends up hugging Elladan and bowing to Ellaurë. Legolas has noticed this, and I have a feeling that poor Eredhion will be hearing about it for a very long time. I suddenly remember how many centuries it has been since I reminded Thorontur of the night after his betrothal to Celebwen. Perhaps I will find time for that later. We usually try not to embarrass each other before our children, but if I can get him sufficiently inebriated, he is unlikely to recall enough to extract vengeance later. Thorontur is watching me with narrowed eyes. Maybe this time discretion is the better part of valour. He has extinguished the lamps and come to the firing line, and he grips Legolas' forearm in a warriors' greeting before bending to whisper something in his ear. Legolas looks appalled and shakes his head vehemently. I will have to find out what Thorontur has said. It has always been a sensible policy to keep a mental record of things with which I can threaten my son. There is suddenly a lot of noise. Most of the Elves have had rather a lot of wine, and it is a miracle that they managed to stay quiet this long. I am not displeased, because it is a happy noise that bodes well for my son, but the ceremony has to be completed. I nod to Arbellason, who yells, "" Sedho! "" There is immediate silence. Arbellason tends to have that effect on the warriors – on all Elves, for that matter. Elladan has Legolas' silver circlet. Legolas made a fuss about wearing that, but when I pointed out to him that the alternative was to let the ellith twine a crown of flowers in his hair, he decided that a circlet was not such a bad thing. I have learnt some tricks from my father. Legolas looks nervous again as the circlet is put on his head. It is not only the command of the Colhador that he takes on this particular begetting day. He will now begin carrying out his full duties as my heir. This means, among other things, that he will be Regent if I am absent. He has begged me not to go anywhere. I remember how nervous I was when I stood before my father like this. At that moment if someone had told me I could live out my days as a warrior and never have to lead anyone or give orders in my father's absence, I would have accepted the offer gratefully. I understand now why my father looked so proud on that day. Legolas comes forward, his steps faltering. The crowd parts to make way for him. When he reaches me, he drops to one knee, takes my hand, and, as he did when he first swore his oaths as a warrior, kisses the signet ring I wear. I want to snatch him up in my arms, but I wait patiently for him to stand. It seems to take an eternity. When at last he is on his feet, his eyes not quite meeting mine, I ask him if he is willing to command the Colhador. I have practised in secret, but now that the moment has come, I cannot keep the pride from my voice. ""Yes, my King,"" Legolas mumbles, so softly that I am sure half the Elves have not heard him. They cheer all the same. I do not ask him if he is willing to take up the duties of my heir. Refusing is not an option there. Our people are fond of him, and they want him to play the part of a prince when he can be spared from his responsibilities as a warrior. Considering the fear they have to live with everyday, they deserve to have this. I take Legolas by the shoulders and turn him round to face the crowd. It is not only the warriors, now. Most of the Elves who were at the feast have turned up. The healers are standing in a small knot to one side, all frowning at Legolas suspiciously, as though they would not put it past him to break a rib or dislocate his shoulder while just standing there. I must admit that they have cause to be wary. "" Mellyn nîn ,"" I say, and now I do not even try to keep the emotion from my voice, ""I give you my son, Legolas Thranduilion, prince of the woodland realm and commander of my archers."" Then I draw Thorontur forward, and add, ""And I also give you our newest Archery Master."" There is more cheering, and Thorontur is dragged away, presumably in the direction of more food and some wine. Several of Legolas' friends come up to us, and they distribute their congratulations evenly between us – mainly, I suspect, because they are too drunk to tell between us in the darkness. The young Elves also drift away in the direction of the feast. The sons of Elrond glance at me questioningly, and I know it is time for Legolas to go and have some real dinner, and possibly some more wine. But I want to speak to him first. I indicate that they should go on ahead, and they nod their understanding. When at last we are left alone, I turn to Legolas. And now words fail me. How can I tell him how proud I am of his skill, how much it means to me that he risks his life to defend our home and our people? How can I tell him how much I love him? Instead of saying anything, I pull him closer and kiss his brow. He reaches up to hug me, and I know there is no need for words. Like Lindariel, Legolas understands.

They eluded us and we gave chase, but at last, they gained the southern reaches of the forest, where the Shadow is darkest. The trees cannot aid us there as they do in the north; the Enemy stifles their power. We had then no hope of saving him. The southern reaches are crawling with orcs and giant spiders all the way to Dol Guldur, where your son was being taken."" There was a sudden noise, and Legolas looked up to see Hiron standing in the doorway. He had evidently heard most of the conversation. The Elf bowed his head and went on. ""If Elves are taken, and there is no hope of rescue, we usually end their lives before they are out of reach of our arrows. The close kin of our warriors all know this, and consent to it. A swift death is better than slow torture in the dungeons of the Enemy, and from Dol Guldur there is no escape. We did not know who your son was, and we had no way of finding out before it was too late... So I took the decision myself."" He met the eyes of the woman opposite him. ""Forgive me, my lady. I know this must cause you grief, and I have no solace to offer, save only that he did not suffer."" Her eyes were bright with tears. ""Do not ask my forgiveness, Master Elf. It was not your fault that my son ran away, nor that he was taken by orcs."" ""My wife speaks truly,"" Hiron said, coming into the room. ""I... I do not deny that this breaks my heart, but it would have been far worse to know that my son had died in torment in the shadowed lands to the south."" ""What happened to his body?"" his wife whispered. ""We buried him in the forest, as we do to all warriors who die far from home, and planted a beech at his head. It must be a strong sapling by now. I know this is not your custom, but –"" ""Peace, Master Elf,"" the woman replied softly. ""He was buried with honour, and I am content."" Legolas managed a smile. ""Thank you, my lady. Even among Elves not all would not be so understanding."" He hesitated, and then added, ""Should you wish to visit your son's final resting place... My king does not normally permit outsiders into our forest, and I would not recommend making the journey now. But, in a more peaceful year, if you go to the borders of the woodland realm and tell the guards that you are friends of Legolas, you will be allowed to enter."" She glanced at her husband and then back at him. ""Thank you... Legolas. Do not be troubled about this. We do not blame you, and you have our gratitude."" Imladris, After the Council of Elrond ""So this is the quest,"" Legolas said. He and Aragorn were sitting together under the trees, Legolas looking up at the stars and Aragorn staring moodily at the ground. ""Aye,"" the human said laconically. ""And you are going with the Halfling."" ""Aye."" Legolas nodded. ""That settles it, then. I am coming with you."" Aragorn stared at him. "" Ada will never let you put yourself in danger like that! And Elladan has very specific instructions from your father to prevent you from doing anything reckless and dangerous – like volunteering to cross the Misty Mountains –"" ""Because of course I did not cross the Hithaeglir on my way here –"" ""And go to Mordor?"" Legolas chuckled. ""Leave that to me, tithen pen . I have not known your father for two and a half thousand years without knowing how to get around him."" ""I do not want you to come just for my sake!"" Slowly, Legolas shook his head. ""I would willingly come only for your sake, gwador n în , but I have other cause as well. There is a young adan child who deserves to grow up in a safer world than her brother did, and a woman who must visit the final resting place of her son."" ""What happened, Elfling?"" Aragorn asked. ""Is this something to do with who patched you up after you escaped the orcs?"" Legolas nodded. His friend slipped an arm around his shoulders and said, ""Tell me, tithen gwador ."" For several minutes the only sounds were the wind shaking the branches overhead and the soft murmur of an Elven voice. At the end of it, Aragorn glanced at Legolas. ""And are you troubled, Elfling?"" ""No... I have had to do it before. There was no choice. And... his naneth reacted much better than some. I was terrified that she would not understand that it had been for the best, for her son."" Aragorn smiled, pulling the Elf into a quick hug. ""So you are coming on the quest?"" ""Only if I can persuade Lord Elrond."" Aragorn snorted. ""We both know that you will be able to do that without difficulty. I will be glad to have your company , gwador nîn . "" Then he glanced in the direction of the house. ""And now we should go inside, before they send out a search party."" Legolas nodded and got to his feet, pulling the Man up with him. "" Tolo. "" ""Legolas?"" ""Yes?"" "" Le hannon.

Perhaps if somebody had stopped us that first time, it would have been different."" Then he managed a smile. ""But if we had not been out hunting Orc, we would not have been there to persuade your mother to bring you to Imladris. So it has not all been bad."" He gave Estel's hand a light squeeze. ""Has Legolas ever joined –?"" Estel began, and then stopped abruptly when Elrohir and Legolas came to join them. ""Joined their hunting?"" Legolas enquired, and Estel realized with a start that the two Elves had probably heard everything. ""I have never joined them actively, but I have helped , as I did today."" ""Everyone must surely praise my foresight now,"" Elrohir said, trying to lighten the mood. ""I always said it was a good idea to teach the Elfling how to shoot."" Estel tried to smile. Hours later, Estel, buried under a pile of blankets, was drifting in and out of a restless doze while on either side of him Elladan and Elrohir slept as even Elves had to when they had been through several days of very rough and nearly-ceaseless battle. Legolas, who had volunteered to take the night's watch, was high in the branches of a tree. Jerked to abrupt awareness by the sound of laughter above him, Estel opened his eyes. For a moment he looked around, puzzled; then more laughter floated down from above. He scrambled to his feet, careful not to disturb the sleeping Elves, and peered up at the interlocking branches overhead. Moonlight glinting on the tip of an arrow showed him the Elf's location. As silently as he could, Estel scooped up a handful of snow, balled it, and flung it into the tree at Legolas. Whether it was Legolas or the oak tree that realized the snowball was coming Estel never found out. At any rate, there was a sudden creaking noise as an oak branch lowered itself, an audible snicker, and the young man found himself being seized by the scruff of his tunic. Estel did not bother to protest when, after being hauled unceremoniously through the branches, he found himself settled comfortably on a thick one with his back resting against the tree trunk. Legolas was on one slightly below; but he was standing on it, so that his eyes were level with the young man's. ""Why are you not asleep?"" ""I cannot sleep,"" Estel confessed, as the snow, which had held off for most of that day, began to fall again. ""I keep thinking about... about... how I ran into the battle. I thought it would help me, but I hated it later. I hated the idea of what I had done, but I do not know why. I do not think I will ever be a good warrior, Legolas. I could barely think during the battle; when it was over I did not even remember most of what had happened."" ""Estel, that happens to everyone. It is one of Eru's mercies. There are very few battles I can remember clearly, and I am grateful for that. If you dislike the idea of having killed Orcs so much, think of what it would be like to live with the memory of blood and death."" ""You do not understand,"" Estel mumbled. ""What do I not understand?"" ""I did not fight because it was the right thing to do, or because the Orcs were evil, or even because I wanted to help Elladan and Elrohir. I fought because – because of my father, and Lady Celebrían. Lord Glorfindel always says you should not fight in anger."" Estel's voice began to shake. Legolas vaulted himself up onto his friend's branch at once, putting his hands on the slender shoulders. ""I am frightened of myself,"" Estel went on unhappily. ""I am frightened of what I could become."" ""Good."" Since this was the last answer he had expected, Estel stared at Legolas in shock. The Elf laughed. ""As long as you are frightened,"" he explained, ""you will not become the thing that you fear. It is only when you stop being frightened that I will begin to worry."" ""What about Elladan and Elrohir?"" ""What about them?"" ""You heard what Elladan said. They will not stop."" ""I did not expect them to."" Legolas undid his cloak and handed it to Estel, who had begun to shiver despite the thick coat he wore. ""It would mean nothing if they stopped because I or anybody else wanted them to. They must stop because they want to. That is the only way they will find peace... For now, it is enough that we will spend Yule together in Imladris. That was the best I expected."" ""Is there nothing I can do to help?"" ""I think you help them more than you know,"" Legolas said quietly. ""You help us all more than you could possibly imagine, Estel."" Smiling at the young man, he added, ""And now you should go to sleep."" ""I will need help getting down,"" Estel said, leaning to his right to peer at the drop to the ground. ""I cannot jump that distance."" ""Down? Who said anything about getting down? It is snowing and you will be buried by morning."" Before Estel could demand an explanation, he found the branches closing around him, sheltering him from the cold. ""Do not worry,"" Legolas said. ""The tree will not let you fall. I should go wake your brothers, although it really would serve them right to be buried in a snowdrift. Sleep well."" Then the Elf was gone, and Estel was alone with the stars. But the tree was surprisingly comfortable, and the babble of familiar voices and laughter was soothing. It was not long before the young man was fast asleep, cradled safely by the branches of the ancient tree. What did you think? Good? Bad? Please review!"

Aragorn has eyes for neither weapons master nor Elven-king; he had thrown his arms around Eldarion and practically lifted him off the ground. "" Ada! "" the youth protested. ""I can't breathe!"" Aragorn released Eldarion, only to take him by the shoulders and look him over. ""You don't seem to be hurt,"" he said at last, reluctantly. ""What happened?"" ""We had a small accident, my Lord,"" the weapons master said. Aragorn nodded without looking up. ""One of the boys broke his arm falling from a tree. It has been set, and he has come to no permanent harm, but it delayed our return."" ""We worried,"" Aragorn murmured, still looking closely at Eldarion. ""Is something wrong with your hand, penneth ? Are you sure? When you did not return by nightfall, we feared the worst. The countryside is still not as safe as it ought to be."" ""I was worried as well, my Lord,"" the weapons master said. ""But we were fortunate enough to meet Prince Legolas and his party on their way to Minas Tirith, and their company made our journey swifter and safer."" "" Legolas? "" Aragorn asked, finally looking up. ""What was he – Legolas!"" The Elf, who had entered just behind the weapons master and who had not said a word so far, grinned at the King. "" Mae govannen, Estel ."" Aragorn stared at the Elf, wondering whether to welcome him, thank him or ask what he had been doing near Minas Tirith. He finally settled on saying, ""You're here."" ""I had noticed,"" Legolas commented with a wry smile. Before Aragorn could say anything further, Eldarion demanded, "" Ada , can I go now? I'm tired."" ""Of course,"" Aragorn said, patting his son's back. ""You must be. Go to bed, and we will discuss this in the morning. Are you hurt?"" ""No, Ada ."" ""Go on, then."" Eldarion gave his father a brief hug, inclined his head to Thranduil and the weapons master, and, on his way out of the room, paused beside Legolas to stand on tiptoe and whisper in his ear something involving the words archery and tomorrow . Legolas chuckled. "" Ae an í rach, tithen pen. But only if you are well rested."" Eldarion flashed the Elf a brilliant smile and scampered out of the room, followed by the weapons master. Aragorn finally turned his attention to his closest friend. ""What are you doing here?"" ""That's a nice welcome!"" Legolas said. ""If you don't want me to stay, I'll just leave, then."" Aragorn shook his head. ""You know I want you to stay. But I did not expect you now."" ""If you must know,"" Legolas said, unstrapping his quiver and dropping into a chair, ""It was meant to be a surprise for your begetting day – which is next week, in case you had forgotten. Arwen and I have been planning it for some weeks."" ""So that's why Arwen wasn't really worried about Eldarion! She knew you would be on your way to Minas Tirith and bound to meet them."" Legolas only smiled. Aragorn crossed the room and sat down next to his friend. "" Le hannon. If you had not found them –"" ""But we did,"" Legolas said calmly. ""And so do not worry any more. I promised Eldarion I would see that you did not fuss unduly. You're getting as bad as my father."" Aragorn glanced at the Elven-king, whose face had broken into a wicked smile at Legolas' comment. ""My King, we cannot let that pass."" ""Of course not,"" Thranduil agreed. ""Legolas, on your guard."" ""What!"" Legolas yelped as Aragorn yanked him to his feet. ""No! I am a battle-weary warrior. I must rest!"" Greenwood, Around Year 2500 of the Third Age Thranduil paused only to tell Galion to have dinner sent up to Legolas' room. Then he went straight to the royal quarters and knocked on his son's door. There was no answer, so he knocked again, and finally pushed the door open and went in. The room was empty, but the balcony door was open. Thranduil went outside. Legolas was standing on the balcony, hands resting lightly on the parapet, looking out into the darkness. "" Penneth? "" Thranduil asked softly. Legolas turned. "" Ada. "" ""Are you hurt?"" In response, Legolas stepped away from the parapet and spread his arms. Thranduil smiled. ""Come inside, Legolas. I've told Galion to send dinner up for us. You may not be injured, but you must be tired."" ""I'm fine,"" Legolas said automatically, but he followed his father back into the room without further protest. Once inside, Legolas dropped into a chair. Thranduil glanced at him in some concern but said nothing, instead kneeling before the hearth to tip some kindling into the grate. He lit the fire and got to his feet. ""What happened, Legolas?"" ""There were more orcs than we anticipated – and then the river flooded, because of melts in the mountains, I suppose. And when we –"" ""Legolas."" Thranduil sat down next to his son. ""That was not what I meant. Is everyone all right?"" ""Yes,"" Legolas responded softly. Thranduil held out his arms and the younger Elf snuggled into them with a sigh of contentment. ""I missed you, Ada ."" ""I know, tithen las ,"" Thranduil murmured, running one hand gently over his son's bowed head. ""I missed you too.

Your brother must be a wise man indeed."" ""My father… May I speak to you in confidence?"" ""Of course… So long as what you tell me does not imperil our Quest."" ""The reason I spoke in Council for the Ring to be given to Gondor was that my father asked it of me. He suspected that it had been discovered. I do not…"" Boromir paused to drink some more wine. Legolas rather thought he had had too much. ""I do not know what he will say when he hears of my decision to pledge myself to see it destroyed instead. I do not imagine he will be pleased. But Faramir… I think Faramir would approve."" ""Lord Boromir, nothing you, or for that matter your brother, could have said or done would have persuaded Mithrandir or Lord Elrond to give the weapon of the Enemy to Gondor. It is too dangerous and too powerful. It must be destroyed. You know this."" ""I do believe it now. But my father does not. I fear that in following my conscience, I have disappointed him."" Boromir sighed. ""Tell me, what would you have done in my place?"" ""I cannot say,"" Legolas admitted. ""I would find it very difficult to disobey a direct order from the Elven-king. But although my King might be displeased, my father would not blame me for doing what I believed was right. I know little of your lord father, but he comes of a noble line. I doubt he will be angry with you."" ""You know little indeed of my lord father if you think that."" Boromir took a long draught. ""When we were children, Faramir and I, all he told us, all he ever told us, was that Gondor came first. Gondor had to be protected at all costs. Mordor is an eternal threat, and against this threat we were to guard our people. The Ring would have helped us defend Gondor. And now… not only have I failed to obtain the Ring, I have committed myself to a course of action which, should we be discovered by the Enemy, will bring his wrath down upon us. And Gondor will suffer first."" ""It was a difficult decision,"" Legolas said. ""And I honour you for choosing as you did. That you are here, now, prepared to embark on a quest to destroy the weapon you came here to claim shows that you were meant to be a part of this. Your father will understand your choice in time."" ""My father does not change his mind easily."" ""Then you must judge your actions by your own lights. You said your father told you to defend Gondor. The path you have chosen is the only one that will ensure the safety of the world of Men, including Gondor. You have done your father's bidding, even if he does not see it."" Boromir let out a long breath. ""I can be content with that."" Lothlórien, TA 3019 January ""The Stone of Eärendil."" ""It is time,"" said Galadriel, holding up the green gem. It sparkled with the light of the sun. ""The Elfstone belongs to Middle-earth. Here it will stay."" ""It is a fine gift."" ""I have nothing else to give Aragorn. No sword can take the place of the one he carries already. He has already won the heart of the Evenstar. This is a token of her choice, no more. Yet it may give him courage to face what must come. I will give him a scabbard as well. Andúril must have a worthy sheathe if its bearer is to rise above his past."" ""What of Boromir? Will you give him a sword?"" ""No."" Galadriel put the Elfstone down. ""Boromir's path is wreathed in shadow. Stout as his heart is, the power of Sauron may yet prove to be too much for him. I would not put an Elven blade in his hand. I will give him a belt, after the fashion of Lothórien, to remind him of the Lady of the Golden Wood."" ""If the Lady of the Golden Wood cannot save him from a terrible fate, nobody can,"" said Celeborn gravely. ""What of the others?"" ""I will give Frodo's two young kinsmen belts as well, but that is not out of any fears for their loyalty. They already carry Daggers of Westernesse. They will have need of no stronger weapons than those the Dúnedain wrought to fell the Witch-king of Angmar… I do not yet know what to give Gimli."" ""A belt?"" asked Celeborn, but Galadriel shook her head. ""He has neither sword nor dagger to put in it. Lothlórien does not make axes. No, I will let Master Gimli choose his own gift. He will not disappoint me."" ""Do you fear to give Legolas a sword?"" ""I would give him one, and gladly, if I thought it might be of use to him. But the sword is not Legolas' weapon."" She smiled. ""What do you think I should give the finest archer in Middle-earth?"" Celeborn met her eyes with a smile of his own. ""You mean to give him a longbow of the galadhrim ."" ""Do you disagree?"" ""Not in the least. I knew the child would win you over. In the beginning you worried that he had inherited Thranduil's temperament, and now, alone of the all the Fellowship, you are willing to put a weapon in his hands."" ""We have all grown in wisdom since last we met. I would never have thought Thranduil could raise a child with a spirit so bright in his darkening realm. Perhaps Thranduil, too, would think better of me now, as I am certain I would think better of him."" Celeborn laughed. ""Explain it as you wish, my love. The truth is that the child has won you over."" ""Yes,"" agreed Galadriel. ""He has."" What did you think? Good? Bad? Please review!"

""If you desire,"" Thandraug said, resigned, ""I can take you to Lord Aragorn. He always takes an interest in the training of the children. I am certain he would like to meet you. He might even have some suggestions for you."" ""I would not like to disturb Lord Aragorn,"" Suiadan murmured. ""I am certain he has much to do. Perhaps I will explore the forest."" Thandraug did not bother to offer the young man a guide. He had a strong feeling that such an offer would be rejected at once, and some plausible but highly irregular reason given. Not for the first time that day, he wished he knew why Lord Halbarad had spoken so highly of Suiadan. Lord Halbarad was not known to favour lunatics. By this time they had reached the residential area of the settlement. Thandraug could see two figures standing outside his house, although they were still too far away for him to make out their faces. One, he supposed, must be his wife; he had no idea who the other might be. He pointed the house out to Suiadan. For some reason, the sight of it seemed to make the other man nervous. ""It might be too much of an imposition on your lady,"" he said, sidling behind Thandraug. ""I would not want to put her to any undue trouble. I am not very hungry in any case. Perhaps I should just retire to my quarters and... and... rest."" Since this was the first time the young Ranger was showing an inclination for repose, Thandraug was more than a little surprised. He was also slightly suspicious. In these dark days one could never be certain who might be a thief or a murderer or something even more unsavoury. It seemed absurd to associate treachery and dark deeds with the buoyant, incorrigibly enthusiastic young man beside him, but the fact remained that Suiadan was behaving strangely. ""My wife would be deeply disappointed if you did not come,"" he said gravely. ""She considers it an honour to welcome guests to our home."" Suiadan responded without a moment's hesitation, making Thandraug feel ashamed of his suspicions. ""I should not dream of depriving your lady of any honour that is her due. I must once again ask your pardon if I gave offence, and assure you that none was meant."" He looked so woebegone at the thought that Thandraug hastened to say, ""I am not offended at all, my friend. Shall we go? Vanyë will not soon forgive me if I keep you standing here instead of asking you inside."" He led the way towards his house. When they drew close enough for him to be able to identify the person standing with his wife, he gave a startled exclamation. ""That is Lord Halbarad! I do not know what he could want. I hope nothing has happened to my sons."" He quickened his step as much as his limp would allow. Halbarad saw them coming and stepped forward to greet them. ""No, no, do not worry,"" he said at once, seeing Thandraug's anxious face. ""Your children have suffered no injury. Forgive me. I did not wish to alarm you. I only wanted to speak to Suiadan, and I expected that you would bring him – you !"" Thandraug jumped. The last word had been uttered with a strange mixture of shock and bewilderment. Halbarad was openly staring at Suiadan, although he only looked surprised, not unwelcoming. ""You... Suiadan?"" ""Yes, my lord,"" Suiadan said. He sounded even more nervous than he had done earlier. ""I... I was told to give the children basic weapons training, my lord."" ""Oh."" There was a pause. ""You have changed a great deal since I saw you last."" Suiadan flushed, but he did not reply. ""Well... I am pleased to see you again, Master Suiadan. The children are fortunate to be able to learn from you. I will not take up too much of your time. I only wished to enquire whether you found the arrangements for your stay satisfactory."" ""They are more than adequate, my lord. I slept in the greatest comfort last night."" Thandraug thought he sounded far more grateful than a comfortable bedroom warranted. For some reason, Halbarad's eyes flickered to a group of ash and beech trees behind the warriors' quarters before he replied, ""I do not doubt it. Do not hesitate to let me know if there is something you need. Lord Aragorn, as you are no doubt aware, would be most seriously displeased if he found that you had wanted for anything during your stay."" ""I will, my lord, I thank you."" ""Then I will bid you farewell for the moment, Suiadan, Thandraug."" Halbarad turned to the woman waiting in the doorway. ""It was a pleasure to speak to you, Lady Vanyë."" He walked a few steps in the direction of his own home, turned, and added, ""I believe Lord Aragorn will be busy for the next few days. You may not be able to see him until the end of next week."" ""Of course, my lord,"" Suiadan said. ""I understand."" ""I am going to see him now – I have a message to give him. He was expecting a visit from an old friend, but the friend appears to have been delayed on the road. Did you chance to see anything on your way here that might explain the delay?"" ""The road appeared clear, my lord. Perhaps there were urgent affairs in his home?"" ""Perhaps,"" Halbarad agreed. ""I do hope he will arrive soon... I will leave you to your lunch now. Suiadan, once again, let me know at once if you are in any difficulty for any reason."" Suiadan inclined his head formally. *offers Tuilinn apples and promises him more screen time in the next two chapters* What did you think? Good? Bad? Please review!"

That is not what disturbs me. As I said, it is difficult to explain. I sense a power here, Master Gimli, that is more than simply the grace of the Eldar – more even than the grace bestowed upon Lady Galadriel by the sight of the Two Trees."" ""The Ring?"" ""No. The Ring is evil. Its strength is in violence and malice. I explained myself badly. I do not sense evil. But I do sense power. Benevolent power, I believe, but still a power that is not of this forest."" ""If it has kept the forest safe…"" ""It has, but at a cost."" Legolas patted the tree, which responded with a vague feeling of goodwill. ""The soul can be stifled by over-caring as much as by malice."" ""The soul of the forest has been stifled?"" ""Can you not sense it?"" Legolas shrugged. ""I suppose not. These trees have never known sorrow, and they have never known true joy either. The Lady Galadriel is blessed by the Valar, and her grace has held the Shadow at bay. But she was born in lands far to the West, and she longs for them. This is a beautiful land, but it is not a forest of Middle-earth. It is an echo of the Elvenhome."" ""Is your Mirkwood a forest of Middle-earth?"" ""Greenwood,"" Legolas said firmly. "" Greenwood , and yes. That there is darkness there I do not deny, but that darkness is as much a part of Middle-earth as the great oaks or the water of the Forest River. The Ring was forged in Middle-earth."" ""It was, but we are not bound to lie still and wait for the Enemy to declare his victory!"" ""Nor do we. We fight, Master Gimli. With bow and blade, with breath and blood, we fight the Shadow. But our weapons are our own. The trees of Mirkwood give us our bows and arrow shafts, and metal mined by your kinsmen and fired in our forges is in our blades."" ""The Enemy is strong."" ""And even now our greatest hope is in the heart and courage of a Halfling."" ""I would not have wanted that."" Legolas met his father's eyes. ""Had I been born a hundred years from now, or a thousand, or however many it must be before the Enemy is defeated, I could not have eased your burden."" The Elven-king smiled, though it did not quite reach his eyes. ""You cannot know how much you do precisely that."" He stood, bringing Legolas to his feet as well. ""Yet the fact remains that we have made many sacrifices, not the least of which is the peace of our warriors."" ""We are holding our ground."" ""And what do you think?"" At Legolas' questioning glance, Thranduil went on, ""You said I acted in the interests of the realm in deciding not to ask Galadriel or Elrond for help. You did not say I had made the right decision."" Legolas responded with a wry smile. ""I did not intend to question your judgement, I assure you, my king."" ""In the privacy of my sitting room I have always encouraged you to question my judgement. Do you disagree with me, then?"" ""I would not say I disagree,"" Legolas said slowly. ""I do not entirely understand. While you command it, and while even a single one of your people still dwells beneath the trees, I will fight to defend the realm. And if you believe the realm is better defended by the bow than by… whatever Lady Galadriel uses… You have never given me reason to doubt you."" Thranduil sighed. ""I would be lying if I said I have never considered it. I might even have done it, regardless of the consequences, if my warriors had not proven themselves willing and able to defend the realm."" He laid a hand on Legolas back. ""As I said, you cannot know how much you ease my burden."" ""Would the consequences be that terrible?"" ""If ever you visit Lothlórien,"" Thranduil said, ""you will understand."" ""Lothlórien? I have heard it described as beautiful beyond compare."" ""Yes. It is."" ""Frodo is brave,"" Gimli agreed. ""And I believe I would trust his heart, and those of his young companions, as much as I would trust the grace of the Lady of the Golden Wood."" Legolas laughed, genuine amusement in the sound. ""From you, that is a high compliment, Master Gimli. Frodo would be honoured if he heard."" Gimli grunted. ""Do you regret that we came here?"" ""Regret? Not at all. We needed peace. We needed time to regain our strength and our courage. Lothlórien and Lady Galadriel gave us both. This is a perfect haven."" ""And no more than a haven."" ""No more, and no less. I was not lying when I said I have long wanted to visit Lothlórien. The Golden Wood is legend among my kin. I have not been disappointed. The mallorn and elanor are beautiful beyond my imaginings. Yet I worry for my father and my friends, and if Frodo's quest were not vital to the survival of Middle-earth, I would be riding north this moment to defend my home."" ""And what when the times comes for you to leave Middle-earth and your home?"" Gimli demanded. ""I heard the Elves in Rivendell speak of it. There are many who will sail West as soon as the Ring has been destroyed."" ""Many have felt the call,"" Legolas said, ""but I have felt not a flicker of it yet. My heart is in the forest, Master Gimli, with the oak and the beech. I am content. It will be a very long time, by your reckoning, before my time in Middle-earth ends."" Gimli made no response beyond a shrug. Legolas, leaning back again, looked up at the night sky. Eärendil shone down like a beacon of hope. What did you think? Good? Bad? Please review!"

He was using them as though they were a pair of broadswords, and Elladan was certain that in a matter of minutes he would either shatter one of the blades or be mortally wounded. ""Dan!"" Aragorn's voice snapped behind him. ""Stop gaping and fight!"" Thranduil knew he could not keep it up long. Every second he was being reminded more clearly exactly why he disliked knives. He liked to able to let forth his anger with furious, sweeping strokes that clove through the toughest armour... And here he was being forced to thrust pointlessly at weaknesses like an Elfling sparring with a master swordsman. ""Never again,"" he muttered, raising the knives to defend himself against a pair of orcs. This time he was unlucky; the knives were too small to give him adequate defence, and one orc knocked them aside while the other thrust easily past Thranduil's guard before the Elf could react. He felt a burning pain in his shoulder, gasped, and fell to the ground. He pushed himself hastily into a sitting position and reached for the knives he had dropped. The orcs came towards him with a menacing growl – But before they could take more than a step there was a flash of grey and Legolas was before them, Thranduil's sword held very firmly in his hands. Thranduil noted with more than a little concern that his son's right arm still seemed to be troubling him a little, which would make it even harder for him to fight with the unfamiliar weapon. Legolas held out longer than his father expected, but in a very short time the sword was knocked from his hand and he took an uncertain step back as the orcs advanced on him. ""Here!"" Thranduil called. ""Take these!"" At the sound of his father's voice Legolas turned, and held out his hands to catch the knives the Elven-king tossed to him. Elrohir was sure the entire line of Oropher had gone mad. First Legolas, and now Thranduil, who was one of the finest swordsmen Elrohir knew, had been disarmed by a pair of orcs . The orcs were almost all dead now; the few that remained were clustered around the Elven archers. Elrohir reached for his bow, hoping to get a couple of arrows off if it looked like the Elven-king was in need of help. He felt Elladan and Aragorn doing the same thing beside him. ""This is ridiculous,"" Aragorn muttered. Elladan laughed. ""Look at it this way; if one of us has to shoot to save Legolas, he will never live it down."" Elrohir could not help grinning at that. He saw the orcs advancing on Thranduil, and raised his bow, taking careful aim... But they were too close together, and while he might have trusted his hand if he had been on one of the archery fields, this was too great a risk... Then Legolas shouted something, and Thranduil turned and snatched out of the air the twin knives that were thrown in his direction. He whipped around to face the orcs again, a grim smile on his face, although Elrohir had no idea how he hoped to defend himself with knives when his sword had proved useless. One of the orc blades came down – And was met by a knife that knocked it aside and did not pause to defend, but thrust forward into the gap in the armour under the orc's arm. ""That can't be Thranduil,"" Elladan said in disbelief. ""He hates knives."" ""It isn't,"" Aragorn said, his eyes suddenly sparkling with amusement. ""It's Legolas ."" ""My King?"" Elrohir said softly, as he, Elladan and Thranduil watched Aragorn blindfold Legolas carefully. ""Yes?"" ""Why did you do it?"" ""I will tell you if you promise never to tell Elrond –"" ""We won't,"" Elladan put in. ""Or Galadriel or Celeborn –"" ""We won't,"" Elrohir said. ""Very well, then."" Thranduil drew in a deep breath, squared his shoulders, and turned to face the two younger Elves. ""I had negotiated the price of wine and cloth and spice for eight days and I was bored."" "" Bored? "" Elladan asked, his voice quivering. ""You mean – you did all this because –"" ""Don't,"" Thranduil implored. ""I have had one lecture from Legolas already. I cannot take another one, definitely not from the two of you."" Elrohir pretended to look hurt. ""So the Elfling who has seen the inside of a healing ward more often than any other Elf in all Arda –"" ""Only because I had to keep visiting you there,"" came Legolas' clear voice. ""You concentrate on your shooting, Elfling,"" Elrohir called back. ""My King, you think Legolas is fit to lecture you but we are not?"" There was a shout of, ""Ready!"" from Aragorn, then by a faint tinkle and the thunk of metal hitting metal, followed by scattered cries of appreciation from the watching men. ""Of course not,"" Thranduil said. ""I think that Legolas needs the example of two sensible and well-behaved ellyn like yourselves so that he may learn to conduct himself in a manner more befitting my heir. Would any other Prince have ridden to battle disguised as his father?"" At Elrohir's incredulous look, he said, "" I am a King who rode to battle disguised as my son. That is entirely different."" The twins were laughing so helplessly that they failed to see Legolas pull off the blindfold and turn to face them, eyes gleaming with mischief as he took another arrow from his quiver.

353,2,24,2-Jedi-Sapphire-24.txt,lord-of-the-rings,JediSapphire,"excited squeals from the children. Gimli hesitated over his next words. Most spells he had heard used were in the Elven tongues. Even the spell that held the gates of Moria had required a Sindarin word. But although he could speak some Sindarin, he doubted he could manage it well enough to deceive Elboron, who had been encouraged by both his parents to spend as much time as he chose among the Elves of Ithilien and consequently spoke the language of the Sindar as well as he spoke Westron and Rohirric. What of it? He was a Dwarf, and he would use Dwarven words for his spell. If Legolas did not like it, the fool Elf might give him more warning another time. He hissed, the Khuzdul word for wolf , making Elladan's eyes narrow in mild disapproval. Elves had a fear of magic in other tongues, especially, according to Legolas, the Noldor, who had been deceived in the past. ""Say it,"" Gimli urged the children. ""The more you speak it, the stronger the magic."" Elfwine was the first to repeat the word, and the others began after him. Gimli followed with more Khuzdul words, and for some time all that was audible was childish voices repeating whatever Gimli said. Then, all of a sudden, the fire roared back to life. Elrohir, tall and broad-shouldered and very much still an Elf, stood exactly where he had been a moment before. Gimli frowned. ""It should have worked."" A sudden sharp squeak from one of the children made him turn. Éowyn, who had been standing beside Legolas, was gone. In her place was a large – large –wolf, with a shaggy grey coat and bright eyes and – Teeth like daggers. Gimli just managed not to shriek aloud. ""What… what happened ?"" he asked. ""Is it not obvious?"" Elladan's voice was suspiciously devoid of inflection. ""You must have been trying the spell on Legolas instead of Elrohir – one of your jokes, I expect, Master Gimli."" ""One of… my… jokes?"" ""I can only assume so. Unlike Elrohir, Legolas has no Mannish forefathers. I doubt the spells of mortals have any effect on those with none of the blood of mortals. So your spell, unable to act on its intended target, chose the nearest Mortal. Lady Éowyn."" ""One of my jokes?"" Gimli asked again. ""What else could it have been?"" Legolas asked. ""No matter. Once the children have satisfied themselves that the spell worked, you can reverse it and all will be as it was."" ""I… I can?"" None of the Elves responded, and everyone else appeared too stunned to speak. ""Uncle Legolas,"" Elboron said at last, ""is that… Is that my mother?"" ""You will have to ask Master Gimli that. Come and meet her."" Legolas' hand had dropped to the wolf's head. ""It is perfectly safe, I promise you."" At a discreet nod from Legolas, Faramir dropped to one knee beside the wolf and held out a hand. ""Éowyn."" The wolf – Éowyn, and Gimli could scarcely believe the Elves had actually gone that far – sniffed his fingers briefly, swiped her tongue across them, and then pressed her head up into Legolas' hand again. To Gimli's surprise, Elanor was the first of the children to dare to come forward. Sam looked nervous, but he said nothing. The wolf accepted Elanor's touch without demur, and it was not long before the other children were gathered around, gently patting her and hurling excited questions at Gimli. Fortunately, they did not wait for any answers. Legolas kept a watchful eye on the wolf and the children. After a few minutes, when it appeared to Gimli that the wolf was growing restive, he said, ""Master Gimli, how long is it safe to allow the spell to continue?"" Gimli took the hint. ""Ah. Er… Yes. We should stop. Form a circle again. And… Lady Éowyn, if you would stand…"" Legolas gestured subtly. ""Beside Legolas! Please stand beside Legolas. The… ah… the angle. That is the correct angle."" Gimli had no idea if the wolf understood him, but it went to Legolas and stood quietly to heel. He did as he had done earlier, waving his axe handle and trying to give everyday Khuzdul the sound of arcane magic. He did not ask the children to repeat after him, this time; he feared to provoke the wolf. He had his eyes on the wolf instead of Legolas, and so it took him by surprise when the room was plunged into darkness. He thought he heard growling, but it was low enough that he might have imagined it. When the fire lit itself again, Éowyn was standing between Legolas and Faramir, eyes bright with mirth. ""Master Gimli,"" she said breathlessly, ""that was delightful."" That, Gimli thought sourly, was certainly true, since Éowyn was the only one, other than the Elves, who appeared to understand what was happening. ""And now,"" Faramir said firmly to the children, ""it is time for bed. I think you have all had enough excitement for one day."" ""But Father –"" ""Uncle Faramir, it is still early –"" ""Lord Faramir,"" Elanor began sweetly. Faramir held up a hasty hand to forestall her. ""If you go to bed now, quietly , Master Gimli will go with you and tell you another story."" Gimli, who had just been thinking of a happy evening spent in the company of friends with foaming tankards of good ale, choked. ""Faramir!"" But it was too late. Elanor's wide eyes had turned on him. "" Please , Uncle Gimli."" ""Oh, very well,"" Gimli muttered, ignoring the snickering from Pippin. ""I will tell you a story."" He stumped out of the room, herding the children ahead of him, waiting until he was standing in the doorway to say, ""What do you say to the story of Faramir and his pet dragon?"" He shut the door on Faramir's startled protest and the sound of Éowyn's laughter. What did you think? Good? Bad? Please review!"

Thranduil said nothing, but he continued to advance. Elrond backed away until he felt the unyielding trunk of a tree behind him. ""Thranduil, he has been introducing himself all this while as only a member of the Fellowship, at best as an archer of your realm. I had to be certain. When even Mithrandir said he could not touch the Ring for fear of being tempted, when the Ring was being carried by a Halfling who would have been no match for even the most inexperienced of Elven warriors, I had to be certain that the representative of our race would not be tempted to take it."" Thranduil's lips twitched, but he did not smile. "" Our race? You are a Noldo."" Elrond let out a long breath. ""For now I lay claim to the Sindarin part of my lineage and ask you to refrain from spilling the blood of a kinsman."" Thranduil shrugged and tucked his knives into his belt again, but Elrond did not like his contemplative expression. ""So be it, then. I shall save my grievances against you to tell Celebrían when next I see her."" About to go, he turned with a smile that Elrond had seen all too often on Legolas' face and learnt to dread. ""Rest assured, I shall also be telling her the precise number of days Legolas had to spend away from his Ada and in daily peril of his life on account of your ineptitude."" ""Thranduil!"" Elrond protested, his voice almost a wail. Minas Tirith, Mid-Year's Day, Year 3019 of the Third Age ""Are all Elvish weddings like that?"" Pippin asked curiously as the Hobbits, Gimli and Legolas made their way up to their quarters. ""To an extent,"" Legolas responded with a smile. ""Although some of the rites we saw were those of the Dúnedain, not those of the Elves."" He reached up to adjust his hood, still uncertain whether the Men would welcome an Elf in their midst, although they all knew what he was now. ""Did you enjoy it, Master Peregrin?"" ""It was beautiful. I only wish Lord Elrond had not looked so sad at the end."" Three voices gave vent to loud, horrified whispers of, "" Pippin! "" as the young Hobbit's companions variously elbowed him and trod on his foot, while casting apologetic glances in the direction of the Elf. Legolas smiled. ""There is no need to torment him so. I am not offended. Lord Elrond was grieved, Master Peregrin, because he will soon sail for the Blessed Realm and he will then see his daughter no more."" That occasioned a sudden hush, broken at last by Gimli's gruff voice. ""And now I suppose you'll be eager to rush off to your ships and the other side of the Sundering Sea as well, Elf?"" Legolas was not in the least deceived by the studied indifference in his friend's tone. ""Indeed, no, Master Dwarf. I have heard the call of the Sea, but Aragorn has my word that I will wait out the years of his life in Middle-earth. You will all be able to enjoy my company for some time, I hope; but in the end I must sail to the Undying Lands, as must all my people, now that our time here has ended."" ""It will be a darker world without the fair folk,"" Pippin said in a small voice. ""Perhaps not that dark if there are some little folk to cheer it."" Legolas patted the Hobbit's shoulder. ""Come, my friend, this is no time for despondency. The Elves have little time left here as my people reckon things, but it will still be long years before my kind are no longer seen this side of the Sea."" By this time they had reached the corridor along which the Fellowship had their apartments. Legolas opened the first door to the left, stepping back to allow the Hobbits to stream in ahead of him. When they stopped short with gasps of shock and surprise, he followed, drawing a knife as he did. "" Sîdh , Thranduilion,"" a voice said. ""I have already been attacked by one member of the ruling line of Eryn Lasgalen this year. I have no desire to increase the tally."" ""Lord Elrond!"" Legolas slid his knife back into its sheath and stepped forward eagerly. ""You saw Ada ? How is he?"" ""He is very well, penneth ,"" the Elf-lord said. He glanced at the others before adding in Quenya, ""He is so energetic, in fact, that he nearly managed to decapitate me before I could persuade him that I had not been bribed by his enemies to send you on the quest."" Legolas heard a soft chuckle behind him, and turned to see Elladan and Elrohir in the doorway. "" You I will send to Thranduil to explain yourselves,"" the Elf-lord growled. ""So you need not be so amused, my foolish sons. But that I can accomplish once everything has calmed down. You , on the other hand, Legolas, are returning home to your father this very day!"" ""But my lord –"" "" No buts!"" Elrond snapped. ""If I had not been quick on my feet your father would have had my ears! You will get on a horse today ; whether you do so willingly or unwillingly is your choice."" Legolas felt a tug on his elbow. ""I think we should go,"" Elrohir hissed in his ear. ""Give Ada time to calm down."" In less than a second the three ellyn had vanished, leaving behind four astonished Hobbits, an amused Dwarf, and one very angry Elf-lord.

The Elf's fingers found the tree trunk. ""I am not permitted to ask you for help or suggest that you offer it… But I am free to seek the assistance of trees and birds and animals and opposing teams."" ""None of which I am."" ""No, but if I spoke to the tree and gave it a task, and you later happened to speak to the same tree and offered to help…"" ""And the opposing teams?"" Glorfindel asked. ""How do we obtain their aid?"" Legolas laughed. ""In truth, my lord, I rather think they might be assisting each other against us ."" ""Should I be worried?"" Legolas only patted the tree and smiled. Corollary to Rule Number Nine: Although permitted, it is considered bad form to ask trees to drop opposing players. ""Lady Arwen!"" Arwen turned, trying to suppress her guilty flush. Lord Thorontur was frowning at her. ""You should not be here. It is not entirely safe, and Master Elrond did not want you participating."" ""I am not participating,"" Arwen assured him. ""I am only here to observe. Legolas explained that it is forbidden for non-participants to render any form of assistance –"" ""I do not doubt he did,"" Thorontur interrupted. ""And I have trained young warriors long enough to know that they are always trying to find ways to see how far they can bend the rules."" He smiled. ""In truth, I encourage it. This is not a game. It is training, and the Enemy will adhere to no code of conduct. All the same, I cannot allow you to risk injury."" ""But if I choose to walk in the woods…"" Arwen trailed off when she realized there was no point. ""Why did Legolas send you here?"" ""He said there was no rule against giving his treasure to a non-participant, provided he can produce it at the end of the game."" Thorontur laughed. ""You do not have it, do you?"" Arwen could not help smiling. ""I do not."" ""I will tell you a secret, Lady Arwen."" The older Elf's answering smile was conspiratorial. ""It has been decades – possibly centuries – since Rochendilwen realized that, and my young warriors have been following that principle ever since. If I were to guess, I would say that all three of them have entrusted their treasures to whatever birds could carry them, and they are safely in high nests where Elven hands can never reach."" ""Why?"" ""Victory has never been the point of Esgalorne. What I want is to see how well they do tracking, how quick they are on the draw, and how easily they can conceal themselves in the trees. I can see that just as well without them taking the trouble of carrying the daggers about."" ""But then… When will it end?"" ""That depends. Today it will end when I have decided they have exhausted themselves enough that they will keep out of trouble tomorrow."" Somewhere in the forest, there was a thump and a torrent of mingled Sindarin, Quenya and Westron that made Arwen's eyes widen. Even Thorontur looked impressed. ""I had no idea your brother could question an Elf's parentage in that many languages."" ""My father will have his ears if he hears."" ""We will be grateful, then, that he cannot."" Thorontur cocked his head, listening. ""If they have already progressed to having each other flung to the ground, I will be able to call a halt soon. I doubt your father's healers want to deal with broken bones."" Rule Number Ten: If, after a reasonable time has passed, no team has claimed victory, the judges may, at their discretion, call an end to the exercise. ""I am not sorry it is over,"" Rochendilwen sighed. ""I thought it would be easier here, with so few participants, but it was more complicated. And those treacherous trees!"" ""The trees in Eryn Galen are just as biased in Legolas' favour,"" protested Elrohir. ""Aye,"" Saeldur said. ""But we expect it of them ."" ""Where is Legolas, in any case?"" Rochendilwen muttered, pushing away her untouched wine. ""What could the King possibly want with him that could take this long?"" ""I am sure he is perfectly safe,"" Elrohir said. ""Elladan went with him, and it is unlikely any harm could come to anyone in the middle of a council in Imladris."" Rochendilwen grimaced. ""Oh, I know he will be safe. I just…"" ""I know,"" Saeldur said as she trailed off. ""I am not happy about it either."" Almost on cue, the door to the sitting-room opened, and Elladan entered, closely followed by Legolas. Elrohir, Saeldur and Rochendilwen all spoke at once, demanding what had happened, but Elladan only shook his head. ""You do not want to know."" Legolas nodded assent. ""I think they only summoned us to put an end to the exercise before one of the Men was injured –"" ""And of course when the Master of Imladris and the King of the Woodland Realm decide to invent reasons to keep us occupied they can be most ingenious,"" Elladan finished. ""So long as that is all it was,"" Saeldur said. Legolas met his eyes, and Elrohir was surprised to see something like apology in the Elf-prince's gaze. ""I would not willingly have made you wait. I know how you feel about it."" ""At least you were finally allowed to leave,"" Saeldur went on with a wry smile, earning a laugh from Legolas. In response to Elladan's questioning glance, he added, ""We were released from our oaths – Rochendilwen and I – for the duration of the exercise."" Elrohir understood. Eryn Galen was a kingdom at war. Abruptly, Saeldur scrambled out of his chair and dropped to one knee. Rochendilwen followed a moment later. Neither spoke, but the bows that were held up for Legolas to take said more than words could. THE END What did you think? Good? Bad? Please review!"

""There is nothing to forgive, Estel,"" Legolas said quietly, his eyes not quite returning to the present. Estel reached tentatively for his friend; Legolas turned to face him, his blue eyes sparkling in the darkness, and then Estel had flung himself into the prince's arms and was sobbing into his tunic. He felt Legolas sigh heavily, and he had to laugh through his tears. ""I only want to help you,"" the Elf said. "" Istón. "" ""Tell me what troubles you."" ""You will leave,"" Estel whispered. "" Ada says I must be King of Men one day but if I do, that will herald the end of the days of the Elves… And all whom I love will sail into the West, leaving me to face the burden of kingship… Alone."" ""You will not be alone –"" ""I know . I know I will be King and there will presumably be a Queen and there will be a Steward and captains and councilors but there will be nobody left from now . Estel will be dead, dead , and there will only be Aragorn son of Arathorn, King of Gondor and Arnor."" "" No, Estel,"" Legolas said patiently. ""You will not be alone because I will be there."" Estel pulled away and sat up, staring at his friend in shock. ""Legolas –"" ""Did you think I would sail to Valinor and just leave you here? As long as you draw breath, gwador nîn , I will stay in Middle-earth – if you want me to, of course."" "" Want you to!"" For the second time that night a sobbing human flung himself at a startled Elven prince. ""Estel?"" Legolas sounded concerned, as well he might. ""What if you feel the Sea-Longing?"" Estel mumbled. ""Like Lady Celebrían?"" Legolas smiled, patting the human's back. ""Lady Celebrían left because she knew her family would eventually follow, and it would be a short enough time by Elvish reckoning before she saw them again. If she'd had a dimwitted human gwador to worry about I think she might have found the will to stay."" Estel swatted half-heartedly at the Elf's head. ""Legolas?"" ""Yes?"" ""I'm twenty."" ""I know , Estel,"" the Elf muttered, and the young human could sense his friend rolling his eyes. ""You have told me at least thirty times every day that you are an adult and –"" ""How small were you when you were twenty?"" Legolas looked surprised. ""In Elven years, you mean?"" ""Yes."" The blond archer chuckled. ""Small enough for Dan and Ro to tuck me in at night and tell me bedtime stories – they came up with some interesting ones, even better than my parents."" Estel grinned. ""Did your ada mind?"" ""Not really."" Estel could hear the laughter in his friend's voice. ""It was what they taught me during the day that Ada minded."" ""Legolas?"" ""Yes?"" ""Would it be very childish of me to ask you to – that is – I don't want to return to my room alone –"" Estel stopped short, and Legolas' Elven eyes could make out the reddening of his face even in the darkness. He smiled and got to his feet, pulling the human with him. ""Come along, penneth . You shouldn't be out here in the rain in any case. I will sit with you until you fall asleep."" ""I don't want to see Ada and Dan and Ro just yet… I'll talk to them in the morning."" Legolas nodded. ""I seem to remember a fairly sturdy vine growing on the wall beside your balcony. Let's see if it can support a fat human."" It was evening once more, and Estel and the twins had just bidden Legolas farewell at the gates of Imladris. In the ever-darkening forest that had once been Greenwood the Great, thousands of Elves relied on their King and his warriors to hold darkness at bay with the bow and the blade. But even as Estel looked at the road down which his friend had ridden away, he found it in his heart to be merry. Distance was nothing, on the same side of the Sea; and the good thing about Gondor was that there would be no Hithaeglir separating him from his friend. And perhaps this would be their greatest adventure of all. Leaving his brothers, he went to walk in the woods. Legolas had taught him to find comfort in the spreading branches of beech and oak, and he had long entertained a foolish notion that if he gave messages to the trees they would be borne somehow across the leagues and whispered to an Elven prince fighting to bring some measure of security to his father's people. Smiling, and comfortable in the knowledge that there were no Elves to hear him and laugh at his singing, he raised his voice in the Lay of Lúthien. And behold! there Lúthien walked before his eyes in Rivendell, clad in a mantle of silver and blue, fair as the twilight in Elven-home; her dark hair strayed in a sudden wind, and her brows were bound with gems like stars. - From The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen Sindarin Translations Aran – King Calo anor na ven! – May the sun shine on your road!

Any Elf-lord would be honoured to have you for his wife."" ""I do not desire an Elf-lord, my love. I desire you ."" ""I am not worthy,"" Estel whispered. ""You are. You have proven yourself the equal of the noblest of Elves in courage and strength of heart. You are no less in valour and might than Beren, who claimed the heart of my foremother – our foremother – Lúthien, or Túor, who wooed and won Idril Celebrindal.""

Brave Greenleaf 'neath the spreading trees, Both Mirkwood's strength and Mirkwood's cheer, I hear your voice upon the breeze. You say, ""My brother, I am here."" -- Eriador, Year 2998 of the Third Age It was in an unwonted silence that the Chieftain of the Dúnedain and the Prince of Greenwood walked out of the Ranger camp, the Elf leading his horse by the bridle. Aragorn sank into the loosely-packed snow with every step he took. Despite his disgruntlement, habit made him forget he was sulking long enough to cast a glance at the light Elven shoes that barely made an impression on the white surface. He barely managed to stifle his laughter when the mare did the same thing, snorting her disapproval as she tried and failed to replicate the feat. Legolas reached out automatically to brush the bark of a gnarled old tree with his fingertips as they passed it. The familiar gesture from the Elf made Aragorn's throat tighten when he realized he would not see it in the months to come. ""Do you have to go?"" As soon as the words were out, he flushed at how childish the question sounded. He half-expected Legolas to laugh at him, but the Elf stopped and turned to face him. The incongruous sight of the blond archer wearing only a light cloak over his tunic while snowflakes gathered on his eyelashes did make Aragorn chuckle. Legolas grinned at him in amusement. ""This does not mean you're forgiven,"" Aragorn said, his tone admonitory. ""I still say you should not have done it."" ""And I say I should,"" Legolas replied equably. ""I am not an Elfling, Estel."" ""You cannot risk your life for my sake like that, you dim-witted Edhel !"" ""I risk my life for my father's people every day,"" Legolas pointed out. ""But you might have been killed! And I am only a Man."" ""Precisely my point, Dúnadan. You Men are absolutely no good at taking care of yourselves. What would you have done if I hadn't saved you? You practically go looking for trouble!"" ""That's rich, coming from you !"" ""Don't change the subject,"" Legolas said sternly. ""You needed my help, and so I helped you, as you would have done for me."" ""Don't you understand , Legolas? I am mortal ."" ""I know that, Dúnadan,"" the Elf-prince responded in the tone of one being forced to conduct a conversation with the village idiot. ""I fail to see your point."" ""My point, you orc-brained, thick-skulled lackwit of a Sinda, is that I am mortal and you cannot risk your life for me because... because..."" Aragorn trailed off, looking helplessly into Legolas' quizzical face. ""Why do you do it, Legolas?"" ""You are my gwador . What is your point, Estel?"" Aragorn had expected to be told that he was the equal of any Elf-lord; for a moment, he was nonplussed. Then he laughed, throwing his arms around his friend in a quick hug. ""Never mind, Elfling. Thank you."" He laughed harder when Legolas grumbled and grimaced at having to hug an over-tunic, a coat, a cloak and the ends of a muffler along with the Ranger. ""When will you return?"" he asked when the Elf finally drew back. ""Whenever you want me, mellon n î n ."" Legolas mounted his horse. ""Send word to Imladris if you do. Lord Elrond will know how to reach me."" He graced Aragorn with an impish grin. ""Next time I should teach you to talk to birds. That would save trouble all round."" Aragorn squeezed his friend's hand and stepped back. Legolas touched his heels lightly to the horse's sides. She tossed her head, and then horse and rider were gone in a flurry of snow. Aragorn stood looking after them for a moment, a small smile on his face, before he turned to return to the camp.

All Saeldur does, though, is clutch at my arm to anchor himself. I hold my breath, hoping Saeldur has not noticed Eredhion's movement. It is a vain hope. Saeldur is a trained warrior. Even distraught as he is, he turns slightly in the direction of the sound. He lets out a sharp, bitter laugh when he sees Eredhion, still with his hand on his sword. ""You still think I will hurt Legolas?"" ""Saeldur,"" I begin, but he shakes his head. ""I suppose I deserve no better."" He takes a step back, holding up empty hands. ""I have no weapons. I am sworn to defend Legolas –"" ""That did not stop you from nearly killing him –"" "" Eredhion! "" I snap. ""That is uncalled for."" Saeldur's pleading gaze turns to me. ""I would never hurt you."" ""I know."" ""Legolas may know,"" Eredhion growls. ""I do not. I find it highly improbable that one of our finest warriors failed to notice that he had a sharpened blade –"" ""Eredhion,"" I say firmly. ""That will do."" ""As you say, my prince."" Eredhion does not sound at all repentant, but he lets the subject drop. I will accept that for now. The trees are quick to confirm Eglos' report, and calm enough that I know they are not trying to hide more difficult news. I heave a silent sigh of relief. As confident as I tried to appear for Saeldur's sake, I have been worried. I give the beech a pat, feeling its faint thrum of appreciation before I make my way back across the training fields. Saeldur, Eredhion and Voronwë trail behind me to the hall of the Colhador, where Colfind is the duty officer. ""We need to send out an escort – two archers."" I glance at Saeldur. ""Do you want to ride with them?"" ""Please."" I nod, turning back to Colfind. ""Send for two of the archers, whoever is standing by today. Saeldur will lead them."" I glance at Saeldur. ""I expect they are no more than four or five hours' ride away by now. All the same, I would advise hastening them further. All things considered, it will be best if they are within the stronghold by dusk."" Colfind inclines his head briefly before going off to issue the orders. I cross the hall to the small council chamber at the other end. Saeldur comes with me. I glare at Eredhion and Voronwë to prevent them from following. For once they obey, and I shut the door firmly before turning to my friend. He has dropped into a chair, head buried in his hands. I crouch beside him and squeeze his knee. ""I cannot lose her."" His voice is a desperate whisper. ""Not now. Not so soon after Candnaur. I cannot lose her."" ""Nobody is losing anybody. Nobody is hurt."" ""Will you come with me now?"" ""Saeldur –"" ""Please, Legolas. I know they are in no danger, but if something should happen… Orcs, spiders, I do not dare say any part of the forest is safe. Not now. There is nobody whose hand I trust more on the bow. Please."" Rochendilwen is away. Aeroniel is nursing a broken collarbone. If Saeldur and I both leave – "" Please , Legolas."" We will only be a few hours from the stronghold, after all. ""I will come,"" I say, patting Saeldur's knee. ""You will not go,"" Eredhion says flatly. ""Not alone."" ""I thought we were past this."" I check the last of the arrows the armourers delivered this morning, sliding a couple of handfuls into my quiver. ""We will be in a safe area. There is no danger."" ""It is not that sort of danger we mean and you know it."" Voronwë seizes my knives and tests the blades before handing them back to me. ""It is your responsibility to fight the Shadow in these woods, Legolas. We would never keep you from your duty. You know that. But it is no part of your duty to put yourself in peril of a knife to the back, and it is no part of our duty to permit it."" ""I thought we all agreed that Saeldur could be trusted."" ""No, you said Saeldur could be trusted and we agreed that he was unlikely to have intended you harm."" ""That was not what you said earlier."" Eredhion has the grace to blush. ""I said more than I should have earlier. But the fact remains that, intentional or not, Saeldur has proven to have a regrettable lack of judgement in difficult situations."" ""That was my fault as much as it was his."" I hold out my hands for Voronwë to tighten my vambraces. ""I could have handled it better."" ""Saeldur could have avoided insubordination. No, Legolas. If you are going, we are coming with you. That is our last word on the matter."" ""Saeldur will think –"" ""That they do not trust me?"" comes Saeldur's voice from the doorway. I wince and turn to the door, protest ready on my lips. Saeldur waves it aside. ""They are wise not to trust me again so soon. I would not, in their position."" He comes into my room, ignoring Voronwë and Eredhion and patting me lightly on the shoulder. ""You have the luxury of forgetting wrongs done to you, Legolas. The Royal Guard does not."" He glances at my guards. ""Come, if you please, but do you truly think Legolas could not defend himself if I did decide to attack him?"" ""I do not doubt Legolas' ability to ward of a frontal attack,"" Voronwë says flatly. ""Voronwë,"" I say as calmly as I can, ""this is not helping. I will not try to prevent you from coming. I will not force you to choose between my orders and your… duty. But there will be no arguing."" What did you think? Good? Bad? Please review!"

""All he has done since we told him of our intent has been to argue against it."" ""He is your father, Ro,"" Legolas said mildly. ""He came very close to losing your mother and he probably fears to lose you if you embark on a quest to destroy yrch . You remember how Ada was after Nana died... Lord Elrond will come around if you give him time."" ""Then we fight,"" Elrohir said, and if Legolas felt any misgivings at the sight of the odd, feral gleam in his friends' eyes, he kept them to himself. ""Yes, gwedyr ,"" he said. ""You fight... We fight. Whether the battles are fought in the passes of the Hithaeglir or beneath the trees of Eryn Galen, the war is the same, and each orc felled is a blow, however minor, against the Enemy. We fight."" As he spoke, the first light of the rising sun shone through the open balcony door, casting its bright golden light on the three young Elves.

""Legolas?"" ""Yes?"" ""How long will you stay in Middle-earth after I have passed?"" The Elf hesitated, sensing some unknown intent to the question. At last he said honestly, ""I do not know, Estel. I have not felt the Sea-longing, and I love the trees of my home. I would like to linger here, where I may have comfort from the forest and from the memories of our time together. I cannot say how many years it will be before I can bring myself to leave. But all this may change if ever I feel the call of the Sea."" ""Yet the time of the Elves is ending."" ""So it is."" "" Ada will sail before you do... I doubt he will wait out my years."" ""He longs to be with Lady Celebrían. I believe he only stays here for your sake, and because he believes he has yet some part to play in the fate of Middle-earth. But he has waited for centuries; mayhap when you have claimed the throne of Men he will be persuaded to wait long enough to see your days of glory."" ""I would not ask that of him,"" Aragorn said softly. ""For if I claim the throne of Men, Arwen will choose the Doom of Men to cleave to me. I would not have him stay to see her die."" Legolas ran one hand gently over his friend's head. ""I had hoped Nana would live to see light restored to the world."" ""Perhaps she will know and rejoice, wherever she is."" ""What would happen if I failed, Legolas?"" ""Darkness would grow,"" the Elf said softly. ""The Elves would die, or be taken, or pass into the West. One by one the kingdoms of Men would fall until all Middle-earth was in thrall to Sauron."" ""Yet those whom I love would still be safe. Nana is safe now, as I would be; Ada and Dan and Ro and Arwen would have gone to the Blessed Realm; you might linger, you say, but eventually you would take ship and leave these shores."" ""What of your people?"" ""There will be another to fight for them."" ""There may be another,"" Legolas agreed. ""There may be twenty others. But these others are all unknown and in the future. Today there is you, Estel."" ""Hope,"" Aragorn almost growled. ""Aye, the Hope of Men. How did that help Nana , Legolas? I was not at her side when she passed, nor was I present to see that she was buried with honour. In doing my duty to the race of Men I forsook my duty to my mother. And now... What if I should be busy waging war in some forsaken corner of Middle-earth and suddenly receive word that Dan or Ro had been killed while out with the Rangers, or you had taken some mortal wound from a spider?"" ""Then you will grieve for us and go on."" ""You value my friendship little if you think I would forget you so easily,"" Aragorn snapped, pulling away from the Elf. "" S î dh, mellon n î n ... Forgive me; that was not what I meant. We are all warriors, Estel, and we are called upon to make sacrifices, of which our own lives are usually the least. But I will not speak to you now of your duty or your ancestors. Think, instead, that a time may come when you and I can walk freely into a village, in a world not marred by the Shadow, sit in an inn without hiding our faces and partake of that foul beverage of which you are so fond. Is the chance of that not worth the risks we take?"" ""The chance of seeing you 'partake of that foul beverage'?"" Aragorn asked, unable to repress a grin. ""I would pay in gold to see it, Sinda."" He bent forward to wrap his arms around his friend in a strong, brotherly embrace. ""When did you grow so wise, Elfling?"" "" You spend a few months buoying the spirits of young warriors who are all but ready to put down their bows and give in to despair,"" Legolas responded, forcing himself not to laugh.

Meg stared at the bounty spread before her, then at her guardian, who with a graceful gesture made plain that she was to help herself, and then she finally turned a puzzled look to the brown man. ""I'm… I'm a trespasser, caught breaking in, and he's feeding me?"" ""It has been a long… long time… that we have not seen strangers in our midst,"" the brown man chuckled again and moved to claim one of the remaining chairs, ""but the traditions of this House are venerable and to be honored regardless. No one who finds this place is refused shelter."" He sat and watched her for a long moment, during which Meg didn't dare move. ""Go ahead,"" he urged, his lilt almost musical, ""this repast is for you."" With a shaking hand, Meg took a few of the berries and put them on her plate and then sipped cautiously at the water in the mug, only to find it sweet and almost cold. ""Who… what is… I'm confused."" The tall man settled himself in the remaining chair with an astonishing grace, and the woman seemed to bustle about the kitchen to supply him with the same dining equipment as had been placed before Meg. He stated something in that musical language that held no resemblance at all to anything spoken by the natives in the villages nearby as he deftly sliced himself a thick slab of the bread and then revealed the unknown substance in the second small bowl as honey. Then, waving his doctored bread, he gestured, obviously telling the man in brown to relay his words. The man in brown asked a quick question, and then nodded at the curt response. ""He wishes to know how you have found this place."" Meg carefully set the mug back down on the table and directed her comments to her mysterious guardian. ""My… my brother and I saw it… from the air."" She waved a pointing finger in a small circle over her head. ""We decided to come investigate what he thought were ruins."" No sooner had the words left her lips but the brown man was speaking in that musical tongue. Immediately her silver-haired captor asked something else, and then gestured for his words to be translated. He looks as if he's someone used to calling the shots , Meg thought to herself with a shudder. ""And where is your brother? Is he elsewhere on the grounds?"" She shook her head. ""No. I'm alone."" Grey eyes from both men studied her face with a sharp intelligence that looked to miss very little. ""Your brother did not accompany you after all?"" was the next translated question. ""My brother is dead."" Meg couldn't help the flat tone in her voice. It still hurt to even think that she would never hear Gene's laugh, or be the butt of one of his jokes… The expression on the face of the man who had been her captor and guardian changed immediately as her answer was translated. The stony look vanished, and she found herself looking at deep compassion and concern. The question uttered then was one couched in worried tones. ""Did he suffer mishap on your journey here? Should we send for help to fetch him?"" the brown man translated urgently. Meg shook her head and closed her eyes. ""No. He died long before I came looking for these buildings. I just…"" She wiped at the tears that never failed to slip onto her cheeks when she thought about Gene for long. ""He was so excited and intrigued when he saw your roof; and he wanted so badly to see just what was going on here. I came because… because I know he wanted to come."" She was startled when the huge hand that had taken control of her elbow earlier reached out and gently covered her hand for a moment as it rested on the table. The deep bell-like voice chimed again. ""Then we share in your grief, Lady, and are glad that you are come in his memory,"" the brown man quickly translated. The statement was both a comfort and a cause for confusion. ""Glad?"" Meg turned to the brown man. He smiled at her. ""This place has always been a refuge, ever since its founding. While we do not often entertain guests anymore, we still honor the old ways. And while we are… surprised… that you found your way here, the tradition is that all those who manage to make their way here are never turned away. Please…"" he gestured to the table and its contents, ""eat a bit, while Norwen makes arrangements for your stay with us."" Meg's eyes widened. ""But… I don't want to intrude, or be a…"" ""Nonsense! We are honored to be allowed to once more serve our purpose in the world."" ""But…"" She frowned. ""But… What is this place? Who are you people?"" The brown man nodded wryly. ""Yes. I suppose introductions are in order, are they not? This,"" he gestured at the tall, silver-haired aristocrat seated at the table with her, ""is Lord Celeborn, also known as The Wise."" The tall man nodded at her, probably guessing the substance of the English and yet relinquishing not a bit of his regal bearing. ""The lady preparing the evening meal, who is no longer here while she arranges for chambers for you, is Norwen. My name, in the Grey Tongue, is Radagast - although you may call me Wendell, as many of those in the villages do. It comes from one of my other names."" ""I'm Meg - Meg Litten,"" she returned with a shy smile. His ""other"" names? How many names does he have ? Wendell looked around the kitchen, his gaze obviously meant to indicate the entire settlement, and then back down at her with warmth and friendliness. ""Well then, Meg Litten, welcome to Imladris."""

Thranduil pushed himself away and stood abruptly, and she knew she had probably disappointed him. ""But that is not to say that others might not be more knowledgeable than I, and more willing to tell you what you want to know."" From the swish of the robes, she knew he'd turned quickly. ""What?"" Elara pushed away from the table and slowly rose to her feet. ""I'm sorry, Thranduil, but I'm tired and ready to be done with the day. Is there any way for you to let Míriel know that I'm just going to lie down without waiting for her?"" She heard the King open the apartment door and speak in a low voice to someone outside, and then close the door again. ""Is there anything I can do for you – other than hand you the willowbark tea once you're down?"" ""Yes."" She reached out a hand into the empty air and, after a long moment, felt a huge hand take it and interweave fingers together. ""You can stop fussing and plotting revenge. I'm safe; I'm fed; I have a headache, but I'll survive; and another scar on a face with so many already will not be much of an issue. You managed not to kill the men from Esgaroth, and I believe got the agreement from them that you wanted as well, yes?"" ""Yes…"" he drew out in exasperation. She smiled at where she knew he stood. ""Then all is good with the world – and I can go to bed with a clear conscience. In which case, you can put in an appearance at the Great Hall before everything is finished for the evening after all, and maybe quash a few more new ugly rumors before they get started."" All of a sudden, she was gathered close and held while Thranduil laughed quietly. ""You are impossible, Elara, daughter of Vardon, wood-gatherer of Dale, talking the evil and ferocious and cruel Elvenking of deepest, darkest, scariest Mirkwood out of his rage so easily! What magic do you wield that you take on such a formidable opponent without fear?"" ""I have no need to fear him – for, you see, contrary to popular belief, the Elvenking is a very kind person who will not do anyone any harm without good reason,"" she smiled into his chest. Thranduil smelled of fresh forests and sweet, new-cut grass, and his arms were strong and gentle around her. She had rarely felt so safe and protected in her life as she did at that moment, and she would treasure the memory that he would have killed to protect her deep in her heart to the end of her days. ""And there are times – like right now – that I fear that I might learn to like him too well,"" she added in a whispered confession. ""He would fear the same."" Thranduil whispered into the top of her head, ""except for two small things. First, he knows that you would no more dishonor the memory of your husband than he would the memory of his wife. And most importantly,"" he chuckled very softly, ""he knows he is far too old for you."" ""You're right,"" she agreed with a soft sigh. It was easy to forget, sometimes, that Thranduil really was unbelievably ancient – he always seemed so irrepressibly filled with life and vigor that she couldn't help but be fascinated by his sheer power of will and challenged to keep up with him mentally. And it was also true that, as much as she was beginning to find herself quite fond of the Elvenking, nobody would ever touch her soul the way Timon had. She pushed away from him as a knock at the door announced Míriel's arrival. ""Thank you for all you've done for me today, Sire,"" she finished formally, now that there were other ears in the room. ""Thank you for my life – again."" She felt him lean toward her again, and an impossibly light kiss brushed her forehead. ""Goodnight, Elara,"" Thranduil said, his voice low and warm; and then, with a soft word to Míriel, the King was gone. oOoOo ""Have you and Thranduil come to an agreement then?"" Míriel asked as she unlaced Elara's gown and carefully pulled it over her head without dislodging the bandage. ""Not so much an agreement as an understanding,"" Elara replied with a smile. Míriel chuckled. ""My sister learned the benefit of looking for understandings more than agreements early on,"" she adjusted the sleeping gown and then led Elara to the bed to comb out her hair and braid it. ""She often told me that Thranduil is far more manageable with understandings than with outright agreements sometimes – although she admitted that it made their arguments very trying."" ""Your sister?"" ""Yes. Lalaith – Thranduil's wife – was my older sister. After I married Randirion and came to live with the Sindar, we spoke many times about the best way to manage our head-strong husbands."" Elara's jaw dropped, and Míriel chuckled softly. ""You see, my dear, those of us who know him well, including family, are not threatened by your moving into these rooms – and many who wonder will look to us for signs of disapproval before causing trouble. They will listen to me, to Randirion, to Tarion and Anariel, far more closely than they'll listen to the likes of Giluín or Auriel. Besides, Randirion and I have our apartment only a few doors down from here – this move means that we'll be able to visit back and forth much more often now. When you're feeling better, I'll have to show you how to find us on your own. Thranduil's right – you will be much safer here, with us."" Then Míriel gently handed a completely bemused Elara the cooled mug of willowbark tea – and when that was gone, sat on the edge of the bed to sing her to sleep. FIN"
362,2,3,2-Aearwen22-3.txt,lord-of-the-rings,Aearwen22,"responsibility to be left behind while his beloved took ship. ""It must be this way, or my own hopes are in vain."" Galadriel's hand reached out and touched Elrond's upper arm in a mirror action to his. ""She will be there, and she will be healed, as you say, so that she can be your anchor and strength while you are healed yourself,"" she promised. ""The Valar would not ask so much of you – take so much from you – and then deprive you of your solace when you come to them having finished all they asked of you."" Elrond struggled against the pressing desire to weep, and finally swallowed hard to tamp the tears back down. He let his gaze rest on the western horizon without striving to see beyond it. ""You know, I wonder now if the endless hours of the Straight Path, where all around us is almost as empty as the Void itself, exists so that we have a chance to think through the purpose of our lives in Arda. If we are wise, we can use the time to settle that part of our lives that is finished now, so we can leave everything belonging to that world behind us when we step ashore in Valinor."" ""If we are wise,"" Galadriel repeated his words. ""A very conditional opportunity – so fitting with the nature of the Valar."" ""If you say so,"" Elrond shrugged. ""You know them better than I do."" Again her lips quirked with a hint of a smile. ""Perhaps, and perhaps not. You forget that even I followed Fëanor, although I did so as much out of loyalty to my father's choice as anything else. I am nothing if not a rebel. What I best know of the Valar is that against which I set my fate and my hopes long ago."" A chilled breeze caught at hair and robes, and Elrond shivered as a heavy mist settled over the water and the ship. The endless silver sea had vanished, and even the stern face of the carved swan on the prow above his head was lost to sight in the mist. Sounds of consternation and then distress began arising from those who had been too wearied or defeated to note anything else just moments earlier as the ship began to toss and turn as if upon a stormy deep; and, oddly enough, Elrond felt Galadriel's hand seeking and then slipping into his. Having nothing to offer her but his own unease, he closed his fingers around hers and, together, they stared forward into utter nothingness. Just when it seemed as if the ship were going to founder and swamp, the seas calmed again and the mist that had swallowed them started to thin. Elrond turned and saw the pale, frightened faces of his fellow passengers become visible again, finding many of them had found reason to cling together. A tiny sound from Galadriel made him glance down at where their hands were joined to discover that he was clinging so tightly to her that his knuckles were white. With a gasp of apology, he loosed her hand and saw some of the tightness in her expression immediately ease. ""Look!"" Elrond's head swiveled to find the owner of the voice, and then again to follow the extended finger that pointed forward. Beyond the prow, the mist had completely dissipated, and on the very edge of the silvery sea could be discerned a very thin, green line. He heard Galadriel gasp, and turned to see her leaning forward with a hand at her lips, her gaze both wistful and excited. ""Almost home!"" he heard her whisper to herself. ""Almost home,"" he whispered too. Somewhere, on that thin green line that was growing slowly but steadily closer on the horizon, was Celebrían. And from now on, wherever she was, that would be home for him, as it had always been meant to be. Already his heart was lighter with the sense of release from a Longing that had held him prisoner for so long that he could hardly remember a day without it. The losses he endured still ached desperately, however, as did the thought that he would have to share some of them with Celebrían. Nothing would ever change the fact that neither of them would ever see Arwen again, or that her brothers were remaining with her until her death before making up their minds if they would follow their parents or their sister and foster-brother. Vilya was still dead and suspended in a satin bag hanging from his neck, and the added stamina it had lent him for so long a gaping vacuum in his fae . He was still exhausted far more than he'd ever been in his very long life. But that thin line of green meant the greatest sorrow he'd ever faced was nearly finished, if all the tales of Elvenhome were true. Behind him, he heard the stir and then the voices of two sleepy hobbits, freshly roused from their slumber and guided to the deck by Mithra… Olórin. Bilbo sounded a little more animated than he had for years, and a quick glance at Frodo found a hint of color where pallor and illness had been before. All about them, those who had been sitting listlessly now stirred themselves, as if a corner of the pall of doom that had covered them had been lifted, letting the light of hope and healing penetrate slightly. They were not yet healed of the wounds they carried, but they knew themselves close to where such a thing could be found. As did Elrond. He straightened his back and brushed his hands down his robe. The time for doubt and worry had ended with the thinning of the mist over the ship. His future, as free from sorrow and strife as was possible, awaited him on those green and growing shores. The healer in him was ready to be healed."
363,2,8,2-Aearwen22-8.txt,lord-of-the-rings,Aearwen22,"do not walk this dark path where I cannot follow. Not yet!"" Elara lay in his arms, stunned. ""You're serious,"" she said after a long moment. ""I am."" A warm splash of wetness landed on her forehead that told her that her Elvenking - the proud, capricious, headstrong and arrogant ruler who had determinedly led his Elven Realm to survive Sauron's wrath with no help from anyone else - was weeping. ""I give you my oath, Elara; we can share our love even though we will never share a passion that would betray Lalaith. Do not so easily let go of this life, I beg you."" ""Thranduil."" His grief was tearing at her, and her own tears spilled freely onto her cheeks. ""I will walk that dark path one day, whether that day be tomorrow or many years from now. I am mortal; I will leave you someday. You knew this from the start."" ""I know,"" he gulped and cradled her cheek with a huge hand that was actually shaking as his thumb brushed at her tears. ""But many years from now, if you can but turn back to me, I will have a great share of memories of our time together to hold close and give me as much comfort as is possible to give to one who will miss you until the breaking of the world. But if you leave me now, not only will I miss you forever, but I will know that you left me far too soon, and that I am the cause of your death. I don't know..."" His voice broke, and Elara heard him swallow several times before he could continue. ""I don't know that I would long survive you in that case."" ""That isn't fair,"" she complained, her voice wavering. ""You have a realm that needs you strong and well, and alive. You should spend your time and energy on Eryn Lasgalen, not worry about a world-weary mortal woman who can't even see her hand before her own face. Don't make this harder for me than..."" ""Elara, hear me. My son will leave this world when Elessar dies. My wife left me two thousand years ago. My father, my brothers, they all left before that. Many whom I called friend either died in the War or left for the Havens with Galadriel. All whom I have loved best, except you and Legolas, are beyond my reach; and I am oath-bound to remain behind, no matter what else happens. The Valar gave you to me to give me the strength to hold on as the age of the Elves waned; and to teach me how to survive the last of the blows I must bear alone when Legolas takes the ship West. I know I have done a poor job of caring for you of late, but I beg one more opportunity to make things right."" Another warm splash from above hit her nose. ""I don't have the energy to keep the two of us alive,"" she whispered, overwhelmed. ""I can't even summon the strength to sit up and be angry with you for trying to shift responsibility for your life to me in this way."" ""I don't expect you to keep us both alive. I have more than enough strength for the both of us, if only you will try to accept what I'm offering,"" Thranduil whispered back, his lips against her hair. ""Please, my gift. Be angry with me if you must, but be angry here , in this world. Let me help you, let me help you get well again. Turn away from the path you are treading and come back to the light - and me. And once you are well, I will take you home with me where you belong, where your absence has been felt by others and not just me."" Home to Eryn Lasgalen, where the trees spoke to her willingly and protected her; where she had first found her place among the Elves. The very idea pulled at her heart. ""I would like to go home someday, Thranduil,"" she said very softly. ""Then we must make you well enough to endure the journey,"" the deep voice stated with emotion-thickened conviction, obviously working hard to find stability again. ""I sent word to Gondor about my intentions just before leaving for Ithilien. Aragorn should send word very soon with his ideas for aiding in your recovery, or I'll know the reason why."" Elara turned her face into his chest and sighed, feeling the weight of her grief fall away just a little. ""After all this time..."" she mused aloud, clutching at the suede as tightly as she could. ""I have missed you so."" Her voice broke again. ""And I have missed you, my gift - desperately."" His arms folded around her again, and he bent his lips to her ear. ""I love you, Elara nîn - and I always will, unto the breaking of the world and beyond. Never again will you go a day without hearing that, I swear it to you."" She opened her mouth to respond, and then paused - the words caught in her throat. ""I promised I would never say it again..."" ""I release you from that cruel oath, and everything else that we agreed that night,"" Thranduil growled into her ear. ""We shall make new oaths, you and I, better ones. But Valar forgive me, right now I need to hear you..."" She needed no further enticement, and the words sprang from her lips. ""I love you too, Thranduil - and I always will."" With that, the hole in her heart - the one that had bled loneliness and sorrow and stolen her will to live since the day she'd ridden away from Thranduil's hall - closed a bit. There was no promise that she could regain all that she had lost, but in that moment, in her Elvenking's arms, she knew she could but try. They both deserved another chance."

She breathed a sigh of gratitude when she discovered that he had led her back to the stump and then joined her in taking a seat again. ""How is it that I can hear you in my mind now?"" Strangely, she could feel the Elvenking's confusion and alarm as if it were her own. She can hear me? Yes . She felt him physically start at the response that never left her own mind. ""I have no idea,"" he finally responded aloud, the confusion she had felt within her as coming from him now obvious in his tone. ""This is not supposed to happen this way."" Elara trembled. If Thranduil is alarmed, something must indeed be wrong. ""Not wrong, exactly,"" he answered her thoughts as if she'd spoken them aloud. ""It's just that…"" He took a deep breath and then continued in total seriousness. ""For my kind, it usually takes bonding between ellon and elleth to bring two faer close enough to communicate in that fashion."" ""Bonding?"" Elara pulled away from him, her mind taking her into thoughts that made her face burn with the possibility that this was not another example of his wry, earthy sense of humor. ""What do you mean?"" ""Exactly what you're thinking,"" the King answered gently, as if sensing her discomfort and embarrassment. ""And yet…"" He paused as if listening in another direction. ""The bond with Lalaith is unbroken!"" he exclaimed with relief. This must be something else – something… ""Something that your son perhaps has with his mortal friends?"" Elara finished his thought for him aloud and then blushed at the surprise that poured from him once more. ""My apologies."" He took her hand again. ""No apology is necessary. It's just…"" He paused for a moment and then chuckled weakly. ""It's just going to take a while to get used to the idea."" His voice grew thick with memory. ""I haven't had anyone in my thoughts for a very long time – and even now, her voice in my mind grows fainter with every passing year."" ""I've never had anyone in my mind before,"" Elara said softly, squeezing the large hand holding hers. ""But I think I would have enjoyed hearing Timon's thoughts in this way."" Thranduil breathed in deeply, as if shaking himself free of his grief again. ""I think, however, you may be correct in pointing out that this may be something similar to the bond my son shares with his mortal friends – especially Elessar."" He covered their clasped hands with his free hand. ""I am once more convinced that you have been a gift to me from the Valar – for what I'm being rewarded, however, I'm not entirely certain. I haven't always thought kindly of them, as you can imagine."" As another long moment of peace stretched between them, Elara marveled that she could so clearly share the deep satisfaction and contentment of the Elvenking sitting next to her. He really doesn't mind this? He really doesn't, a deep voice whispered in her mind with a soft chuckle, and then became wistful. Do you? ""No,"" she answered truthfully after a long moment of examining her feelings. ""I suppose I don't. But like you, I think it's going to take a while to get used to."" For a long time they sat there, each trying to adjust to the sudden added dimension to their friendship and Elara still subtly aware of the deep pulsing that was the voice of the forest. Silent Elves brought them plates piled with fragrant herb breads, tangy slices of cheese, cakes made with nuts and berries gathered from the forest, and the juice of apples and berries mixed with wine. As time went on, the music around them eventually changed from choral paeans to Arda to a rousing instrumental reel, and the sound of gentle Elven laughter began to filter through the wood. ""Tell me, Lady,"" Thranduil asked finally, breaking their comfortable, companionable silence, ""in this day of strange beginnings, would you like to try something else new?"" ""What is that?"" ""A dance?"" Elara snorted. ""Surely you don't still think I can be taught to dance without causing a disaster, do you?"" He bent toward her, and his deep voice thrummed. ""Do you trust me not to let you fall?"" Thranduil's tone made Elara catch her breath, very aware of a new and fragile warmth between herself and the Elvenking that really couldn't bear close examination – ever. This was a precipice that neither of them dared approach any closer, and she knew they both were aware of it. That such a thing had been given even the briefest voice and been recognized by the both of them for what it was would have to suffice. Determined to lighten the mood with humor and steer the two of them away from danger, she shook her head and laughed softly. ""If you can trust me not to trip you and send you sprawling on your royal backside, I suppose I can trust you not to let me fall."" Thranduil burst into gales of laughter, and Elara found herself laughing with him in relief. She let him pull her back to her feet and, with a warm hand at her elbow, guide her to the center of the meadow to join with the others as they celebrated the One and the gifts they had been given. Together with the rest of Eryn Lasgalen, they danced long into the night. FIN Author's Note: I know that some believe that osanwe-kenta is the province of the elves alone However, I took my inspiration for this development between Elara and Thranduil from the essay Osanwe-kenta itself, where it is said in the very first paragraph: ""Of them Pengolodh says only, ""Men have the same faculty as the Quendi, but it is in itself weaker, and is weaker in operation owing to the strength of the hröa , over which most men have small control by the will."""

Aragorn shrugged and reached for his glove to take the now boiling cooking pot from the flames. ""That was Master Elrond's intent: convince the Dark Lord that the line of Isildur's heirs was broken, so that he would stop hunting me. But to do it properly, even I couldn't know. I was given another name - I didn't even answer to Aragorn until a little over a month ago. Even my own mother still slipped and called me by my Elvish name before I left."" He gathered the two mugs together in front of him and pulled out his healer's pouch. ""What did you do in Imladris?"" Halbarad asked softly. When Aragorn looked up at him in surprise, he threw out a hand. ""I've heard the stories, and I always wondered what it was like there."" ""I grew up - my brothers and Glorfindel taught me the sword, knives, bow, tracking and woodcraft. My Fa... foster father taught me healing. Elrond's chief counselor taught me history and literature and languages."" He pulled out a small wrapped packet and crumbled a little bit of it into one mug and then carefully tucked the packet away. ""And when I was old enough, they said, I began to ride with my brothers... my foster brothers... when they would patrol the borders of Ada's realm."" ""And you fought? That wasn't just a big story to make you sound important?"" Aragorn reached for the bundle of dried meat and hard tack. At the bottom was another small bundle of wrapped, dried leaves, and he added a careful amount to both mugs. ""I've killed orc and warg, yes,"" he replied softly. He poured boiling water into both mugs and held out Halbarad's. ""Yours isn't going to taste very good; I added willow bark to yours to help with the pain."" ""At least it's hot."" Halbarad accepted the mug and sniffed at it, wrinkling his nose but taking a cautious sip nonetheless. ""What about you?"" Aragorn put his mug down and dug in the bag for two relatively equal-sized lengths of dried meat, letting Halbarad choose his, and then handed over a helping of hard tack. ""I've seen you - you're good with a sword. Tell me about growing up Dúnedain."" Halbarad lifted the hard tack and glared at it. ""This is going to taste really awful, soaked in that swill you want me to drink."" Aragorn shrugged. ""What can I say, it's medicine and you need it. Now, about growing up..."" ""Well, I learned sword from my father, but it was my uncle who taught me tracking and woodcraft..."" oOoOo ""You two were scheduled to arrive five days ago. What do you have to say for yourselves?"" Captain Iorthon looked from one grimy, tired, worn face to the other. Aragorn and Halbarad looked at each other very quickly and then turned back to their trainer. ""It's my fault,"" Aragorn said quickly, getting his mouth open before Halbarad could say anything. ""I missed one of the markers on the trail and ended up leading us in a circle that cost us a day at least, wouldn't you say?"" He turned to his cousin. ""And it didn't help that I slipped on that patch of ice and landed on my foot,"" Halbarad nodded soberly. ""Aragorn wouldn't let me move until he had it wrapped and splinted, and a crutch found..."" Iorthon's eye narrowed. Ivoreth had been called to look over the broken ankle and declared that it had already received very adequate care; all Halbarad had to do was stay off of it for the next five weeks, and then gradually ease back into full activity. But there was something else going on here... ""You two are getting along a whole lot better than you were before too, where neither of you could speak a civil word to the other before you left. Anything you want to tell me? Anything that I'd find out about later anyway that you want to get off your chest?"" Aragorn shook his head. ""Honestly, Captain, it was an unfortunate series of mistakes that happened. They could have happened to anyone."" ""As for getting along better, we got to know each other better while we were out there,"" Halbarad announced firmly. ""We didn't have anybody else to talk to, after all. I found out I'd misjudged him..."" ""And I found out he wasn't the monster I thought he was..."" Aragorn added willingly. His gut told him that the two young men weren't telling him the whole story by a half; but by backing each other up the way they were, there was no way he'd get the truth out of either of them. Their story was too neat - too practiced - not to distrust. But the fact remained that they had weathered a serious injury and a snowstorm and still managed to limp into camp alive and relatively sound of body and spirit. Whatever happened between them, it had done some good - and proven that they had great potential as Rangers. In that respect, at least, the training exercise had been a success. ""Go on with you, then,"" he growled at Aragorn. ""There's hot food in the mess hut. I'll have a new assignment for you in a day or so. As for you,"" he turned to Halbarad, ""you're stuck here in the healer's hut for the next few weeks. Enjoy your vacation."" For some reason, the sour look on the young man's face was satisfying. He very deliberately didn't pay attention when the two young men clapped their fists together in a triumphant mutual salute and smiled very openly at each other. Halbeleg had written to tell him that the two cousins could possibly be good friends, if they could just get past the first impressions. He was pretty certain that wasn't going to be a problem anymore. FIN"

The word from those around you who care for you is that you have given up on life – that you are setting yourself up to fade, and quickly too."" ""If I fade, I will never see my father again,"" Legolas stated softly, his tone bleak. ""I don't dare."" ""In that, you are in grave error, penneth ."" Elrond shook his head. ""You do dare. Already you fade visibly to those of us who know you well."" ""My mother,"" the archer guessed with a sigh of resignation. ""Yes, although I must share in her opinions,"" Elrond admitted easily, almost relieved that Legolas could see the truth to some extent. Perhaps there was still hope to be had. Legolas sighed. ""What antidote?"" he asked again, his voice more steady than at any point in the entire exchange so far. ""You must find a way to do at least one thing you've never ever done before ere each day is finished – and you must tell someone about the experience the next day even as you search for yet another new thing to do. You must do this every day without fail."" Legolas shook his head, snorted and then returned his gaze to the far horizon. ""That's your idea of an antidote?"" ""When you're as old as I am, penneth , finding something completely new to do each and every day will seem far less of a joke than you might think,"" Elrond responded seriously. ""To continue to do so past the barrier of a week will tax any immortal's creativity. For one as young as you, the task won't seem quite so difficult at first – but it WILL become difficult very quickly, penneth, I promise you. But, if you persist, one day you'll realize that the many moments you've spent searching for and doing something new and different each day haven't been quite as empty or meaningless as you might have thought them to be – or that in the process, you may have found something else in which to find a joy and fulfillment that allows you to let go of the need to treasure each and every moment in mortal fashion."" He gazed evenly into the stunned face. ""But it will take Time and patience to accomplish that end, just as it took Time and patience for you to learn to see life in a mortal way."" Elrond pushed himself to his feet and brushed the dust of the rocky precipice from the suede leggings. ""Few Eldar would have it in them to take such a challenge and meet it, and I would not blame you for refusing to try. Whatever you decide, you should know that there will be a place for you in my halls should you want it, for however long you might want it."" He followed Legolas' gaze one last time to the far eastern horizon. ""But I tell you truthfully now, as one who has grieved, that sitting for endless hours staring at a horizon that will never grow closer will not bring your father West to you any faster – nor my sons to me. They will come when they finally choose to come, IF they finally choose to come. The friends and family we have lost to Ilúvatar's Gift will remain lost to us until the world is unmade – lost to us except in our memories, which keeps them close in a different way when we allow it. But here and now, WE have our own choices to make about our own lives."" He bowed in Legolas' direction. ""I have every confidence that you will choose well, Legolas Thranduilion."" oOoOo Legolas inclined his head and then watched as Elrond – Lord of an Imladris so like and yet unlike the one before it – walked back toward the line of trees that stood a mere hundred yards or so from the cliff's edge. Eventually the sounds of the ocean at his feet drew his eyes back to the horizon, and he gazed out thoughtfully over the broad expanse, going over all that had been said. ""Something new every day,"" he repeated to himself in a whisper. ""EVERY day?"" Even now, thinking on it, it was hard to conceive of an action he'd not done at least once before. Legolas' eyes narrowed. Certainly it couldn't be that hard, could it? His head swiveled, and he gazed at the place where Elrond had vanished into the trees. Elrond had made the challenge – was he up to meeting it? Did he even want to? Slowly, Legolas pushed himself to his feet and brushed the dust from his clothing. He gave the all too familiar eastern horizon a final glance before turning for the rapidly vanishing traces of the Elven Lord who had gone before him. Elrond was right – he WAS fading. And the antidote, while apparently so very simple, would prove to be far from easy, if his mind having yet to figure out a single new thing to do THAT day was any indication. No matter. He'd show Elrond that he could meet that challenge. He was a scion of Eryn Lasgalen – the son of the infamous Elvenking – and more than the equal to any Noldor challenge! He'd never be able to meet his father and look him in the eye if he didn't prove himself – if he continued to let himself fade. Perhaps a trip to visit Elrond's home for the first time in over three years wouldn't be such a bad idea. Surprising Elrond in his lair – now THAT would be something he'd never done! He'd still have to think of something new to do today, but it was a start. With a small smile on his lips from the memory of a light-hearted competition with Gimli a lifetime ago, Legolas stepped forward into the trees – heading home.

Ivoreth gazed out and upwards toward the holes in the cistern ceiling that were the openings of city wells, and saw that sunlight - not that muted, dim and yellow half-light that had lit the City for days before the horror, but truly bright and warm sunshine - was beaming into the cistern like spears of light that danced off of the surface of the water below. Again she shifted, this time rousing Daren and Evien. She transferred her baby sister into Evien's lap. ""Stay here,"" she whispered urgently. ""Do not move - and don't follow me."" ""Ivo!"" Daren clutched at her. ""Don't go!"" ""Shhhh!"" she soothed at him. ""Listen! I think it's all over - but I don't want to worry about you or Evi or Raini. So, Daren, I need you to be the man of the house for a little time. Can you do that?"" That had been a favorite trick Nan had used several times to get Daren to do his chores, and it was just as successful now. Daren subsided back down and put his arms around Evien. ""Don't be gone long,"" he warned her with a serious tone that sounded as much like Da's as he could manage. Ivoreth nodded. ""I'll be right back as soon as I take a quick look,"" she promised, and then carefully made her way past the others who had come into the cistern after them and now also huddled against the wall. Some of them gazed at her with eyes that were still wide with terror, others with eyes that seemed almost empty of all life. Ivoreth shuddered and moved along, down the ramp and then through the first set of bars and into the darkened drains. Two others stood just outside the final set of bars, staring out into the courtyard of the city Gate, when Ivoreth joined them. None of them spoke at first - there were no words for what they saw. The bodies of the dead were piled high, and most of the dead were the horrible, ugly, dark ones who had broken through the walls of the City. While some of them looked as if they'd been taken down by sword or club, most of them looked as if they had simply dropped where they stood, with eyes wide and terrified. Beyond the heap that lay just before the sewer drain, Ivoreth could see Gondorian soldiers and strange, yellow-haired warriors pulling bodies one by one into carts. What few street stones could be seen were stained brown or black. Did we win? she wondered. Who are those other warriors? Finally she summoned enough courage to open her mouth. ""Did we win?"" The tallest of the boys that stood with her shrugged. ""If we lost, we wouldn't be here, would we?"" That makes sense. Ivoreth looked beyond the bodies, only to discover that not a single building in First Circle had survived undamaged. The wooden structures that had nestled close to the Gate - like their own hut and many others just like it - were nothing but smoldering piles of charred and tumbled timbers. The stone-faced buildings that remained standing had all lost part or all of their fronts, and many had gaping doorways into empty space and windows that looked inwards into the building behind them. The door in the stone front of the inn where Da worked stood alone, barely supported by the remains of stone walls on either side; everything - and everyone - that had been behind that door was gone, including Da. Those who were not involved in clearing away the dead were wandering around with looks of utter shock and despair. Far too many wore clothing that was stained and filthy, and no small number wore what looked like rough and bloodstained bandaging. ""What do we do now?"" the tall boy wondered aloud to no one in particular. Good question , Ivoreth answered to herself. All she knew was that Daren and Evi and Raini were inside, waiting for her to return. And, somehow, she was going to have to take care of them. Both Da and Nan were gone now, there would be no one else. Her eye landed on the body of a woman who had fallen behind a tumble of blocks from one of the stone houses - and on the small pouch the dusty skirt not quite obscured. She pushed past the boys and tried not to look at the head of the baker, matching the attitude and shuffling of the others around her until she'd made her way over to the body. Stealing is wrong, little one, she heard her Nan's voice in her mind. But if I don't take it, someone else will, and we all will starve, she silently answered Nan's voice. Pulling her Da's little knife from her own pocket, she bent swiftly and cut the pouch strings, then pulled both pouch and knife back into her own pocket in a single, smooth move. She glanced over at the boys and was grateful that they were still busy watching the soldiers. Ivoreth shuddered, realizing that her life from now on was going to be very different. She tried not to explore the pouch she'd taken, but knew from the feel of it in her hand that it held more coin than Da had seen in most of her life. I'm a thief now, she told herself sadly. Nan will never forgive me, and Da… She shuddered, deciding not to even consider what her Da would say or do to her had he known what she'd just done. I have no choice. Da told me to take care of them, and this is all I know how to do. But we will survive. I swear to you, Da, Nan, we will survive! Somehow. FIN"

""With gratitude, we accept once more the crown of Eryn Lasgalen, and we thank all of those who kept her safely for us in our absence."" Only once before had she been so nearly bowled over by the sound of one person's voice. She could feel the heaviness in her chest swell slightly, but she ignored it in her joy to know that her Lord was safe, and well, and standing right in front of her once more. Elara turned to her left and felt Baradion press the tall welcome cup into her hands. Again she faced forward again. ""Please accept this cup, and the welcome of your people, Aran Thranduil Oropherion,"" she intoned, again extending her hands. Thranduil took the cup from her, again with his fingers gently brushing hers. But instead of returning the cup to her, as she had been told was the custom, he turned around. "" Aran Borendor, it was an extreme honor and privilege to stand and fight beside you in ridding our mountains and woods of the last of the Enemy's minions. Please accept this cup and know that the welcome of Eryn Lasgalen that it represents shall be yours until the breaking of the world."" ""We honor the friendship, kinship and alliance with our Silvan brothers,"" an even deeper and slightly accented voice stated very formally. ""It is with pleasure we drink of your welcome and accept the offer of the hospitality of your hall. May the Powers ever bless your house and your realm, Aran Thranduil Oropherion."" ""Let the news now be spread across the land. The Enemy resides no more in the Hithaeglir. Our roads are safe from all who held allegiance to the Dark Lord or his captains. And to all of those who fought bravely to accomplish this and have come home whole to a man, let there be great praise!"" Thranduil announced grandly. Immediately, everyone who had crowded to the front of the Hall to see and hear gave a shout that echoed through the mountain. Thranduil cleared his voice, and the tumult ceased. ""Therefore, let those who have families to greet them find rest and reunion with loved ones. Rooms are being prepared for our honored guests, are they not?"" Elara blinked to find herself addressed directly, and it took a moment to move through the sense of dizziness. ""Sire, they are being prepared as we speak."" ""Warriors of Eryn Lasgalen, of Eryn Dínen, you are dismissed!"" There was a collective cheer from both the warriors and the families that now spilled out of the great door in search of their loved ones, and Thranduil captured Elara's hand and pulled her safely out of the way and into his side. Elara knew better than to lean into him yet, no matter how much she both wanted and needed to. Tarion had been most specific as to what was expected of her - and of the King. Thranduil would have many duties that had to be seen to once he arrived, and she would be in charge of seeing to it that all necessary arrangements were made for the feast that evening; so the time for her to greet him privately would not come for many hours. ""Borendor, may I present Elariel Bardhoniel, Lady of Eryn Lasgalen. Elara, this is Aran Borendor of Eryn Dhínen, the Silent Wood of the Avarrim ."" ""Sire, it is an honor."" Elara dropped into as graceful curtsey as she could manage. Hearing her full, formal name reminded her yet again of the very official nature of that introduction. ""So this is the fireth that has you so tied in knots, my friend,"" the deep voice chuckled, and then a hand on hers lifted Elara to stand erect again. ""It is my great pleasure to make your acquaintance, Lady."" ""Sire?"" She had tied Thranduil in knots? What was he talking about? Had she done something wrong after all? ""Peace, child, you have done your Lord no harm,"" the very deep voice soothed at her with a note of amusement. ""I have had very little contact with your people, so you must excuse me if my humor does not strike properly."" Elara felt Thranduil's arm surround her shoulder. ""Allow us to show you to a suitable apartment, where you may refresh yourself and rest for a time before our feast. Come, Elara. Did you by any chance have any of the suites in the royal wing prepared as well?"" ""Yes, Sire,"" she answered quietly, thoroughly intimidated to be in such lofty company. Thranduil had long since stopped being a King for her except in title under normal circumstances - but now, she felt very much at a disadvantage. She was only a wood-gatherer's daughter and wife; how she had ended up in the position of the Lady of the Elvenking's Hall still astounded her. And now, walking between two Elven Kings of unimaginable antiquity, she felt the full weight of her position and, for the first time in years, felt completely out of place performing the duties that had fallen to her. ""I knew I could depend on you,"" Thranduil said softly, bending down to put his lips close to her ear. ""You have lost weight again. I will hear of this soon."" Elara nodded. She wasn't surprised he'd noticed. She could only hope he'd understand the distress that had cost her appetite.

You have seen the repairs being done to the bridge? Minas Tirith will never be far from Ithilien; and you know how close Estel has been with Legolas all this time."" Her father was silent for a long time, and his arm had tightened around her just a little bit more, telling her that his thoughts were again difficult ones. ""My only regret, other than that of not having you with me in Aman, is that I will not know your children,"" he finally admitted in a whisper. Arwen's eyes filled. ""And they will know you only from the stories Estel and I - and Elladan and Elrohir - tell them."" Elrond took another long, cleansing breath, his usual practice when struggling to bring his emotions back into control. ""And perhaps that is as it should be. The time for the First-born to fade from the world has come. You remain to give new infusion of our grace to Men, while I fade into the mists of time. The manner of immortality that you have chosen is different than mine, but it is no less real, Arwen. It is just…"" He kissed her again. ""For Three Ages of the World, Elves and Men have walked the road together; sometimes as allies, sometimes as strangers. We have done our best to help Men reach their potential, but the time for mentoring is over. We have now arrived at the fork in the road, placed here by the One so that Men will have to make their own way from now on. And our roads fork here as well, daughter, at the same place."" Arwen smiled. Ever had her father been able to wax philosophical; it came with being the foremost Lore-master this side of the Sea. He was saying nothing that wasn't true, but turning facts into means to understand and offer comfort. Her love for her father - for both of her parents, without whose wisdom and guidance she would have to live the rest of her life - swelled inside her until she could think of no good response, no good tangent to take their discussion. And so she slipped her arm over her father's chest and held on tightly, her head pressed against the silk of his hair over his shoulder, and closed her eyes to carve the moment into her memory to take with her through the long separation to come. oOoOo The Elven flags waved briskly in the breeze as the delegation from Imladris rode through the gate of Edoras and turned northward toward Lothlórien. At the head of the company rode Elrond alone. His back was straight, his gaze fixed studiously on the road ahead of him. He dared not look back. He already knew what he'd see: Arwen would be on the wide veranda of Meduseld, watching her past life ride away from her. Her hand would be raised in a farewell wave, even though they had discussed this the day before, just before they had ridden back toward Edoras. She knew he would not see the wave. But he knew, with the same conviction that he knew his own heart, that she stood and offered her farewell wave nonetheless. ""When I ride out tomorrow, my daughter, I will not turn back to you. I cannot. If I turn, I will not be able to leave; and you and your brothers and Estel will be forced to watch me fade. I cannot remain here any longer."" ""I understand, Ada."" She understood, but he knew even then that she would still hope for one last look, one last wave from him. ""And this evening, I will not join the host for the farewell feast. I will not see either you or Estel, lest I be tempted to remain."" ""Then this really is farewell? Right now??"" Oh, how tiny, how frightened his daughter's voice had been. ""Yes. The time for our farewell is come."" ""Ada…"" ""I will tell your mother that when last I saw you, you were High Queen of Gondor, happily married to a man who fills the corners of your soul in a way no other would. She will rejoice to know that you have found love and will know the blessing of children."" ""Ada…"" ""Come now. We must ride back to Edoras before Éomer King and your husband send out a search party for us."" ""Ada!"" She had thrown herself at him then, crying bitter tears. ""I love you, and I will miss you more than you will ever know!"" ""And I you, my daughter, the brightest star in my evening sky, outshining the moon and even Eärendil's gem."" And he had wept as he embraced her, holding her tighter than ever, battling the grief that he would never hold her again. ""May the stars ever shine brightly on you and yours, and the One hold you in the palm of his hand. Know that even from Aman, your mother and I watch over you in our hearts with pride and love."" All the words had been said. All the embraces had been given. His farewell to Estel had been much more brief, but no less poignant or difficult. All that was left him now was to get past that first turn in the road, the one that put out of sight Meduseld and the rise upon which the city of Edoras was built. Tears streaming down his cheeks, Elrond lifted his face and set his eyes on the northern horizon. He wouldn't look back past the fork in the road that led him away from his beloved Evenstar. His Undómiel. It would wound her desperately, but he would not turn. He couldn't. He didn't dare. FIN"

The look on his face and the things he was doing with his hands told me he meant you no good. And once I had chased him away, I was not about to leave you to drown by inches in a chilled stream until you awoke again by yourself, if you ever did, or to catch lung fever from wearing clothing that was soaked through to the skin to the point it would not keep you warm."" She was unnerved by the display of indignation, as well as the idea that he had helped her for no other reason than that she needed assistance, and she looked away so that she didn't continue to be pinned by the intensity of his gaze. ""It's just…"" She sighed. ""It's just been a long time since anybody's really helped me. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make you mad."" He sighed deeply and seemed to calm down a bit. ""I am not angry at you, little one, merely very weary of a world which has grown so cold-hearted that a helping hand from a stranger can be so deeply mistrusted."" He rose, taking the stool with him and putting it back in its place at the table. ""As for your not having a home…"" He gestured around the room. ""This is not much, but it is warm and dry and safe. Until you have the coin to return to your proper place, wherever that is, you may consider it yours."" Marisol stared at him. ""But… You don't even know me. I could be…"" She shuddered, thinking of all the things that she had done to survive in the past months that she would never have considered herself capable of, things she was ashamed of. ""I could be a thief…"" ""Yes, I realize that."" Strangely, her protestations didn't seem to alarm him. ""And if I find out that your means of acquiring coin runs to the dishonest, it will cost you this place and my protection. I will not allow you to bring trouble to my doorstep."" His protection? That was right – somewhere out there in the dark and the rain was a certifiable nutcase hell-bent on assaulting her. ""But Crazy Larry won't stop, and I know he'll come looking for me. You don't want me to cause you any trouble, and Crazy Larry is nothing but trouble."" Not after he had taken care of her, saved her from almost certain attack… His eyebrow were quite expressive when they shot upwards in that manner. ""Crazy Larry?"" ""That's what they called him at the shelter, and the folks who sleep under the overpass said…"" ""Is that where you have been staying?"" It seemed impossible, but the eyebrows had risen even higher. ""It wasn't so bad until the weather turned, the underpass, I mean,"" she answered, cringing at his tone. ""At least it was dry. When it got cold, I stayed at the shelter a few nights…"" ""But the shelter, if memory serves, is a quite unsavory place; and the underpass is even more so, and cold besides."" ""I had no choice."" It was the truth, and an unhappy one. ""Without a home, nobody would hire me, and without a job, I couldn't pay for a motel room."" Mac gazed at her intently for a long and silent moment, and Marisol tried very hard to ignore the thoughts she was certain were running through his mind. Finally, however, he turned away and crouched down next to the hearth to tend the pot again. ""No matter. Provided you behave appropriately, you need go back to neither place again."" He was a strange one, Marisol decided as she relaxed back against the rough cloth beneath her, clinging to the blankets over her as if they could shield her from everything that had gone wrong with her life of late. His moods seemed to blow hot and cold very easily, and he moved with an almost wild feline grace that spoke of great strength. She had felt that strength when he'd lifted her so she could drink his tea, and the thought of it turned against her was frightening. But he had yet to touch her with anything but respect and gentleness, and he had offered her a place of her own next to a hearth that warmed the inside of this one-room shelter better than the floor furnace had heated the women's dormitory in the shelter. He had fed her bread that hadn't seemed stale or moldy, and the smells beginning to arise from that pot he kept stirring were starting to make her stomach growl softly. ""Thank you,"" she said softly, not wanting to rile him at all and finally finding a reason to remember her manners. He rose and walked over to a wooden box that she hadn't noticed before, situated below the shelves, opened a hinged top and drew out something. ""Here,"" he said, turning and tossing that nameless something onto the bed. ""It is too large for you, I am sure, but perhaps you will feel a little less vulnerable or threatened if you are wearing more than just a blanket or two."" It was soft leather, softer than any she'd ever seen before, and by the cut it was a shirt. She pulled it beneath her blanket and dragged it over her head. He was right; she swam in it. But as he had suspected, she felt a little more secure. Maybe all of her nightmares weren't on the verge of coming true after all. ""Thank you,"" she said again, a little more confidently this time. ""What is your name?"" he asked, turning to close the box again. ""Marisol."" She saw him nod slowly. ""A pretty name."""
371,2,16,2-Aearwen22-16.txt,lord-of-the-rings,Aearwen22,"and seated himself in the other chair, then slipped an eating dagger from somewhere on his person and cut the meat on her plate into smaller pieces. She stared at him when he gestured, obviously telling her to eat, and then set about feeding himself. But the meat smelled so good, and it had been so long since she'd had any food that tasted anything but sickening, Inzilanî cautiously took up a piece of meat and slipped it into her mouth. The taste was so wonderful that she couldn't help the tears that overflowed onto her cheeks. If she was to die soon, at least these nimîr were giving her a fine last meal. She was so overwhelmed that it was hard to remember that she had to chew and then swallow. For the first time, she began to wonder if all the stories told of the nimîr and their ways had been mistaken. Certainly the gown she now wore, and the food waiting for her on the plate, indicated that perhaps they knew mercy and extended it, at least once in a while. She still flinched when her keeper arose suddenly and walked past her to where a pitcher sat on a crate with several metal cups nearby. He poured the liquid into two of the cups and brought them back to the table, setting one in front of her before returning to his seat. He nodded at her as he took a sip. A little braver this time, Inzilanî picked up the cup and sniffed. Water! Fresh, clear, sweet water! Never had something so simple tasted so good! She sipped at the water, holding the cup in both hands in case it would be taken from her. More than food, she had missed the taste of water. The draughts that the uruk continually drank had been nauseating and not at all thirst-quenching. She looked up to see the nimir watching her closely with those strange, glowing grey eyes of his, totally lacking in animosity or disgust. Taking a chance, she reached out and pinched another bit of meat and sat back in her chair, as far away from him as she could get, and chewed it slowly, still cradling her cup of water in the other hand. He used his bread to wipe up the juices from the meat and then sat back himself, munching on the nuts and berries. When her keeper didn't move a muscle after finishing his meal except to keep a close eye on her, Inzilanî cautiously pulled the plate into her lap, where she could pop the bits of meat into her mouth with little effort. Suddenly famished, she made short work of the meat, followed her keeper's example to sop up the juices with the bread, and then put the plate back on the table, full and suddenly quite sleepy. She jerked awake when her keeper rose and came next to her. Her cup was drained of its water, so she didn't fight him when he took the cup and set it back on the table, but her eyes went wide when he took hold of an arm and gently pulled on it, urging her to rise again. So the time had come at last, although she had been given a good meal to convince her to cooperate. It was better than the uruk had ever done, and so even though she was shaking like a leaf in the wind, she allowed him to pull her back towards the big bed. The gown was only so she could be decent while eating? Inzilanî began to pull the gown back over her head, only to have her keeper's hands tug the gown back down again with another strangled, "" Baw! "" Did that mean ""no?"" Instead, he pulled back the top covers on the bed and gestured for her to climb in. It made no difference to her whether she was used on top of the blankets or beneath them. And maybe the Great One enjoyed destroying clothing. Either way, she wouldn't fight him. He'd seen her fed, no doubt by his order, given her water to drink and clothing to wear for however little time. She wouldn't fight. Perhaps, then, he'd decide to keep her – and if he didn't hurt her too badly very often, she would think herself lucky. Inzilanî did as she was bid, and could hardly believe how warm and comfortable the bed was once her keeper had pulled the covers over her. There was a soft padding that cradled her head just right. She yawned despite herself, but forced herself to keep watch on the tent flap for when the Great One would appear. But her keeper was now moving about the tent, extinguishing candles until only one lonely flame at the table illumined the tent's interior. Her eyes widened in sudden understanding. Perhaps it wasn't the Great One who would be possessing her tonight, but rather this nimir warrior instead? She grew more confused, however, when her keeper simply sought the chair he had taken while eating and stretched out his long legs to cross them at the ankles. This didn't make any sense! She was spoils of war – she knew her fate! Why were they toying with her? Maybe they wanted nothing to do with one who had been possessed and used by the urik ? Maybe she disgusted them, and they only waited for the light of day to put her out of her misery. They'd given her a last meal, to send her soul on its way to her ancestors without the curse of hunger. Oh, but she was tired, and the light was dim enough that it was hard to hold her eyes open… Vocabulary - (s) Sindarin (a) Adúnaic baw - (s) no, don't nimir - (s) Elf nimîr - (s) Elves urik - (a) orcs (obj. case) urkan - (a) orc (nom. case) uruk - (a) orc (obj. case)"

""He always has,"" came the tired rejoinder. ""So, will you help me, Master Gimli?"" The dwarf lifted his mug and took a long and noisy draught, all the while gazing pointedly at the Elvenking. Thranduil could feel the caution in that gaze seeking to uncover any agendas within the request, and let his mind and gaze remain as open and accessible as possible. For once, this was not a contest. ""It is not a pretty tale,"" Gimli offered finally. ""Where would you want me to start?"" ""At the beginning."" Thranduil sighed in relief. ""I sent my son to express our regrets at having lost the creature Gollum; and the next thing I knew, his lieutenant was returning alone with word from Master Elrond that he had joined in a desperate Fellowship to destroy the One Ring."" Gimli eyed the half-empty carafe of wine. ""We'll need more of that, and food besides, before we're done. 'Tis a long and complicated tale."" Thranduil smiled, for the first time finding the dwarf's sensibilities and personality genuinely amusing rather than grating. ""Have no fear; there is plenty of both to be had, if required."" He settled back in his chair, his goblet held casually against his chest as he waited. ""Very well then."" The dwarf pulled his mug to him and settled back against suede cushions, his eyes growing distant with recall. ""Elrond's council was held on a broad porch, and as I remember it, the morning was warm..."" oOoOo Elf and dwarf stood side by side as the great gate of the Elvenking's Hall ground open and let in the light of a new day. There was no animosity, no reticence between them; the discomfort each had once felt in the company of the other had fallen away like so much chaff in the wind, leaving the germ of genuine mutual respect behind. Already, Thranduil's stablemaster held Gimli's pony ready for him; and a bulging bag hanging from one side of the saddle spoke of the more than ample provisions that would make meals less than monotonous affairs of lembas or dried fruit. The little mount's headstall sparkled in the dappled morning sun as it tossed its head, eager to be on the road. Thranduil turned suddenly and faced the dwarf, not entirely ready to farewell him yet; for each moment the dwarf spent here, in Eryn Lasgalen, was another moment that he could be certain his son spent still in Ennor. At last, however, he thrust out his hand abruptly. ""Thank you for coming such a long way at my request, and may the stars ever shine upon your path both here in Arda and, when the time comes, beyond the circles of the world. I pray the Belain grant you entry."" Gimli tipped his head back and gave him a long and thoughtful look before grasping the Elvenking's forearm in a warrior's hold. ""Rarely have I enjoyed such fine, elven hospitality outside of Ithilien or Imladris. May the stars ever shine upon your path as well, King Thranduil."" ""I will remember you,"" the Elvenking said softly, in a tone meant for none but Gimli. ""My son was right to call you a heart-brother and elvellon, and I am grateful that you are set to once more watch his back as he takes this final journey. Just remember, you take my heart with you into the West. I am trusting you to guard it well."" ""You have my word,"" Gimli swore in a similar tone. ""I can do nothing less."" Two seasoned Greenwood warriors mounted their steeds as Gimli stepped up on the block and clambered awkwardly into the saddle. Their presence had been the subject of the one last, good-spirited debate between the two of them. Gimli had traveled the length of the Old Forest Road into Eryn Lasgalen in the company of traders and was certain he could join up with a similar group going the other direction; Thranduil refused to let his welfare be left to chance, and had assigned two of his best to accompany the dwarf all the way to his destination - be that Aglarond or Ithilien - before returning. With raised hands in farewell, the trio turned their horses' heads to the south and the path that would bring them to the Old Forest Road. Thranduil watched until all three figures had turned the corner and disappeared behind the thick forest, and then looked out through the trees before stepping through the doorway and heading into the comfortable shade of oak and elm. It was a quiet day - a good day to have bid farewell to a fine and noble friend. He should have known. Legolas' ability to read the quality of others had been uncanny for centuries; he should not have argued when his son had so rebelliously named Gimli elvellon so long ago. He was proving the truth of that even now, by being determined to watch over Legolas on a journey that Thranduil himself would probably never make. So much time had been wasted holding at arm's length one who deserved to be treated as friend! He should have done this long ago. FIN"
373,2,11,2-Aearwen22-11.txt,lord-of-the-rings,Aearwen22,"Aglarond…' Where is this Aglarond?"" He frowned at the nod from the Dwarf that indicated that he knew where it was. ""Well?"" he demanded. ""Aglarond is the name of Gimli's colony in the mountains near Helm's Deep. That's in Rohan,"" Glóin sighed. He reached into his vest and pulled out a fold of parchment and opened it. ""He says here, 'We both think that you two would benefit from traveling together, since you both will be going to the same places. You can keep each other company on the road, and perhaps get to know each other better.' See?"" Glóin tapped the letter with a frustrated forefinger and then tossed it onto the desk, where Thranduil caught it up immediately. ""I told you: not my idea."" Gimli's handwriting was even worse than Legolas', but then, Thranduil was far less acquainted with the Dwarven script than with the cirth or tengwar that was used in Sindarin. ""Nor my idea of a good idea either,"" he replied, tossing the letter back to the desk. ""Even if it were, Gimli told me that your kind does not favor riding, and I certainly have no intention on walking the hundreds of leagues between here and Osgiliath!"" ""We don't tend to favor riding temperamental creatures three times taller than ourselves, no,"" was the arched reply. ""But I wouldn't object to a pony…"" ""A pony?"" Thranduil's brows nearly touched the woven circlet of leaves and flowers. ""You do want to get there in time for the ceremonies, do you not?"" Glóin's brows could fold into a frown that was downright frightening. ""Are you saying that a pony would not get me there in time?"" ""I am saying that I will be riding my stallion, and it will be difficult for any pony to keep up with him."" Thranduil sat back in his chair and crossed his arms over his chest. ""If you travel with me, you will have to have a more proper mount."" ""I'll fall and break my neck!"" ""Nonsense! Gimli spent a goodly portion of that wretched Quest behind Legolas on his Arod, who is no less tall than my Aduial. To my knowledge, he did not fall or break his neck."" ""Yes, and Gimli told me that if he never had to sit on the backside of a horse again, it would be too soon!"" Glóin thumped the mug down on the desk and crossed his arms over his chest in a mirror of Thranduil. ""If you think I'd agree to hanging onto your belt so that I don't tumble to my death…"" Thranduil blinked. ""I did not mean that you would ride behind me !"" He huffed and frowned. ""Certainly one of the benefits of being royalty is being able to ride one's own steed in peace."" ""Well, I certainly wouldn't manage by myself on one of those monsters, now, would I?"" Glóin retorted, ""And although he hates the jostling, Gimli had to admit that they traveled faster when he rode with Legolas, who, as your son, is also royalty, is he not?"" ""That was different,"" Thranduil fumed. ""They were…"" ""Did they not arrive at your Hall together on the back of that beast? I know they arrived at my Hall that way…"" ""I am not going to force Aduial to ride double!"" Glóin glowered at him. ""Is he so delicate an animal then?"" ""He is a highly trained war-stallion. He is most definitely not delicate!"" ""Then what's the problem? He can bear the both of us…"" Thranduil stared at the Dwarf and then buried his face in his hand. ""This is never going to work. Somewhere along the road to Osgiliath, we are certain to kill each other."" ""I know. I have no idea what they were thinking,"" Glóin commiserated. ""What are we going to do?"" Thranduil leaned his chin into his hand and contemplated his guest. ""They will expect us to take their suggestion."" Glóin shrugged. ""How soon were you planning to leave?"" Long fingers picked lazily through the papers and brought up three drooping sheets. ""I am still in the middle of leaving adequate instructions for my aides to follow in my absence. It will take another day, perhaps more, before I can consider leaving. And once this tome I write now is done, I will have to fight my advisors who, because they are unhappy with my leaving in the first place, will no doubt insist on my taking a squad of warriors at the very least, for my protection…"" His hand fell limp to the desk, bearing the papers with it. ""You can't travel quickly with a military company!"" Thranduil nodded. ""Did you not hear me say that I would be fighting them? Like our sons' suggestion, it is not my idea."" Glóin's eyes narrowed. ""Another day or so at least before you can leave, eh?"" He rubbed his forefinger beneath his nose, stroking the moustache and then sat up straighter. His eyes glinted in restrained mischief. ""How much would getting away without an escort be worth to you?"" ""Why? What did you have in mind?"" Thranduil sat up straighter himself, suddenly wary. Dwarves making deals was never a situation that inspired trust. ""If I can figure out how to get you out of here without an escort and accompanying nobles, you will put me on the back of that… mule of yours so that we can make good time,"" Glóin stated firmly, defending it with, ""It's a fair compromise."" ""We shall still end up wishing each other dead by the time we pass the southern fences of Eryn Lasgalen,"" Thranduil warned. Glóin shrugged. ""So? What else will be new?"" He smiled at the Elvenking. ""Are you game?"" ""I can already tell I am going to regret this,"" Thranduil grumbled, ""but yes. If you can get us out of here without a full escort, I can… Aduial can carry us both."" ""Good!"" The Dwarf had the audacity to look pleased. ""Then this is what we shall do…"""

""And I am proud to claim you as friend and ally once more. May the stars watch over you and yours."" ""And may they ever watch over you and yours as well, 'Fin,"" Ecthelion squeezed Glorfindel's shoulder one last time. ""Take good care of him,"" he then aimed in Erestor's direction with a sharp glaze. ""I shall,"" was the reply, coupled with another bow. Apparently satisfied, Ecthelion turned and soon had vanished into the shadows that lined the street. ""Give me those,"" Erestor demanded, immediately relieving Glorfindel of his bundles and handed them off to Sedilwen. ""Can you see to it that these…"" ""I shall make certain that a room remains that he can claim as his,"" Sedilwen said and hefted the bundles closer. ""Come to me when this lot has worn you out entirely, my lord, and I shall guide you."" She bustled off toward the innkeeper's counter. ""Now…"" Erestor put a warm hand at Glorfindel's back. ""I believe that there are a few people who were more than a little disappointed when you vanished so quickly."" Glorfindel shuddered beneath what was meant as a comforting gesture. ""I should apologize…"" ""You should not worry, old friend,"" Erestor leaned into his ear. ""I told you I would explain your departure. For now, you need say nothing more than that you have decided that this was the better place to be."" When Glorfindel pulled back and stared, Erestor merely nodded. ""Consider it a welcoming gift."" ""I think I am very lucky in my friends,"" Glorfindel managed finally around the surge of emotion that threatened to choke him. ""You have no idea…"" Erestor shook his head. ""No more of that; this is not the time for long faces and regrets. Come on, now. The festivities await…"" That warm hand between Glorfindel's shoulder blades became an insistent push toward the open door of the inn and the dark-haired man standing just within, who turned at the sensation of motion behind him. ""Elrond…"" Glorfindel could manage very little else before Elrond pulled him forward into a tight and welcoming embrace and pounded his back in a distinctly Peredhil manner. ""It is about time you arrived!"" His lord loosened his hold and stepped back to take in his face, his own face falling into concern at what he evidently saw. ""Glorfindel? Is all well with you?"" Glorfindel looked around the room. Lindir was indeed holding forth on his harp, leading a group of musicians in the kind of music that couldn't help but make the toe wish to tap. Glorfindel smiled in memory, for it was a tune that a mortal child of Minas Tirith had taught them all years ago. In a corner, Elladan and Celebriel stood arm in arm, watching the dancers and speaking softly, while Elrohir had taken his place with the musicians and a borrowed harp. Not far away, Celeborn and Galadriel stood wrapped in each other's arms, slowly swaying to the music and paying attention to nobody other than themselves. Now close enough to see his lord clearly, he could tell that Elrond himself seemed to have dropped the weight of centuries and bore a countenance of peace and contentment so contrary to what he had sported in Ennor that the change strained at Glorfindel's credulity. Last but certainly not least, coming toward him with her face alight in a way he had not seen aimed in his direction in well over four ennin , was Celebrían. For the first time in their long acquaintance, however, he refused to allow himself to see the resemblance to Lírinyellë in her, determined that from now on, he would only see Celebrían for herself. At last he looked into Elrond's eyes. ""I am well,"" he said, and felt his faer swell with contentment. For a brief moment he wondered guiltily whether he should have felt this way in the company of his sons and daughter instead, but dismissed the thought immediately after it arose. He was well – or at least better – now. ""I am home now, among family. How could I not be well?"" After another questioning glance, Elrond nodded as if the answer were satisfactory, at least for the time being. ""Good. Have you eaten?"" ""Only a little…"" And that little bit sat like a hard, cold lump at the bottom of his stomach. ""I shall leave you in the hands of my lady-wife, then. Erestor, would you find our prodigal Battle Master a nice, tall goblet of wine while I see to it that he gets some of Aurin's…"" Elrond dragged Erestor off into the crowd. ""It is about time you got here,"" Celebrían told him with eyes that shimmered with health and life. Without further ado, she threw her arms around Glorfindel's neck and hugged him tightly. ""I wanted to thank you for taking such good care of all of them for me. And then you were gone…"" Glorfindel sighed. ""My apologies, Lady. I did not mean to upset you…"" ""Hush! Elrond is gathering a plate for you, and you will sit at our table. No arguments, now…"" Celebrían's embrace transformed itself into a hand snaking around his upper arm to hold him close and guide him through the throng in the inn's common room. ""Now that you are finally here, our family is as complete as it can be."" ""I am glad to be home,"" he said fervently, knowing that, at last, he had come home. Perhaps not exactly the home he'd hoped for, but it was home. Here, with these people, he had a family, a place and a purpose sufficient to sustain him into a future that was his to shape. He shook off his melancholy, took a deep breath, and then allowed his relief and joy at being with those he truly cared about blossom into a huge grin. ""And I am starving …"""

The thought that, perhaps, at least her son could be happy here brought a small smile to her lips. She then returned to in front of the hearth and perched herself on the edge of her seat, concerned at the strange outpouring of emotion from her host that, on observation, didn't seem to be abating as yet. ""Is everything all right with you, my Lord?"" She didn't dare reach out to him, although she suspected he was as much in need of comfort as she ever had been since her nightmare began. ""I'm sorry,"" he began, shaking his head slightly. ""I just hadn't expected…"" Elrond visibly and with some difficulty worked to reclaim his composure, wiping away the tears with an unapologetic hand and then taking another healthy sip of the wine. ""My apologies, Lady. I'm not normally so easily provoked to strong emotions this early in the day."" ""What was it?"" Gilraen just had to know. ""I heard my sons laughing,"" Elrond stated simply in a voice in which the deep emotions still stirred vigorously. Gilraen blinked, still not understanding how such a simple thing would inspire such a strong response, and he sighed deeply before continuing. ""Many, many years ago, my wife…"" His voice caught, and she found herself holding her breath. ""My wife was captured by orcs and tortured."" Gilraen closed her eyes and felt her heart squeeze painfully. He hadn't said ""killed,"" he'd said ""captured and tortured."" How much worse must that have been! At least Arathorn's death, although shocking and altogether too soon, had been swift – he hadn't suffered. Elrond continued on, his voice bleak. ""My sons found her and brought her home to me. It was a miracle she'd survived at all; but as it turned out, I could only heal her body. Her fae , her spirit, had been too badly broken by what she'd endured before she was rescued. She couldn't remain in Middle-earth, and she took ship. My sons blamed themselves – and me, I suppose – for their Naneth's injuries and need to depart; and they became very angry. For centuries now, they have exorcised their fury on the Enemy's minions, hunting them relentlessly and spending almost all their time in battle."" He gazed in the direction of the garden and the sounds of gentle conversation and yet more laughter. ""I've seldom seen them in the time since then; and always, when they came home, were they somber and lifeless. Often, they were badly injured, and rarely would they share the details of what had happened to them as I repaired their bodies only to know they'd leave again as soon as they were healed enough to travel. I've often wondered, as they would ride away yet again from here to continue their personal war of revenge, if I would ever see them again on this side of the Sundering Sea. When I first saw them last night, they were cold and wet and tired and heart-sick at what had happened to their friend and comrade, and concerned when you collapsed almost the moment of their arrival. To see them today, suddenly, healthy and whole in my garden, laughing and taking pleasure in the company of a small child is as if the last five hundred years had been an evil dream."" Long fingers wiped away more tears before they could fall this time. ""It's like seeing the warm sun of Spring after a very long and fell winter."" Gilraen stared. He knew . He'd lost too, and lost dearly. The need to sacrifice in the name of duty was something that Elrond knew all too well. For the first time since she'd been introduced to the tall, elven warriors who had become her husband's battle advisors and comrades-in-arms, she began to appreciate what had driven them to the lengths they had taken. She'd seen several of the younger men of her village end up on a similar path over the few years she'd spent hearing of such things. ""This is why I shall call your son Estel, for he has brought the hope of healing back into my house,"" Elrond continued in a thoughtful tone. ""He is the hope of your people too, so the name fits on a number of levels."" The Elf Lord took a long and stabilizing breath before turning a rapidly calming gaze on her. ""Does my choice meet with your approval?"" ""Yes,"" she answered quietly, knowing now that the choice of epessë held meaning for the both of them. That he was asking her permission to assign that name before making it official made her feel better, as if she were having some say in what would happen after believing herself completely powerless. His rapidly clearing gaze told her he was quickly reclaiming his calm and serenity, but she gazed at him with open concern. ""Will you be all right, my Lord?"" ""I think, perhaps…"" He rose and extended his hand to her. ""…that unless there is something else you feel we need to discuss immediately, I would like to spend some time in my garden with my sons – and with your son, if you don't mind. Would you like to join me?"" ""I would be honored,"" she answered and allowed him to pull her to her feet again and tuck her hand into the bend in his elbow. Elrohir had been right. This interview, while difficult, hadn't been half as bad as she'd feared. Elrond himself was far less intimidating than she'd expected. She could deal with this kind-hearted soul who gracefully pulled the door to his study open and allowed her to take the lead for the moment. And Imladris, for all its other-worldly nature, was suddenly not such a bad place to be. Perhaps she, too, could at least be happy here.

""Grandfather!"" she called out in alarm, reaching for him instinctively. ""Farewell, little daughter. Remember, you are not alone."" His words faded until they sounded very far away. oOoOo ""Do we have a visitor?"" Celebrían's voice carried from his office door. Elrond studied the chair next to him, which now sat empty. ""Not any longer,"" he said sadly. ""But, for a short time, I did indeed have a most extraordinary visitor."" He looked up at her as she crossed the room to stand beside him. ""I have met and spoken with our many, many times over great-great granddaughter, who even now is awaking in her bed in Ennor."" Celebrían's eyes opened wide. ""In Ennor?"" she repeated. He nodded. ""And it is not the first time we have met."" He rose and took his wife's hand. ""Do you remember my telling you, back when Urovor was just born, that I had dreamed I was in Imladris again – only it was in ruins?"" ""And you said you saw that young man that looked like your Estel?"" ""Exactly! But before I saw him, there was this child – dark curls just like Estel's – and I showed her where we kept the garden tools in the foot of the statue, remember? Only I had taken the tools out and put some toys in there for Estel when he was tiny: a carved horse and six men and a ball to knock them over with."" Elrond smiled at the memory. ""She is all grown up now, a very lovely young lady."" ""She saw you, in Imladris?"" Celebrían's shock only grew at his nod. ""And now, she came… here …"" ""She dreamed herself here. Her father, the one who looked so much like Estel and Arwen, has just stepped past the circles of the world, and she was feeling very alone."" He tugged gently on his wife's hand and pulled her into his arms. ""I have no idea how or why, but I think Eru – or perhaps one of the Belain – decided to let our faer touch again so that I could show her that she was not entirely alone. The strange thing is, we understood each other, even though each of us was speaking in our own language."" Celebrían sighed and leaned into him. ""I almost wish I had come sooner. I would like to have seen this distant daughter."" ""I wish you had too,"" he murmured and buried his nose in her hair. ""I wish you had too."" oOoOo ""Em?"" ""Out here."" She tipped her head and studied the portrait in front of her. Yes, that looked right. It was good to know her artistic skills were still in good working order. Randy crossed the back yard to where she had her easel set up and gave her cheek a peck, then stopped and stared at the canvas. ""Nice painting. Who is it?"" Emma smiled. ""Someone I've met a couple of times."" ""Looks familiar,"" he said, narrowing his eyes. ""I've seen that face before."" She didn't respond, but touched her brush to the palette and added a slight gleam to the gold of the bead that held that wonderful, intricate braid. ""Did you see the realtor?"" Emma smiled to herself. That, of course, was Randy's real reason for coming by – besides picking her up for dinner out with his wife and daughters, as they'd arranged earlier in the day. ""Yes. The signs go up tomorrow. Once my place sells, I'll give you your full share of the price of Mom and Dad's house. That was our agreement."" Randy shook his head and then rubbed his beard. ""I still think you're being unreasonable. This house is far too big for you by yourself."" ""I know."" The brush touched the other gold bead, and it began to gleam too. ""But I feel most at home here . That condominium was nice…"" ""Nice!"" Randy gaped. ""You bought that place for a steal when prices were low, and you're going to be making beaucoup bucks on it, even in this poor economy!"" Leave it to him to miss the sentiment and only pay attention to the dollar signs. ""Yeah. But this is my home."" She gazed about the back yard, and wondered about maybe putting in some flowers – and maybe a bench near the old elm tree. It wouldn't take much effort to make it resemble just a little bit more another, distant, garden. ""As long as everything works out, all I can say is that I still think you're nuts, Big Sister. But I love you anyway."" He put a heavy hand on her shoulder. ""We still on for supper? I have Katie and the girls waiting in the car…"" Emma nodded. ""Let me move this stuff into the house, and I'll be ready."" ""I'll help…"" ""You carry the paint box and palette,"" she directed. ""I'll take care of El… I'll take care of my friend here."" Randy followed her instructions and placed the paint box, with the palette of colors, just inside the door of the sunroom. ""I'll wait for you in the car,"" he said, watching her set up the easel for a little while, and then stalked away. ""I'll be there in a bit,"" Emma called out, and then smiled at the face that gazed back at her from the canvas. ""See you in a little while, Grandfather,"" she said, and then covered the painting with a cloth to protect it until it was completely dry. She'd already decided to hang the portrait in her office, and had purchased a frame to fit the canvas days ago. Randy would scoff, no doubt; although perhaps one day she'd remind him where he'd seen that face before. But as for her, she knew seeing the face of distant family would be a comfort. And maybe, someday, she'd see him again. She hoped so. FIN"

Ada brought her close to the fire, and Ivoreth sighed as the warmth finally began to slow her shivers. He sat down and stationed her on his lap so that she faced the fire, and then reached up when Pilimor handed him a thin wooden trencher with what promised to be a succulent roast fish and some of the remaining bread. Ada set the trencher in Ivoreth's lap, but she shook her head and moved it to the ground next to her. ""I'm not hungry, Ada,"" she repeated. The smell of the food turned her stomach. Tired beyond all belief, she closed her eyes and leaned back against Ada, praying that she could avoid the scolding that was certain to come by falling asleep before it got started. ""Didn't Elrohir tell you that it was dangerous to be where you were after dark?"" Ada asked in his calm voice – the one that made Ivoreth cringe when he was reminding her of something she should have known or listened to. Still, she loved Ada enough to give him an honest answer, so she nodded. ""Then why…"" ""Because he hates me, and I just wanted to get away,"" slipped out before she had a chance to think. ""What?"" Ivoreth sighed again and turned to try to tuck her face into her Ada's shoulder. ""No, Ivoreth. What makes you think he hates you?"" Ada sounded confused and concerned. ""I asked him if he was going to be mad at me forever, and he said he didn't know,"" Ivoreth gave up with a shudder and pulled herself into a smaller ball on Ada's lap. ""He told me there was nothing I could do to make him like me again – and asked if I understood."" A small sob escaped. ""I didn't understand, and all I wanted to do was get away from him."" ""There are still wolves and other beasts who would find a girl like you a juicy meal, sweetling,"" Ada told her, pulling her to him again and then rubbing small circles onto her back through the blanket. ""He may still be angry with you, but he wouldn't want any harm to come to you. You should have come back with him when he called."" ""He doesn't care what happens to me, and it just hurts so much to see him…"" Ivoreth buried her face in the soft suede of Ada's tunic. She didn't have the words to tell him of her pain or how Elrohir's behavior wounded her. ""He cares, Ivoreth. If he didn't, he wouldn't still be angry."" It doesn't matter anymore. The only thing that is important anymore is to make sure that Ada doesn't stop loving me the way Elrohir has. ""I'm sorry I ran, Ada. I promise I won't do it again. I'll stay close to you and do exactly what you tell me."" Since that seemed to be the thing that Ada was most concerned about, it was an easy promise to make. She wouldn't run away from the camp again. She'd also never go anywhere near Elrohir again either - not if she could help it – and she'd certainly never try to talk to him at all anymore. Ada seemed to hear her inner thoughts the way he sometimes did when she was very upset. ""You need to be patient with Elrohir, little one. He has always been quick to anger and very slow to forgive, even when we were elflings. I know that you want to make things right, but the only way he'll accept is for you to leave him alone until he's ready to forgive, and then it will be an easy thing."" He inserted a finger beneath her chin and lifted her face to his, and her eyes opened and gazed sadly at him in the golden glow of the flames. ""Trust me, Ivoreth; I've been through this with him too, many times."" Somehow, knowing that Ada knew the pain of his brother's rejection helped a bit. Ivoreth bit her lip, nodded again and tucked her face back into his tunic. ""Now, won't you eat – just a little?"" She shook her head. ""I'm not hungry, Ada – really."" Her stomach growled, but she was sure that if she tried to eat, it would only come right back up again. Celebriel moved to sit down beside Ada and smoothed her hand over Ivoreth's head. ""Can you get me the salve from my bundle?"" Ada asked her in a soft voice. ""I need to treat the scratches on her body before they get infected."" ""Did she tell you anything?"" the elleth asked when she returned, and Ivoreth could hear the worry in her voice. ""It is as you suspected,"" Ada replied, and Ivoreth felt the first gentle application of an oily substance being rubbed into the worst of the gouges the thorns had left on her right arm. It stung, and she hissed a complaint but didn't shrink away from Ada's touch. After the first few times, she knew what to expect and didn't even hiss anymore. He wouldn't use that stuff if it wasn't going to help. ""I'm glad we'll be in LothLórien in the next day or so. Maybe the Lady can help her,"" Celebriel commented, holding out her arms. ""Here, give her to me; you can treat her better if I hold her."" ""I'm not certain that it's Ivoreth who needs the help at the moment,"" Ada replied, gently shifting Ivoreth into Celebriel's lap so that he could continue to treat the scratches. ""Go to sleep, nethben ,"" Celebriel soothed, running a hand over Ivoreth's tangled hair. ""Things will be better in the morning, I promise."" Better for whom? But Ivoreth had no more energy left with which to remain awake, and her eyes slid closed. Sindarin Vocabulary: Hiril nîn - my Lady Nethben - Little One Nuath - Shadow, a mild expletive"
378,2,0,2-Aearwen22-0.txt,lord-of-the-rings,Aearwen22,"""I keep fearing that if I open that door, I won't stop crying – and that I'll stop being of any use to anyone at all."" ""And yet, I tell you truly, the tears will remain there, no matter how long you stave them off,"" Thranduil added in a knowing whisper. ""Be it a single year or a thousand, they wait patiently for you to let down your guard."" ""A thousand years?"" Elara whispered, shocked into remembering the very different natures of their two races. ""You've been grieving for a thousand years?"" Thanduil sighed and loosened his hold on her. ""Almost two thousand, actually. Sad, isn't it? You would think that I would know better by now."" Elara reached up a hand bravely and touched the face of the Elvenking, finding it moist with tears of his own. ""What would be sadder would be if you don't take the time to speak to your son of her now, Majesty. After all this time, if you can tell me – a stranger and a mortal – of your love for her, how much more you could say to one whom she loved as well?"" The Elvenking was silent for a long moment. Then: ""My son faces great grief of his own – and soon. He has thrown in his lot with mortals, who will be gone all too soon. I would not add to his burden."" He sighed again. ""Besides, he has the sea-longing; he will eventually have no choice but to go West and yet I will never leave the Greenwood. I have already lost him, Elara!"" Thranduil's voice cried out with a new grief so great that Elara feared it near to overwhelming him. ""You have not lost your son yet, Thranduil, and you would not be adding to his burden by telling him of his mother."" Elara forgot for a moment she was speaking to a King in her sudden desire to give comfort to one who had been so generous to her in her time. ""Do for him as you did for me – tell him of the good that was your Lalaith. Do not hide your grief, but don't make it the issue. After all, it isn't you he seeks to know better – but her. Surely you have enough good memories to share with him that you can bridge that distance."" Suddenly the enormity of the social fumble she'd made crashed about her, and she slipped from her seat on the bench to her knees, her head nearly bent to the ground. ""Apologies, Sire! I didn't mean…"" ""Stop that! I told you I came to you tonight as a friend and not as a King,"" Thranduil chided gently, his hands lifting her up bodily and setting her back into her seat as if she weighed nothing. ""Sometimes friends have to scold each other – and I treasure those who can see their way past my position to do so when I need it."" He fell silent for a moment. ""And I think, Lady, that while your eyes may no longer see sunlight and shadow, your heart sees clearly enough. What's more, you have the courage to speak the truth when it needs to be given voice. I think I begin to understand what my son sees in mortals."" Elara felt the heat of embarrassment flood her face and was at a loss for a response. ""At least I'm no dwarf,"" Elara finally managed lamely, and she gave him a small smile with her quip in an attempt to lighten the mood. Her efforts bore fruit – a half-hearted chuckle. ""I'd say not – I hear that dwarf-women wear beards, as do their men-folk. Your cheek, on the other hand, is quite smooth."" Elara felt a fleeting touch along the edge of her face before his hand once more interwove its fingers with hers. Her jaw dropped open at the audacity of both the statement and the touch, and Thranduil's chuckle became lighter, more infectious. ""I tell you this truly, Lady – although I've never seen a dwarf female myself. This is what my son's heart-brother told me of his kin, and I've no cause to doubt his word."" His words paused for a moment, and then she heard a true laugh bubble up from deep within him. ""Can you imagine kissing such a one? All that hair…"" Elara shook her head as she laughed, relaxing a bit to hear more of the Thranduil she knew returning. Her success in moving him away from dangerously dark topics warmed her. ""You're feeling better now, Sire?"" she asked with a small smile. ""I think I like it better when you call me by name when the setting, as now, is private,"" the deep voice told her gently. ""But yes, to answer your question, my heart is much relieved, oddly enough."" ""Mine too."" Elara could hardly believe it – she had thought moving past the grief that had been given such freedom that day would be a battle hard to fight and harder to win. All it had taken was the shoulder and the confidence of a King – no, not a King, a friend. ""Thank you, Thranduil,"" she said with simple and unadorned gratitude. ""Thank you , Elara,"" the King replied warmly. Elara felt him stand. ""I know it's late, but would you consider accompanying me? I think I would like to show you my garden. It is most beautiful in the starlight."" His hand in hers pulled gently, and she rose to her feet. His garden – he was talking of taking her to his garden, the one he had shared with his wife. ""Will you tell me more about her?"" she asked quietly. ""If you will tell me more about your Timon."" Thranduil returned. Elara nodded. ""I would be most honored to visit your garden."" ""Good."" Thranduil's hand squeezed hers one more time before relinquishing it to rest on a high arm. ""This way, my Lady."""

Pain exploded within her head as her nose and face slammed into the stone of a nearby wall, and she heard the tearing of cloth as she fell into a bottomless pool of darkness and knew no more. oOoOo Reality returned to Ivoreth gradually, the intense pain slowly began to overwhelm her senses. I'm not dead yet? Her nose and cheeks felt as if they were on fire, she couldn't seem to open her eyes, nor could she move her right arm. From the depths of the darkness that still surrounded her, she tried to scream her pain, fear and desperation – but all that emerged from her lips was a low moan. ""Get those animals out of here!"" A rough man's voice ordered sharply from several paces away, the harsh sound of it making Ivoreth flinch violently and then moan in renewed agony – but it wasn't the voice of either of the men who had caught her. ""She's a thief and a murderess,"" shouted the first Guard. ""We were only doing our duty!"" ""What you two were intending to do to this child most certainly was not your duty – even if she were the things you say! You bring shame to your office – and to yourselves."" the rough-voiced man replied angrily. ""If you'd gotten any further, the lord there would have been within his rights to run you through."" Sounds of scuffling and cursing gradually faded away into the distance. Are they gone? I need to get up – I need… Get away… Before someone else comes… In an attempt to calm herself and think of a next action, Ivoreth breathed in through her nose; and then she coughed as the air dragged with it a choking, coppery liquid. The cough was pure agony, and she moaned again. Ivoreth felt a soft cloth wrap over and around her, and only then did she realize that she was naked. Very careful arms picked her up from where she lay and cradled her close. ""Easy, child. You're safe now."" A deep and musical voice sounded very close to Ivoreth's ear. She turned her head slightly and then whimpered when the agony exploded anew as she brushed her cheek against the chest of the one who held her now. Who is this? What has happened to me? Why can't I open my eyes? Why can't I move my arm? Let me go! ""Hush now,"" the musical voice soothed into her ear. ""All will be well, little one."" Ivoreth could tell she was being carried forth – but to where? And would she be imprisoned once there – leaving Raini and Daren to starve or to be caught and thrown into an orphanage and then sold as her Da had been? Daren doesn't know how to steal things without getting caught – I didn't want him to have to do that. And Raini's getting sick too often now on the bad food from the trash heaps. What am I going to do? They're going to die just like Evien did! She shuddered in fear and despair, and then moaned as the tremors only brought forth sharp, new aches and pains to join those already tormenting her. The steps taken grew faster, longer – more hurried. ""Merciful Powers, my lord!"" A woman's voice sounded this time as the movement that surrounded her came to a sudden halt. ""Bring her in here – and let me call…"" ""I can care for her myself,"" the musical voice announced with calm patience. ""Prepare a draught of poppy juice – and then a warm bath."" Ivoreth felt herself carried a few more steps and then very gently deposited on something soft and comfortable. The soft cloth was removed and another cover brought over her body before she had much of a chance to feel a chill. She heard the sound of water, and then a cool rag was laid very carefully over her aching nose, eyes and cheeks and another was then used to wipe over her mouth and at her forehead. ""Listen to me, little one."" The musical voice had moved close to her ear once more. ""Your eyes are swollen shut – and this is why you cannot see. Your nose is broken. But to care for you properly, we need to know all that is amiss. Do you hurt anywhere else?"" Ivoreth swallowed hard. ""A…arm,"" she finally managed. ""This one?"" Gentle fingers touched her right shoulder. The soft touch was another bolt of agony. Ivoreth whimpered and tried to squirm away, only to cry out from the pain of even that small movement. ""Here is the draught, my lord – and the bath is nearly prepared."" Strong arms slipped carefully behind Ivoreth's shoulders and lifted. ""Drink this, little one. It will help you sleep so that we might tend you without hurting you."" A tiny cup was put to her lips, and Ivoreth gagged on the first, bitter sip. She pressed her lips tightly together and shook her head. No! I can't sleep! I need to get back to Raini and Daren! Let me go! She would have struggled, but her body still wasn't paying attention to what she was asking of it. Just trying to move made her shoulder explode again, and she whimpered her pain. ""Yes, I know it tastes horrid,"" the musical voice seemed to sympathize even as the small cup was returned to Ivoreth's lips. ""But you need this. Finish now."" Slowly, sip by sip, Ivoreth choked and gagged the bitter draught down, grateful at last to be returned to her comfortable cushion when it was gone. A tear eased its way past swollen lids to drip down the side of her face and into her ear. What will they do when I don't come back? A large hand picked up her left hand and cradled it comfortingly – and this time, when the darkness came for her, it was warm and welcoming. And terrifying."

She wasn't sure if she felt more brazen because she thought she was genuinely doing her job well, or if she just enjoyed flirting with him. ""What is it again that you do?"" He chuckled, and his finger lazily drew patterns on the white tablecloth. ""I'm a patriot."" ""Is that what they call it?"" she asked, leaning across the table to speak with discretion. She knew exactly what Peeta's job as a Capitol spy entailed. Finnick Odair had been a spy for them for years before joining Thirteen's cause. He said most of his work was done between the sheets, when the target was sated and delirious with pleasure. ""People will say anything to keep you between their legs,"" Finnick had told her. ""That's surprising, given the job description,"" she said. He set his jaw and inspected her suspiciously. ""I'm very passionate,"" he said evenly. He shifted to mirror her position across the table, their fingertips brushing, and their eyes locked challengingly. ""Look, Katniss, why don't we stop beating around the bush. You know what I do, and I know exactly what you're trying to do right now."" She wasn't ready to admit defeat yet. ""And what am I doing?"" ""You work with Delly, don't you?"" he said, slouching against the back of his chair. His finger was tracing patterns along the tablecloth again, and his grin had fallen to something that expressed disappointment. ""I sort of figured, when you first started contacting me. You didn't even acknowledge that I existed when we went to school together. I guess I kind of hoped it was real. The connection."" Katniss felt a pang of guilt in her chest. They had grown somewhat close through their online correspondence. Shared rather intimately personal details about one another. Things she'd never even told Gale, her closest friend. She'd felt unnaturally at ease around him. Internet him anyway. Even in person she sort of relaxed around him. He was just as wounded and guarded as she was at times, yet charming and genuinely sweet. She had never chosen to acknowledge her growing affinity for him out loud, but knowing that it had been compromised — all for a job. She worried her lower lip between her teeth before lifting her gaze to him. ""Peeta, I'm —"" He chortled at her distress. ""You really are an amateur at this."" She scowled. ""Delly wasn't thinking,"" he continued. His voice much harsher than it was before. ""Pegging you on me, of all people? She thought because I had a hard on for you in high school, that I'd be putty in your hands."" ""Delly's your friend, Peeta,"" she said. ""Don't you trust her? If she's siding with the Separatists, don't you ever wonder if maybe the Loyalists are wrong?"" ""And you think your movement is so noble?"" he countered, setting his jaw. ""Have you ever questioned what exactly it is that you're fighting for?"" ""Then why did you let Delly go? Why not turn her in?"" Content with her rebuttal, Katniss reached for her water glass and took an easy sip. ""I've got my reasons,"" he said. ""I just don't make a show of it like you do."" This piqued her interest. Was Peeta working for someone outside the Capitol? ""Yeah? And what do you plan on doing with me?"" ""I haven't decided yet,"" he said, after a moment of consideration. ""I'd say torture, but I think you'd like it too much."" She narrowed her eyes at him, and he laughed far too playfully. His posture changed, and his eyes darkened as he leaned across the table. ""You've still got secrets to tell Katniss, and I haven't made you sing."" The pads of his fingers touched her cheek, causing her breath to hitch in the back of her throat. She was frozen. Unable to move or breathe on her own accord, she leaned eagerly into his touch. ""There are people listening,"" she finally managed to say. ""And you think they're going to rescue you?"" he said. ""I know for a fact that you can't hear them anymore, your ear piece is wedged somewhere in the rubber of my boot like a bug. And have you even bothered to check your vantage points for backup, because I assure you that they're no longer there."" Her eyes flitted to the bar and across the lounge towards the piano, where Finnick and Gale were supposed to be stationed. Both positions were empty, and Katniss admonished herself for not checking sooner. ""What are you going to do to me?"" she asked again, but her voice was dreamy, trapped in a daze. Her eyes fell to the glass of water and back to him. ""There's nothing in the water,"" he assured her, and to prove it, finished the glass himself. His hand touched her cheek again and he traced lazy with his thumb, as he had done with the table cloth before. ""What do you want me to do to you Katniss?"" ""Let me go,"" she said, but even she didn't believe the words when they tumbled from her mouth. ""I don't think you want that,"" he said, shaking his head. ""Show me,"" she said shakily. ""Show me how you think you'll get my secrets."" His grin widened and he dipped his finger between her breasts, wrapping the wire around the tip before pulling it taught. ""If your friends at the bureau are looking for information, I'm afraid my lips will be occupied for the rest of the night. Unless they want to listen to what you have to say. But I think they already know my name."" He stood from the table to help her from her seat, and momentarily had to catch himself against his chair, slightly dazed by his stumble. Katniss smirked as she followed him from the restaurant. She had him exactly where she wanted him."

Her arms circle around his neck and she buries her face into his chest. She can't lose him. ""I need space,"" she says, watching her tears bleed into his white tee shirt. His fingers tangle into her braid and his hand settles at the nape of her neck. ""You just had to tell me that,"" he says gently. ""Take all the time you need."" She spends the next three days in her own bubble. She's a zombie at work, and completes her assignments almost robotically. Her mother calls each day and on the third day she leaves a message. ""I've met someone,"" is all she says. Katniss hasn't spoken to her mother in years. When she went to college she essentially broke all ties. It was difficult for her mother when Katniss's father died. She became nearly catatonic in her grief, leaving Katniss to care for the family, which included her young sister. After a few years, her mother's mental health improved, but the damage was lasting. Katniss's sister, Prim, is the only family that Katniss still acknowledges. ""She wants for us to meet him,"" Prim tells her over the phone. ""She wants for us to be a family again."" Katniss is reluctant. A month ago she would have burned all bridges and never looked back, but now she feels a longing for this broken connection. She calls Peeta to ask if he'll come with her, and he agrees. Dinner with her mother is tense. Katniss isn't sure what to say and her mother seems to be just as perplexed. Peeta and Prim carry the conversation, skating around safe topics like work and the weather. Later, when they're cleaning up, Katniss finds herself alone with her mother. ""I didn't know how to be a whole person anymore,"" her mother admits when confronted about her breakdown. ""When you love somebody, it's easy to lose yourself in them."" Katniss understands. It's why she's spent years building a wall between herself and anyone who tries to care about her. To protect herself. Her mother touches her cheek gently. The contact is calming and Katniss finds herself leaning into it. ""It can be so wonderful, though,"" her mother promises. Katniss is silent during the drive home. All of the events from dinner are troubling, and she's not sure how to process them. ""You internalize too much,"" Peeta says. ""I'm just thinking,"" she says tiredly. ""We can talk, if you want to."" She doesn't know where to begin, and she doesn't know how Peeta could help her. He wouldn't understand. ""It's fine,"" she says shortly. ""It's not a burden, you know,"" he says. ""Sometimes it helps to vent."" She looks at him skeptically. ""I think my mother has ruined my ability to have a healthy relationship,"" she says bluntly. ""Mine too,"" he says with a nod. She muffles a bitter laugh. ""Yeah right!"" ""Have you met my mother?"" In all the years she's known him, she can't remember meeting his mother once. Maybe during their college graduation. She vaguely recalls an impatient, silvery blonde tapping her foot through the reception. She had scowl lines deeper than Katniss's. ""All my life I was constantly disappointing her. Nothing I did was ever good enough,"" he says. ""I felt worthless."" Without thinking, she places her hand over his on the center console. ""That's not true. You're so loving and generous with everyone you've ever met, even when they don't deserve it."" He smile sadly, and the lights from the streetlamps that buzz by shimmer in his round eyes. ""I like to feel needed, I guess."" He pulls into the parking garage beneath her apartment and kills the engine when he's reached her spot. Katniss is stunned silent at his admission, unable to move from her seat. She refuses to accept that he thinks this way of himself. That he doesn't appreciate how wonderful he is. That everyone doesn't appreciate it. All the Dellys and Bristels, and Cloves in the world. But most importantly, her. She turns in her seat and forces him to look at her. Her fingers trace every line of his face until every detail is memorized. ""I do,"" she says. ""I need you."" ""You don't,"" he starts to say, but she doesn't want to hear it. She crushes her lips to his and kisses him with frantic abandon, trying to show him how every ounce of her being needs him. It's absolutely terrifying but it's something she wants — no, needs to give him, and in the end she feels wonderful. ""It's almost our anniversary,"" Peeta says on day 25. He's sitting on the couch, scrolling through the channel guide while Katniss finishes the dishes in the kitchen. She leans her elbows on the kitchen island and smiles teasingly. ""What are you going to get me?"" ""That depends,"" he says, settling on some movie on Comedy Central. ""Day 30. Are you showing up for the date?"" She feels a nervous tick in her heart. At this point, it should be easy. She cares about him. She's falling in love with him. The future should be clear. She dries the last dish and takes her time placing it in the cabinet. ""We don't have to wait for day 30, I guess,"" she says. He bites back a smile then stands from the couch with a stoic nod, picking up his shoes in the process. ""Okay,"" he says, heading towards the door. ""We gave it a good shot."" He sighs dramatically along the way, and she doesn't want to amuse his pity party, but suddenly she finds herself darting after him. She stops him before he can reach the handle. ""Let's see where this goes,"" she says, wedging herself between him and the door. ""30 more days?"" he asks, a beaming grin already tugging at his lips. ""And maybe a few more."""
382,1,4,1-Abagail-Snow-4.txt,hunger-games,AbagailSnow,"to survive. The only exception to this was her sister, Prim. She would do anything to make her sister happy and would deny her nothing. Prim was a dreamer. She dreamed bigger than the moon and would shine brighter than the sun. The only way Katniss would be able to provide for Prim's dreams of becoming a doctor though, would be to win the lottery. Prim was bright, but she wasn't the smartest in her class. She'd be eligible for some scholarships, that was for sure, but a free ride was all they could afford at this point. Singing was the only thing that Katniss was good at (that and perhaps her camping skills, something that wasn't exactly going to pay the bills.) When she sang, people stopped to listen. She learned that on the streets during her days of busking. She always drew the largest crowds. It was a gamble to rely on something as unpredictable as show business, but the reward would be worth it. Katniss pulled into a spot in front of her apartment building and turned off the engine. The third window up, second from the left, glowed with light meaning that Prim was home. Their building wasn't in the best part of town and Katniss hated having to leave her sister alone at night. Prim was in the kitchen, putting away clean dishes. Her blonde hair was piled on top of her hair in a messy bun. She looked so grown up for a moment that Katniss had to remind herself that she was nearly fifteen now. She wasn't just her kid sister anymore. ""Did he come?"" She asked hopefully, her blue eyes shinning with excitement. ""He did,"" she replied. ""All it took was two songs,"" she said, omitting a few rather important details. ""I knew he would love you!"" She clapped her hands excitedly. ""Are you going to begin recording right away? I bet he has a huge studio in his house."" Katniss frowned. Moving across the small living space, she shrugged off her jacket and let it drop onto the couch. It was met with a hiss. She pushed aside the leather jacket and the bundle of blankets until she was met with a pair of round yellow eyes focused on her with a challenging glare. ""Please don't be mad!"" Prim pleaded. A matted orange cat with his nose pushed upwards between his eyes swatted at Katniss with claws fully extended. Katniss darted away and lifted her hand at the feline, ready to strike back. Buttercup. Never in her life had she anticipated that her sworn enemy would come in the form of a nine pound lump of fur. ""You know we can't have pets here Prim,"" she said pointedly. ""He's been looking for us Katniss. He's been sleeping under your car every night waiting for us to come home!"" The flea bag had adopted them outside of a Wendy's dumpster during their stint of being homeless. It was the first full meal that Katniss was able to purchase for her and her sister in weeks and Prim just had to share it with that thing because it looked so hungry .Prim didn't realize how hungry she looked too. Needless to say, the cat was smart and knew how to cash a free ticket. They hadn't been able to shake the thing since. ""I'll look after him, I swear. You won't even notice he's here!"" Prim clasped her hands beneath her chin and her round blue eyes were glazed with threatening tears. In an instant she looked like a child again. Katniss tried to keep her expression hard, but her face immediately fell. ""Fine,"" she groaned. ""But you're going to have to check with Hazelle to see if having that vermin in her house is all right."" ""The Hawthornes?"" She asked. ""Why are we staying there? Are we in trouble again?"" ""No, we're doing fine,"" or as fine as the minimal requirement. Katniss moved to the kitchen and traced her fingers along the awful puke green colored Formica counter top. ""I just have to go away for a little while. To Los Angeles. It was a part of my agreement with Haymitch, to get him to represent me. I'm going to be on The Mockingjay."" ""The Mockingjay?"" Prim squealed. ""Katniss that's amazing. Everybody watches The Mockinjay! You'll be signed for sure. You'll win for sure, I just know it!"" ""I'll do my best,"" she replied, not having the heart to say otherwise, especially when Prim seemed so excited about the prospect. ""I'm not sure how long I'll be gone. It may be only a week."" She approached her sister and held her shoulders at arms length. ""Be sure to lend a hand at the Hawthornes,"" she instructed. ""Even if Hazelle insists you don't have to."" ""I don't see why I have to stay there,"" she said with a huff. ""I'm almost fifteen! I don't need a babysitter."" ""It's not you I worry about,"" Katniss lied. ""It's the morons that live in this building."" Prim rolled her eyes, but didn't argue. ""I'm so excited for you,"" she said instead and threw her arms around Katniss to hug her tightly. Katniss squeezed her sister tightly. ""When I get back, we'll have enough money to send you to the best medical school in the country,"" she said. ""I promise."" Prim pulled away with a frown. ""And you'll be doing what you love too,"" she said and took both of Katniss' hands in hers. It was supposed to be a statement, but there was no denying the questioning lilt to her tone. ""Right?"" It didn't matter what Katniss wanted. She lived a simple life. All she wanted was for her sister to be well fed and happy. She didn't need any happiness for herself. Didn't hold metrics for her own benefit. To want something was a dangerous waste of time. But she wouldn't lay that burden of guilt on her sister. ""Of course,"" she said in reply."
383,1,12,1-Abagail-Snow-12.txt,hunger-games,AbagailSnow,"Bracing one arm on the rail beside her, he slipped his fingers between her legs and pressed firmly against the swollen bundle of nerves, rubbing his fingers with tight, unforgiving ministrations. His chest was pressed against her back and he kissed her bare shoulder before moving to catch her earlobe between his teeth. He could recognize the feeling of her walls clenching around him and he drew his other hand to her breast, which he freed from the neckline of her dress. Plying the small mound in his palm against the pebbled peak, she bit down on her hand to muffle her shouts. She molded against him. Stretching. Stretching. And then she went still. She collapsed against the railing with a languid cry, her elbows buckling so that her body was hanging from the rail. He followed quickly after, spilling into her with a few more pushes. He pulsed inside of her as he rode out his orgasm, his chest heaving to regain his breath. ""Jesus, Katniss,"" he sighed heavily into her neck. She sat up on her elbows and looked at him over her shoulder with an arched brow. ""Katniss?"" He narrowed his eyes, unamused. ""I'm impressed you remember my name."" He pulled out and debated using the sleeve of his rented tux to clean himself, but Katniss had already scooped up her purse to retrieve a package of tissues. The lake, where Finnick and Annie were having their wedding reception, had a few empty boat houses along the dock slips. From where they were at the edge of the water, they could still hear the thumping bass beat from the white tent at the top of the hill. ""It's only been a few weeks,"" he chuckled, tucking himself back into his dress pants and fastening his belt. ""That's an endless string of one night stands,"" she said. She pulled her panties up from around her ankles and smoothed her skirt over her hips so that the hem hit the top of her knees and the lines they had wrinkled into it were no longer visible. ""Thirty, maybe,"" he said. He pulled his vest over his clean ivory shirt and adjusted the buttons at the cuffs. ""That's it?"" she said, leaning her hip against the railing so that her back faced the water. She smiled at him slyly, in challenge. He trapped her between his arms against the railing. ""You really want to know that?"" he asked, leaning in to nuzzle her neck with wet kisses. She pushed weakly against his chest to crane her neck so that her wide, gray eyes were looking into his. ""There's no one else but you."" Her lips pressed into a thin line. She bowed her head for a brief moment before lifting her chin to regain her composure. ""How was your trip?"" she said evenly. ""Honestly?"" he said, grinning sheepishly. Pushing off the rail he moved to the other side of the boat house. ""I've been staying at my parents house, working at my dad's bakery."" They lived about thirty minutes outside of the city, a risky move since Katniss's mother lived the next neighborhood over, but Katniss rarely went home, and his path never crossed with Mrs Everdeen. ""Oh,"" Katniss said. ""I didn't realize you were so close."" He combed his fingers through his hair, which was matted and disoriented from earlier. ""I was planning to go out to Colorado, where my brother lives. I was waiting for the wedding though. In case Finnick needed me."" She folded her arms over her chest, her mouth curling into a scowl. ""Are you still going?"" she asked shortly, her eyes downcast towards the weathered plank floor. ""Maybe. I don't know."" ""This is ridiculous,"" she huffed. ""If you don't want to go, then don't. I'll leave you alone either way, if that's what you want."" ""I thought I would get some clarity, you know?"" he said, smiling sadly. ""If I'm not going to work for my dad? What else is for me to do?"" He sank to the floor, drawing his knees to his chest and leaning against the wall behind him. ""You're really good at baking,"" she said. He nodded earnestly. ""I know."" ""What about art?"" She approached him carefully, smoothing her palms nervously over her skirt before sitting beside him. ""You could open that gallery you've always wanted."" ""There's nothing very glamorous about a starving artist,"" he said, rolling his neck tiredly to look at her beneath the hood of his eyes. ""You wouldn't have to be starving."" ""Katniss, I know you're blinded by your love for me, but my art isn't that spectacular,"" he said wryly. She slapped his arm. ""What I meant is that I'd hunt and you'd paint, and we'd make it work. Although you'd still have to bake for me. It's the least you could do if I'm going to support you."" ""Katniss,"" he said, his tone warning. ""Peeta,"" she countered. ""I've been doing some thinking. A lot, actually. And while I can't say yes yet, someday I will, and it will be to you."" His jaw slackened as he looked at her in awe. He couldn't deny her. Maybe he was wrong about needing to grow without her. Maybe they needed to grow together. He took her hand into his and drew it to his lips. ""I can live with that."" Draping his arm across her shoulder, he pulled her against his chest. He dropped his chin to rest onto of her head, smiling at the familiar flowery scent in her hair. ""About this proposed arrangement,"" he said, lowering his hand to the dip of her waist to pinch her side playfully. ""Shall we discuss my other qualifications for earning my keep?"" She tipped her head to kiss him. ""You can show me."" Bonus Quote: ""I was born when she kissed me. I died when she left me. I lived a few weeks while she loves me"" from the 1950 Humphrey Bogart film ""In a Lonely Place"""

Finally, she leaped off the platform, landing in his row as the boat swept by. ""So are you just going to jump again when you're ready to get off?"" he asked, still skeptical about the whole thing. ""Are you crazy? It's on a timer."" The swinging gondola at Capitol was bigger. It was twelve rows, as opposed to six, and was some pharaoh like, Egyptian theme. It could also swing so high that Peeta could have swore it flipped all the way over. The Pirate Ship at Arena was not nearly as impressive. That was until Katniss Everdeen was sitting beside him. ""Why is this ride your favorite?"" he asked, admiring the way the lights sparkled in her eyes each time they swung higher and higher. ""This moment,"" she said. ""Right here,"" she said, right as the boat paused at its peak then dropped, leaving him weightless. Floating briefly before soaring down to the earth. Peeta had been familiar with the sensation before. Flying. A fleeting feeling he was always chasing after. But he knew where to find it now. He waited for the boat to swing back again, right at the peak when there was nothing but darkness below them. Then he turned to kiss her, her lips melting to his as they began to fall freely. Her expression was unreadable when he pulled away. Some mixture of surprise and confusion, and maybe anger for all he could tell. Peeta braced himself on the handrail, certain that she was plotting to throw him overboard. ""Was that okay?"" he said carefully, still trying to gauge her reaction. She was silent, probably set on never speaking to him again. Her eyes were locked frozen on his lips. ""I'm sorry,"" he said. ""I just really wanted to kiss y–"" but then she was kissing him again, her fingers tangled in the curls at the nape of his neck. She hummed approvingly against his lips, her tongue licking into his mouth in languid strokes that made his groin tighten. With every swing of the ride he needed to be closer to her. Needed the feel of her wrapped around him and the welcoming heat between her legs. Soon she was pressed between him and the guardrail. Her thighs straddling his hips, and his hands at her waist, holding her firmly against him. At the next peak, his hips lifted from the bench, bucking against her with a friction that offered momentary relief to his straining erection. His cock was throbbing to be inside her, so much so that he could hardly see straight. ""Fuck, Katniss,"" he groaned into her hair when her hips rolled against his thigh. He slipped his hand between where their bodies were woven together, his fingers dipping between her legs to rub her through her khaki shorts. ""You sure you don't want anything?"" he murmured, latching his lips to suck on her pulse point as they road through the next peak. ""Do you want me to touch you?"" She cried out, nodding frantically in response. ""I'm going to make you fly, Katniss."" His other hand untangled from her hair, sliding down her body to tuck beneath the hem of her loose fitting polo. He rolled up the material, exposing new spans of olive flesh until he reached her breasts. He sighed at the sight. The soft mounds concealed behind thin, pale colored fabric. He held one experimentally in his palm, plying and molding it between his fingers until her nipple was pebbled into a hardened peak. Then he lavished the other breast with the same attention. Her fingers dug sharply into the muscles along his shoulders, guiding his ministrations with appreciative tugs and moans. The height of the car's swings began to ebb too soon. Each sway drawing closer to the platform. Peeta began to panic. He wanted to make her come before the thrill of the ride died down. He wanted her to think of him, of this, every time she felt this high. He undid the button of her shorts deftly, pushing them aside to slip his fingers into her underwear. Her folds were slick with want and he coated his fingers in her arousal, using it as lubricant to draw tight circles around her clit. ""You sure you don't want anything, Katniss?"" he grunted, his finger swirling fervently against her. ""I want you,"" she admitted, and her entire body shuddered against his hand. The words were the most beautiful he had ever heard and he buried his face in her shoulder to muffle his groan. All the passion in his life that he had been missing suddenly consumed him. In the way he kissed her, the way his fingers moved inside her, drawing her to an orgasm just as the ride began to still. Her breathing was still labored, her chest rising and falling in shallow pulses. Her tongue swept across her swollen lips, and she sat back on her heels to look at him. ""You ready to get off?"" she asked when the ride was mostly still. His eyes were too hooded to focus on anything, and all he could do was chuckle. ""You have no idea."" She rolled her eyes and began to climb off his lap. She'd have to engage the break to bring the ride to a stop fully. Before she could regain her balance, he caught her elbow, pulling her back against his chest for another heated kiss. ""Take your clothes off,"" he said. ""I want to go again."" A/N: This is a plot bunny I had that is very loosely based on the movie Adventureland. Sorry it got a little spastic at the end because I can't write smut from the male POV. Sorry I haven't written anything in forever! Hopefully as the summer winds down I'll have some more time and focus. As usual you can find me on tumblr at absnow ."

He looked at the time on his phone. ""It's late, let me walk you back."" Katniss could see her dorm from the front entrance of the library. ""Okay,"" she said anyway. He escorted her to her room and when he thanked her and wished her a good night, for the first time, she didn't want him to leave. Delly appeared a moment later. Her face splotchy from cleaning her makeup. ""Was Peeta here?"" she said. ""I thought I saw him in the hall."" ""Um, yeah,"" Katniss said, suddenly feeling shy about the night they'd shared. ""He needed help with something."" ""I'm really sorry if he's still bugging you,"" Delly said with an annoyed sigh. ""He's got this huge crush on you and I keep telling him that you're not interested."" Katniss didn't know what to say. The way he'd been acting around her - she never thought for a second that it was because he liked her. ""I'll talk to him again if you want?"" Katniss felt trapped in a trance. She blinked a few times then reached for her laptop. ""No. It's fine,"" she said, climbing up into her bed and opening the computer lid. ""I must be such a bother to you,"" Finnick Odair said. He dipped his toe into the clear water, sending sparkling ripples across the surface from the setting sun. ""I should take a hint, really. All this time I've sat with you and you haven't said a word. You won't even tell me your name."" He moved to stand. She caught his wrist, giving it an urgent squeeze. ""Stay!"" she meant to shout. ""Please, stay with me."" He sat back down, his eyes a lit with alarm. Her name. She could tell him her name. She searched the horizon for an answer and it came to her like a spark. She pointed at the bend of her leg, taking his hand in hers to tap his finger against it. ""Knee?"" he said. She nodded. ""Kneeeeeee,"" he sounded the word on his tongue again to see if it would morph into something else. His smile brightened with understanding. ""Annie! Your name is Annie!"" She felt like she was dancing on wind, hearing her name from his lips. ""And mine is,"" he said bending over to draw an imaginary triangle on his back, a fin, then he gagged and shuttered to say ""ick."" She twisted her lanky arms around his neck to hug him tightly. ""Annie, my Annie,"" she could feel him murmur into her hair. There were only two dorms on the east side of campus, and she heard Peeta and Delly mention Baker hall before. ""A baker in Baker, how poetic,"" Delly had said. The mailboxes were set up the same as in her building, with each row coordinating with the floor the person lived on. She was able to limit the eight floors down to three by the names, since there weren't any coed floors here. Peeta lived on the sixth, she finally figured out. His room was tucked into the corner and there was no question as to whether he was home because the door was propped open with a trashcan. She tapped on the frame to get his attention. He had a pad of paper in his lap and was busy sketching. ""Hey,"" he said with a pleasant smile. She was obviously the last person he'd expected to see. ""Hey,"" she said. ""Lost?"" She certainly felt like it. She shifted awkwardly on her heels then took a few steps inside without asking. He'd invaded her space often enough, it was her turn to do it for a change. ""What are you drawing?"" she said. He laughed nervously. ""You caught me."" He lifted the pad for her to see. It was a drawing of Annie and Finnick sitting on the dock. The one from her story. ""I accidentally immersed myself in the fandom world. I saw some art that was pretty cool and felt inspired, I guess."" She took the paper, tracing her fingers along the smudged lines. ""You have an incredibly strange way of flirting,"" she said. ""I assure you, I'm usually much better at this,"" he said. ""I honestly have no idea how to talk to you. I was just looking for a way to relate - you're kind of terrifying, you know."" ""Sorry."" ""Did this Snow guy cast an evil spell on you too?"" ""Sometimes it feels that way,"" she said. She leaned against his desk and handed the drawing back to him. ""And what did you lose because of it?"" he said. ""The power of perception, maybe. I didn't realize - I didn't know that you liked me."" ""Because you thought that I was with Delly,"" he filled in. ""No. Because I thought you were being a jerk to me. I thought you were making fun of me."" ""I wasn't. Really."" He tapped on the paper in her hand for emphasis. ""If you couldn't tell yet."" ""I've got that now."" She set the drawing down and gripped the edge of his desk. ""I like you too,"" she admitted. He lifted both brows in surprise, and she had to smile at the childlike gleam in his eyes. ""Really? And you came all this way to tell me that. You know I would have found a way to bug you again."" She steeled her nerves with one deep breath. ""I had an idea for a story actually."" She braced her hands on his shoulders and slipped from his desk into his lap. ""I was hoping you could help."" ""I do owe you one,"" he said, his eyes darkening as his hands slid around her waist. ""Please let this be one of those really hot smutty ones."" She angled her chin to brush her lips over his. ""You tell me,"" she said. Find me on tumblr ( absnow )"
386,1,2,1-Abagail-Snow-2.txt,hunger-games,AbagailSnow,"Her features are delicately round and incomparable to any image she's ever seen in her own reflection. She tries to see herself, but can't. If they've made a clone of her, shouldn't they look alike? The tapping of footsteps approach her in the heavily traveled corridor, but she makes no move to acknowledge her newest companion. ""It's a miracle, really. That you've found her again. I think she has your smile."" ""Excuse me?"" Katniss says. Plutarch stands beside her, his eyes looking adoringly at the young infant through the portal. ""Your daughter,"" he says. ""The tests haven't confirmed it yet, but one of my sources from the Capitol – she came back with the rescue, says that she was the one who performed the operation."" ""The operation?"" she narrows her eyes and shakes her head incredulously. ""What operation? Part of the rescue?"" ""No, no, to harvest your child, of course,"" Plutarch says. Katniss looks at him curiously. ""There was no baby,"" she says. ""We made it up."" ""That's what we'd assumed too. Imagine our surprise when it turned out to be true. I was out of the loop for most of it, rebellion and all,"" he says, as if everything was all well and normal. ""But look at that. Here she is."" ""I never had a baby,"" she says. ""I think I'd remember."" ""Not the natural way,"" he agrees. ""Like they force you to in the districts. No one carries a child to term in the Capitol. The women would lose their figures, and nine months is an awfully long time to wait for a child."" Katniss stares at him skeptically and he carries on, oblivious to her confusion. ""As soon as a pregnancy is detected, they have the child removed. The incubation period is up to the parents, of course. Some prefer an authentic term, nine months, as the districts experience. Others wait a full year, so that their homes can be properly renovated. But most are too impatient. They'd lose interest before the baby was even delivered. It's my understanding that your girl was one of the more ambitious procedures. Only a week of incubation."" He pauses. ""They wanted to have her ready for the end of the Games. A tragic reunion, in case one of you survived."" ""I doubt Snow intended on either one of us surviving,"" Katniss says flatly. But a poor orphaned girl made to suffer due to her parents' insolence would certainly be a powerful image. ""I don't understand though,"" she says. ""It has to be a mutt. I couldn't have been…"" pregnant, is what she can't work up the courage to say. ""The level of hormones in your blood was nearly undetectable,"" Plutarch says. ""My source – she said that based off the size of the fetus, it couldn't have been more than a few days from conception. She was surprised you even knew."" Couldn't have been more than a few days. The train. On the way to the Games. She never thought anything of it — certainly she had thought of it. In the darkness of night with her pearl clutched against her heated skin, but she never thought… And then she can feel it again. The heat on her skin from where his lips had touched her neck as they embraced on the train. It had felt so good that she had buried her face against him in the same way. And they had stood there, embracing one another as the train rocked them slowly, almost hypnotizing in rhythm. Then his lips began to move against her throat. Hot and hungry and warm. It had felt so impossibly good that she was consumed by this need for him. The places where their skin touched hadn't been enough, and they hunted for more. Shedding one another from their clothing until their naked bodies were flush and tangled on the plush couch in the train car. Not once had her mind intervened with her body's desire. There were no consequences to fear, because to suffer a consequence, there needed to be a future. And for them, nothing past tomorrow existed. And so she opened herself to the warm, and curious stirring in her chest that she hadn't felt since the cave. It spread fast, like fire. The flames wild and seemingly impossible to extinguish. Until he was inside her, containing the intense quiver between her legs with long even thrusts. Taming it, then building it into utter bliss. They had laid there, breathless. His head resting on her breasts, and her fingers matted in his damp blond curls. ""Never leave me,"" she had pleaded. ""Promise that you'll stay with me."" He had pressed a kiss to where her heart beat then looked up at her with a crooked grin and tender blue eyes. It made her feel complete. ""Always,"" he had said. But that wasn't the first, or the last time that he made that vow. Hidden in her consciousness, they work their way into her memory. The night when she had leapt over the fence, and he carried her to bed. He held her hand, and right before she fell asleep, she had asked him to stay, but never heard his answer. Always. And again, the night before the Games, she had asked him to hold her and he had whispered something against her forehead that she didn't understand. Always. But where was he now? The man strapped to a chair across the hall certainly wasn't him. The child stirs and slowly wakes, looking at Katniss curiously, through the small,portal window. And then she sees them. Those blue eyes she has been searching for since Peeta's abduction are staring back at her, but they're not his. Or are they? None of this makes sense. ""Aeternum,"" she says absently, it's an ancient word from a language that has long ceased to exist. But it surfaces in her mind like Peeta's eternal promise. ""Lovely,"" Plutarch beams. ""Is that what she is to be called?"""

She finds him where she left him. His fingers are stained the color of Nightlock, but the cannon wasn't for him, it was for the fox faced girl from District Five. She lays lifelessly beside Peeta's jacket, her skin pale and her lips purple. ""She must have eaten them,"" Peeta says. ""I told you not to pick Nightlock, Peeta!"" she says. Her heart is still beating too fast and she feels dizzy. She braces herself against a tree, and falls into his arms when he reaches to comfort her. ""It's okay,"" he whispers into her hair. Her eyes are unfocused because of the tears that cloud them. She stares at the girl from Five and her lifeless eyes. Then to the jacket. Peeta had been picking wine berries, but there isn't a pile for them, just a heaping pile of Nightlock. Realization strikes her. ""You knew she was following us, didn't you?"" ""I suspected it,"" he says. She steps out of his arms, backing away from him with careful steps. ""It was a trap."" ""I knew you wouldn't eat the berries."" She shakes her head. ""You killed her."" She feels sick again. ""Just like Glimmer."" ""Katniss..."" he says, his voice too gentle for someone so cruel. She reaches for an arrow from her quiver and holds it to her bow. ""You know how the Games work, Katniss. Not everybody gets to go home, and I'm not taking my chances. It's us or them."" She laughs at this. ""There's no us in the end,"" she says. ""It's you or them, me included. What are you going to do after the 22nd cannon sounds?"" He looks away. ""I haven't figured that out yet."" She keeps the tip of her arrow aimed towards the ground, but she's ready to shoot him in a second if she has to. ""What about you?"" he says. ""You're the one with the bow. What are you going to do with me?"" She drops her arrow back in its quiver and collects the berries from the ground - the Nightlock too, although she isn't sure why. She kills Cato. He's the last tribute left besides them, and the three of them are chased by mutts towards the cornucopia for the grand finale. Cato is bigger than both of them, but he's wounded from fighting Thresh, and hungry from being without food. Peeta manages to overpower him until a mutt catches his leg, ripping into his calf. Cato holds Peeta dangerously close to the edge of the cornucopia, using him as a shield. ""I'll make it easy for you,"" Cato tells her tauntingly. ""A two for one deal."" She has her arrow trained on him. She could hit Peeta first, then Cato with time to spare. She can win. She's going to win. She hesitates to let her arrow fly, and when it does, it pierces Cato right in the eye. He falls from the cornucopia for the mutts to take him away. The 22nd cannon sounds, leaving her face to face with her final rival. Peeta doesn't even have a weapon, and he can't stand on his own with the fresh wound in his leg. ""Come on, Katniss,"" he encourages her. ""Aren't you ready to go home?"" Survive, Katniss, survive. Her father's words still echo in her ears. But how can she now? Every second of her life she'll be haunted by this moment. She can't take away the life of the boy who saved hers. She can't kill the boy that she's loved her whole life. Her hands tremble when she knocks her bow. She holds her breath to trap the sob that threatens to rip through her chest. The tears that cloud her eyes make it too difficult to aim. He staggers towards her, practically dragging his leg behind him. ""Please, do it,"" he says, pushing the tip of the arrow into his chest where his heart is. ""Do it Katniss."" The arrow goes limp and she drops the bow before falling into his arms. ""I can't,"" she says. ""I can't."" ""I'm not going to make it much longer,"" he says. He winces, unable to stand for another moment and collapses against the cornucopia. ""Do me a favor, put me out of my misery."" She falls to her knees beside him to inspect his wound. It's bad. Deep. Blood spurts from it, indicating that it's probably an artery. ""You need a tourniquet,"" she says, frantically searching through her supplies. ""I need to die,"" he says, stilling her struggle. He tips up her chin, forcing her to look at him, and then they're kissing desperately. She presses her forehead against his and chokes back another sob. ""Let me stop the bleeding,"" she says. ""I'm not ready to let you go yet."" She looks through her backpack for a piece of rope, but pauses when her fingers wrap around the bundle of Nightlock. If Peeta can get to a doctor soon, they can save him. She can't keep him alive much longer. She fills her palm with berries and brings them to her lips. ""Katniss, stop!"" Peeta pulls her hand away. ""I'm not leaving here without you,"" he tells her. Their eyes meet and an unspoken agreement is made. He kisses her one last time with cold lips, slipping some of the berries from her hand as he pulls away. If both of them can't live, than neither of them will. Her eyes don't leave his as she presses the Nightlock past her lips. ""I love you,"" she wants to tell him, but he must already know. ""Wait! Wait!"" The voice of Claudius Templesmith echos through the arena. They both spit the berries from their mouth and look up in surprise.

388,1,6,1-Abagail-Snow-6.txt,hunger-games,AbagailSnow,"she noticed Peeta was staring at her in complete awe. ""You can't watch,"" she admonished him, trying to fight the rush that surged through her from beneath his gaze. He turned away and she continued to undress until she was completely nude. She poised herself carefully on the edge of the chair, her arms draped over her chest and lap to cover herself. There was something strangely thrilling about sitting there naked. She felt confident. She felt free. A spark of energy ignited in her chest,which spread to the tips of her fingers and toes. It was too much to contain, curled up and covering herself this way. She kicked her feet up to rest on the windowsill and stretched her legs wide. Her back arched to lean against the back of the chair and her arms hung boneless by her sides to lay completely exposed before the window. Suddenly every fiber of her being ached to be touched. The cool night air kissed her nipples, pebbling them into sensitive buds, and below the stretch of her abdomen, beneath the shroud of dark hairs, she felt an eager buzz come to life. She thought of Peeta on the other side of the room, and another wave of heat twisted and pooled between her legs. Her eyes lifted to the window, and in the reflection, she spotted him, looking at her. Their eyes locked in the hazy image of their reflections. She wanted to be angry with him for betraying his word, but she liked that he was watching her. Ten seconds passed, maybe more. Finally she turned her chair to face him again. His eyes darted away, and he began to whistle sheepishly as if their moment in the window had never happened. Katniss didn't want it to be over though. Not yet. ""Peeta?"" she said, her voice a bit frantic. ""I dare you to touch me."" He licked his lips and bounced anxiously on his heels. His dark blue eyes were shadowed by a hunger she couldn't recognize as they implored hers. After a moment of hesitation, he moved to the entrance, flipping the locks on the door and pulling down the metal shade. Then in three long strides, he was pulling the cage over the window too. He sighed heavily and paced the space between them, pausing when he stood before her. ""Where?"" he said huskily. ""Tell me."" Katniss's lips parted, unable to make a sound. She wasn't sure how to describe what she needed. She'd touched herself before, but she was never in the right mindset. She felt foolish instead of finding the intended pleasure. There was nothing funny about what she felt now. She knew where her body ached for him, and decided to start there. She took his hand and pressed it firmly against breast, guiding the ministrations until he could repeat the motion on his own. He cupped the soft mound, plying it experimentally between his fingers, and she hummed softly in approval. She encouraged him to her other breast, but instead of lifting his hand, he dropped to his knees and lowered his mouth to attend to it. His tongue swirling over her tightened peak before pinching it between his teeth, the sharp pain leaving her feeling delirious. The pulsing between her legs became unbearable no matter how she shifted her thighs to quell it. She ushered his hand from her chest and pushed his fingers against where her body throbbed to be touched. ""Jesus,"" he said, collapsing against her shoulder to groan against her skin. ""Katniss, you're so wet."" She lifted her hips to open herself to him, sighing when his fingers began to stroke through her slick folds to coat in her arousal. Then he painted tight circles around her swollen bundle of nerves, building the tempo until she was shouting from the blissful agony. His tongue continued to lick and nip around her breast, and she could feel the stiffness of his erection grinding against her calf as he touched her. Her mind was clouded by lust, demanding for more, more, more. Never sated. He gripped at the arm of her chair with his free hand and used it to steady himself against her. ""Truth or dare; you'll let me taste you,"" he growled into her ear. He kissed her then. Licking along the seam of her lips, before his tongue plunged into her mouth with such firm, deliberate strokes that she clenched her knees together in anticipation. ""Yes,"" she hissed, practically begging. ""Both. Please."" The pressure from his fingers left her and she lifted her hips to chase after his touch. He pinned her to the chair, drawing her ass to the edge of the seat to spread her legs wide. Then he settled between her thighs, his dark eyes looking up at her before his tongue tentatively darted out to trace along her opening. ""Oh,"" she said at the new sensation of his tongue against her. ""Oh!"" she said again, loudly this time, when his tongue swirled over her clit. Her fingers knotted into his hair with both hands, and she urged him eagerly towards the motions that brought the most pleasure. He sucked on the bundle at her apex while his fingers dipped inside her, one then two, maybe three, thrusting and stretching, and she threw her head back to call out his name from the feel of him moving within in her. She cried out when the final flick of his tongue pushed her over the edge. His fingers coaxed her over the crest of her orgasm. Long, even strokes guiding her back to her body. He looked up at her from between her legs, his chin and mouth glistening from her arousal. Katniss combed her fingers through his hair to smooth out his disheveled curls. ""I wasn't even supposed to be here today,"" she said through an exhausted fit of laughter. He kissed her thigh, her stomach, then her lips. ""Well, I'm glad you came."""
389,1,23,1-Abagail-Snow-23.txt,hunger-games,AbagailSnow,"sigh. ""Maybe it's because it was all pretend, but sometimes I recall this overwhelming urge – like this instinctual need..."" It's a feeling she knows all to well. One that she was only beginning to understand that night on the beach, and one that confuses her more and more since his return. ""A hunger,"" she says, and she's not sure if it's out loud or deep in her thoughts. ""Yeah,"" he says. ""I guess that's it. It's like there are two voices in my head, pushing me in different directions. I don't know what I did to stop it back then, and I keep on trying to fight this monster inside of me, but he always wins."" She thinks about her own darkness. She was able to kill in the Games without thought if it meant her survival. Why was her life more important than Marvel and Cato and the others? Peeta's always been different though. Even Haymitch and Finnick could see it. He was better than the other victors because he was inherently good. At least that's how she always saw him. But maybe that's because she didn't want to see the alternative. ""Maybe it's always been a part of you,"" she says. ""What?"" ""The monster,"" she says. ""Maybe that anger has always been there, deep down."" ""Sometimes I feel like her ,"" he says, and she can tell he means his mother, even though he doesn't say it. ""She allowed herself to become so bitter because of the way her life turned out. That's why she was so cruel. That's how I used to feel when I looked at you, once I wasn't afraid of you anymore. I was mad that you never loved me and the more I was around you the more foolish I felt for not noticing before. It made me angry all over again."" ""I wish you would have gotten angry,"" she says. ""I deserved it."" ""It wouldn't have done any good."" ""I think it would have."" She's still standing at the foot of his bed, and she leans against the wall beside it. ""There are walls we build to protect ourselves, never realizing that the things that terrify us may be something that we need."" ""What are you afraid of?"" he asks, his fingernail picking at the clumpy knot he's woven. ""Hurting people,"" she says. He laughs. ""That's not true. You do that all the time. It takes one to know one."" She frowns, inching towards the door. ""Come on, tell me,"" he says. Falling hopelessly and madly in love, she thinks, and hurries out of the room before she does something stupid like say it out loud. He's getting better. She's not sure how, but that's what the doctors say, and they seem to understand these things far more than she ever could. It's a shift in brain chemistry, or something. The latest brain scan shows active regions that were previously dormant. At first, they were seeing spikes in activity associated with addiction and obsession, triggered from the tracker jacker venom they assumed, but even after his system was cleansed, the striatum persisted to light up in all of his scans. Katniss thought that was the problem. That his obsession and paranoia were what impeded his other functions and that was what put a strain on his heart. They show her another scan that is meaningless to her, one they had taken earlier in the day, and they point at it excitedly. ""The ventral tegmental,"" one of the doctors says, tracing his finger up the middle of the image. ""It's associated with calmness and pain management, and when we show him images and videos that once excited the striatum, now the activity has shifted to here."" She nods as if she understands, and the doctor continues when she doesn't speak. ""Past research indicates this sort of activity is associated with romantic love."" Her eyes widen. Peeta still loves her. She goes into the forest that afternoon collecting berries, plants, and flowers, which she grinds into different pastes and smears against a flat plank of wood. When she's content with the pallet, she returns to Thirteen, stopping in one of the supply closets to grab a can of white paint, before returning to Peeta's compartment. She extends the plank and can of paint, smiling weakly. ""Not as fancy as the stuff they used to send you from the Capitol, but hopefully it's a step up from the pencils."" His wide grin makes her stomach knot, and when he asks if she'd like to sit with him for a while, she nods a bit too eagerly. He doesn't have a paintbrush, so he uses his fingers, and she watches intently as he dips his finger into each dye, swirling it into a puddle of white paint until a new, brilliant color is formed. When he's finished, he presents it to her, and the sight makes her heart stand still. It's of their picnic, before the games, on the training center roof when they watched the sunset for the last time. Every detail is captured vividly from the crown of flowers to the color of her dress. But what's most magnificent is the sky, which captures the harsh, mysterious darkness of night and the gentle light of day, separated by a beautiful, warm band of orange. It's you,"" she says, her hand hovering over the image, too delicate to touch. ""What?"" ""Peeta,"" she says, cupping his round face in her hands. ""It's you."" She kisses him. Soft, tender, unlike any kiss they've shared before, and when he returns it, it's not the constant steadiness of their staged kisses, or the primal lust that consumed him after the hijacking, it's passionate and sturdy. It's Peeta. When they pull apart, gasping for breath, she sees his pupils as they widen and contract wildly between pinpoints and saucers. His grip on her tightens, anchoring him to reality. ""Katniss,"" he says, his voice strained. ""You stayed."" ""Always,"" she replies."

When he reached her doorstep, he hadn't the courage to knock, so he left it on the welcome mat. He couldn't help it though, and paused as he left, catching sight of her, peering out at him through the curtains. ""I've noticed you since that day,"" she said. ""How your favorite color is orange. The way you double knot your shoelaces. How you never add sugar to your iced tea, even though it isn't sweetened. And then when we got older, I just assumed you hated me. You were always teasing me, and then you were off with Delly and Glimmer, and I hated it. It's stupid, I don't know what I was thinking,"" she said, shaking her head as she moved to stand. Peeta didn't let her though, and he caught her in his arms, turning her so that he could kiss her again. His fingers unraveling what was left of her braid so that her hair fell in loose waves around her shoulders. He wanted to be consumed by her, to find and savor every part of her. His hands moved quickly and with urgency, everywhere and nowhere all at once. He palmed her breast until she gasped into his mouth. Down her flat abdomen. Stroked the length of her sun kissed thigh, waiting for her to open her legs to him. She watched him with dark, hooded eyes, while her bottom lip worried between her teeth. ""Can I?"" he asked, and her legs eased apart to grant him access. He rubbed his fingers against her, working up a rhythm before he pressed his palm flat against her through her jean shorts. She lifted her hips to meet his touch, and he used his thumb to draw lazy circles around where he knew to be most sensitive. She whimpered, her legs opening wider to him and he pressed harder and with increasing speed. A satisfied grin tilting his lips as he watched her tremble beneath his touch. He knew he was limited through the barrier of clothing, and moved to unbutton her shorts, pausing to look up at her with hesitant eyes before she gave him an approving nod. Removing her shorts and underwear, he discarded them on the floor beside the sofa, leaving Katniss nearly naked beneath him. The implications seemed to hit her as his eyes admired her perfect form. Katniss was never one to be vulnerable, and to her, this type of exposure was the epitome of vulnerability. And in Katniss's way, she closed her thighs together tightly, and rolled to bury her face in the pillow beside her. Peeta rested his chin on the tops of her knees. ""We can stop,"" he said, running his gentle fingertips along her calves. ""No,"" she said abruptly, looking at him from behind the pillow. ""Just... just give me a minute."" He kissed the top of her knee. ""You're so beautiful,"" he whispered against her skin. She calmed to his words, and her legs slackened, gradually opening to him. His eyes never left hers, dark blue drowning in a sea of lustful gray, as he hooked one knee over his shoulder, and drew himself back to settle between her thighs. He dragged his lips along the smooth skin, working from where her leg touched his shoulder until he met the apex. Her entire body tensed with anticipation, and he could hear her breath hitch in her throat when his mouth came within a breath of her entrance. Katniss bucked her hips forward, begging for his touch, but he turned his face away abruptly to tend to her other leg. ""Peeta,"" she warned, her voice strangled as she reached out to tangle her fingers in his sloppy blond curls. He grazed his teeth against her sensitive flesh, and looked up at her innocently. ""Is there a problem."" ""Peeta,"" she said again with a sense of urgency, and it was the sexiest thing he had ever heard. ""Where was I?"" he said huskily. He flicked his tongue over her clit, causing her entire body to shudder. He licked her again, gauging her reaction before teasing her with light nips, grinning against her when he felt her fingers scrape against his scalp. He hitched her leg higher over his shoulder so that her hips were tipped towards him and devoured her eagerly, lifting his dark eyes to watch her as his tongue made her quiver. He felt her thighs tighten around him, knew she was getting close, and he dipped a finger inside of her, then two, feeling her walls clench around him with each thrust. Her body arched from the sofa to meet him when he pressed his tongue flat against her sensitive bundle of nerves, and with his other hand he reached up to grab her breast roughly, rolling her tightened nipple between his thumb and forefinger until the rolling of her hips subsided and she collapsed against the cushions with an uninhibited cry. Her release crashed through him as well, and he brought her back down with slow easy strokes until her breathing became even. ""How was that?"" he asked, placing a kiss on her inner thigh. She threw back her head and grinned. ""It was nice,"" she said, and she let out an exhausted, satiated sigh. He bit her gently. ""Nice?"" he said incredulously. ""Nicer than kissing,"" she agreed. ""I'd hope to leave you with the impression of slightly more than nice,"" he said. He kissed her hip, then belly button, working up the fabric of her tank top until he was settled between her breasts. \Okay,"" she said, her voice cut off by the gasp she let out when his mouth found one of her soft peaks. ""Then you'll allow it?"" he murmured against her skin. She wrapped her legs around the back of his thighs and urged him against her. ""I'll allow it,"" she said."

She leaned into his chest and allowed her eyes to flutter shut, just long enough for images of Marvel and Glimmer to flash behind her eyelids. Peeta tightened his arms around her, his lips pressing against her forehead, bringing her to ease in an instant. He guided her down the hallway towards her bedroom, and she let him strip her naked. She reveled in the way he touched her, the way he looked at her, like he couldn't see the monster hidden beneath the surface. He kissed along invisible scars, leaving the skin beneath it clean. ""You felling better?"" he asked when his hand slipped between her legs. She bit her lip and nodded furiously, moaning when he pushed into her. She lifted her hips to meet his thrusts when he picked up speed. Her only thought was of the delicious friction from where they were joined. When she closed her eyes now, she only saw fireworks. Peeta fell asleep shortly after, but Katniss still felt wired. She checked her phone to find that Haymitch had messaged her again, and remembered the ominous text he had sent earlier. Checking to make sure that Peeta was still sleeping, she padded down the hall and dialed Haymitch's number. ""You rang?"" she said. ""I did,"" he said. ""A couple times actually."" She scoffed. ""I was busy."" ""I bet,"" Haymitch said. ""You want the good news or the bad news first?"" ""Let's start out on a good note. I'll take the bad,"" she said, checking over her shoulder to ensure Peeta hadn't followed her. ""We have some competition."" ""Some kids clear the pharmacy of pseudoephedrine?"" she said dryly. ""They're calling him the Baker,"" he said and he didn't sound amused. ""He's making orange glass. Looks just like yours."" She rolled her eyes. ""Sounds like a cheap imitation. Snow knows what he's getting with our product."" ""It's 100% pure."" That didn't make sense. The only reason why their stuff was red was because of an impurity in their process. Haymitch had tested the clarity once and it was somewhere around 97%. ""Then why is it orange?"" ""Because we've got some competition,"" he repeated. ""He's dyeing it on purpose."" Fine. They couldn't expect total domination of the Panem market forever. They'd have to get creative. ""The good news then?"" ""This Baker isn't the only new friend joining the party,"" Haymitch said. She sighed heavily and pressed her palm against her forehead. ""What color is there's?"" ""I don't know. What color is the DEA wearing these days?"" Her eyes widened. They were in trouble now. ""There's an agent on us?"" she tried not to shout. She was struck with an idea and smiled wickedly. ""You going to stick him on our new friend?"" ""If I can swing it."" ""Got any leads on him?"" ""That's where the good news comes in,"" and she could hear him chuckle. ""Check your messages, sweetheart. He's cute,"" he said, his voice uncharacteristically playful. Katniss opened her e-mail and downloaded the attachment Haymitch had sent, nearly dropping her phone at the image staring back at her. Peeta Mellark, Special Agent A DEA agent. She had nearly a pound of crystal meth in her jacket and a DEA agent sleeping in her bed. She looked up the hallway towards her darkened bedroom door. It was eerily silent, even with the blood rushing through her ears. She had to get rid of the drugs. She had to get rid of him. His coat was thrown over hers on the dining room chair and when she tossed it aside, something slipped from his pocket. His badge. And something else. She picked up the small dime bag, holding it up to the light to find a packet of perfectly clear, orange crystals. ""Katniss?"" She could hear his footsteps moving down the hallway, his voice still tired with sleep. She began to panic, diving towards the bread drawer where her gun was hidden. Peeta stood at the edge of the room. His eyes landed on the drugs on the table and then at the gun pointed at him. ""What's going on?"" ""Who are you?"" she demanded. ""Katniss,"" he said calmly. ""Put the gun down."" "" Who are you? "" He picked up the bag of Firecracker to inspect it. ""Where did you get this?"" She shifted her weight from foot to foot, her throat too dry to speak. ""You selling it?"" There was way too much to pass as a user. She tried to nod but couldn't. ""Did you make this?"" he asked, his eyes widening. ""You don't get to ask the questions,"" she said, flicking the safety and clicking a bullet into the chamber. He laughed and shook his head in disbelief. ""You're the fire girl, aren't you?"" He dropped the bag onto the table. ""Shit."" ""What about you?"" she said. She waved the gun at him, urging him to meet her eye, which he did easily. He wasn't afraid of her at all, and it was driving her crazy. ""Are you DEA? Or are you the Baker?"" ""The Baker?"" he chuckled. ""About time."" He pinched the dime bag of orange crystals and held it up to the light. ""Pretty good, huh? I don't get why they call it cooking. It's a chemical reaction. That's baking, right?"" She didn't answer. ""No offense, but you're stuff –?"" He pointed to the firecracker. ""That? It's pretty amateur."" ""That batch was a dud,"" she said flatly. ""Oh, no, I've seen it plenty. Pehnylacetone reduction, right?"" She hesitated to nod. ""You're cooking too hot. You could have saved this."" She narrowed her eyes. ""What are you doing?"" ""Giving you some tips."" ""Why?"" ""I want you to work for me."" He took a few tentative steps towards her to make sure she wouldn't shoot. ""I can help you, Katniss."" Her finger quivered over the trigger. One squeeze and all her current problems would be solved. ""How?"""

He could taste Chapstick and peppermint on the tip of his tongue. He turned away. ""I don't think it's right, what we've been doing,"" he said, staring at his hands folded in his lap. ""We've kissed twice now, once at that party and then earlier today, and all the while you're on your way to see him?"" ""Him?"" she said, her eyebrows shooting up. ""Your boyfriend,"" Peeta said dumbly. She shook her head, letting out a laugh that sounded indignant. ""I don't have a boyfriend."" ""Then who are you trying to surprise?"" She blinked a few times, still caught off guard by his accusation. ""My sister,"" she said as if it were obvious. ""I didn't get to see her at Thanksgiving."" Peeta felt like an idiot. He had completely forgotten about her little sister, Prim. She was four years behind them, and still in middle school when they graduated. ""Oh,"" he said slowly. ""So you and Gale aren't –?"" She laughed, louder this time. ""Gale? What? No! He's like my cousin!"" Peeta felt like an even bigger idiot now. He shook his head, still not ready to believe her. ""But in high school, you were together all the time,"" he said. ""We were friends,"" she argued. ""I never liked him that way."" She shrugged her shoulder a lowered her voice to a mumble. ""I liked someone else."" ""Who?"" She cringed. ""You?"" she said. Peeta nearly fell out of the bed at her confession, his eyebrows lifting, encouraging for her to continue. ""I'd be lying if I said I thought about you often,"" she said, her face flushing around her cheeks. ""But you looked kind of cute in your wrestling uniform."" She covered her face with her hands. ""Oh god, that sounds awful."" ""No it doesn't,"" he said quickly. ""And then I saw you at that party last week. I knew you went to USC too, but it was the first time we'd run into each other, and I don't know. I guess they call it liquid courage for a reason."" ""Katniss?"" She turned her head to look at him, a smile ghosting her lips. ""Yeah?"" By default, when it came to words, Peeta always knew the right ones at the right time. He was captain of the debate team in school, and he had served on the student council every year in high school. But in this moment, he knew he didn't have to talk. For once, Katniss had done it for him. Instead he kissed her. It was different than the ones before. It wasn't sloppy from the alcohol or hesitant, like the comfort she had offered him earlier that day. This one was something else. The hungry kind, where kissing didn't seem like enough. The kind where bodies deliberately moved and twisted to lay flush. And where soft, approving hums grew into something less abandoned. He pinned her beneath him. His mouth moved to cover her jaw then her neck. His hand smoothing over her ribcage to squeeze her breast in his palm. She bowed off the mattress in response to connect their bodies where they didn't already meet, singing her approval when he slipped his hand beneath her shirt. Her nipples were already pebbled into tightened peaks, which he pinched between his thumb and forefinger, grunting when her hips rocked against his in response. He rolled onto his side slightly to rest his weight on one arm and used the other hand to trail down her abdomen, then dipping his fingers between her legs. His breath hitched when pressed his fingers against her heated center. Even through her flannel pajama bottoms, he could feel how wet she was. ""Jesus,"" he murmured into the crook of her neck. She gripped his shoulder tightly, her breaths coming in short pants. ""Do you have a condom?"" she whispered in his ear. He groaned, loudly. The weight he had been holding on his arm collapsed as he rolled onto the empty space of the bed beside of her. ""No,"" he said. His head hit the pillow, hard, and he stared up at the ceiling with a petulant sigh. He didn't even have one in his wallet, which he knew was a bad place to keep one anyway, but he couldn't help it. He really wanted to have sex with her. Then he remembered it. The oddly placed merchandise on the bottom row. The vending machine. ""I do,"" he said, jumping off the bed and gathering some change. He adjusted himself beneath the waistband of his boxer shorts, and rushed to the machine, plopping coins in with shaking fingers until he had enough for the condom on the bottom row. Peeta wasn't the most experienced, admittedly. He'd only had sex a handful of times, and each time the girl didn't act like it was anything amazing. It hadn't shattered his confidence and he didn't necessarily think he was bad, he just really liked Katniss, and he really wanted to impress her. His wrist began to cramp, moving his fingers in tight circles between her legs, but he refused to stop until her toes curled into the sheets and her back arched from the mattress. And then, when he was inside her, he closed his eyes and willed himself to relax, fighting the tightness in his cock, refusing to release his orgasm before her walls to clenched around him. After, when they lay tangled and boneless, he struggled to catch his breath. Although she hadn't been overly vocal, she had seemed pleased enough, yet he found himself feeling anxious over her response. He hid his face in her hair, unable to look at her. But then she kissed him. And when she asked, ""Do you have anymore?"" Peeta ran into the snow barefoot, wearing only a pair of boxer shorts and carrying a handful of quarters to empty the vending machine."

His hands grip my hips, pinning me to the counter, and he hitches my leg high around his waist to cradle himself between my thighs. I gasp when I feel him hardening against my center. ""We should stop,"" I say weakly, before things go too far. ""We should,"" he agrees, but then I'm sitting on the counter and he's tipping my head to the side to drag his lips against my throat. His hand moves to massage my breast through the thin silk robe, and I moan when he rolls my hardened nipple between his fingers. My mind is a mess, unable to escape the delicious feel of his lips on my neck, and the place where our bodies connect when he thrusts between my legs. ""I'm not myself,"" I manage to say between heavy breaths. He unties the belt holding my robe closed and pushes it open. My body keens, back arching, when his fingers dip into my underwear. ""We're going to be okay,"" he says. I don't understand what he means, but I don't stop him when he peels my underwear down my legs, or when he drops his trousers and undershorts. I open my legs eagerly when he pushes into me, letting out a cry as he stretches and fills me completely. His thrusts are frantic and I reach for the cabinet behind my head to anchor myself in place. My legs tighten around him to drive him deeper, but the position ins't right. I struggle to angle my hips, and sensing this, he lifts me from the counter, spinning clumsily to push my back against the cool, steel refrigerator door. ""Fuck,"" he growls, his thrusts pushing me higher and higher up the door. His mouth finds my breast and he lavishes it through the thin cotton of my under clothes. His teeth tightening around my nipple until I scream. I can feel his cock pulse as he empties inside me, and my walls instinctively tighten to coax his orgasm. He lowers me so my feet touch the ground, and I grasp his broad shoulders to keep my knees from buckling. ""Sorry, I got a bit carried away,"" he says sheepishly, withdrawing his softening cock. My legs are still trembling, and I can feel the aftereffects dripping down my thigh. We didn't use protection. ""It's okay,"" I say. ""I'll take something in the morning."" ""What?"" he says, his eyes dark, lids heavy, as he looks into mine imploringly. Before I can answer there's a heavy knock on the door. He groans, pulling up his pants and buckling his belt before he answers. ""Peeta Mellark?"" the man on the other side of the door says. ""Peeta,"" I test the name on my tongue, committing it to memory. ""That's me,"" he says tiredly. ""We have some questions about Marlene Childs."" He opens the door wide, revealing a detective flanked by two Peacekeepers. ""Can you ask her yourself?"" The detective looks surprised to see me, as if he's looking at a ghost. He must have come from the scene. He clears his throat to speak. ""I'm Detective Crane,"" he says acknowledging me and then Peeta quickly. ""Do you have your PIC, ma'am?"" I nod shortly, wrapping my robe tightly around me as I slip into the bedroom. I pick up the satchel to retrieve Marlene's PIC, the emblem flashes yellow. Under investigation. I eye the window, wondering if I can make a quick escape, but the pane is sealed. It doesn't matter anyway, I came here to prove that Katniss Everdeen was dead. This was the way to put that final nail in the coffin. I return to the kitchen, extending Marlene's PIC to the detective. He looks at the picture then back at my face. ""Run a retina,"" he tells one of the Peacekeepers beside him. My spine tenses and I catch myself on the counter top before I can fall. We may share the same face, but I don't know where the similarities end. Certainly our retina scans won't match. ""What's the problem?"" Peeta steps in. ""We've got Visas, we're allowed to be here. You can look at them if you'd like."" ""It's not that,"" Crane says. He holds the retina scanner to my eye and it beeps before I can blink or look away. He stares at the display, his frown deepening. ""Looks like a case of mistaken identity,"" he says, still reading the screen. He pushes the scanner back into the Peacekeepers hands. ""Reset her PIC, will you?"" He swipes my ID through a scanner and when he returns it, the emblem flashes blue again. ""Sorry to bother you, Miss Childs,"" he says, then walks briskly towards the door. ""Wait,"" Peeta chases after them. ""Not until you explain what's going on. You can't just burst in here, in the middle of the night. We have rights, you know."" ""Peeta, let it go,"" I say, grabbing onto his hand. Crane and the Peacekeepers close the door behind them, leaving us alone. Peeta turns to me, his eyes wild and angry. It's obvious he won't calm down until he has answers, and the truth certainly isn't a possibility ""It was a drug test,"" I lie. ""They told me this would happen."" ""Through a retina?"" I nod somberly, even though the idea is ridiculous. ""I passed."" I squeeze his hand. ""I told you, I'm getting better. It's okay for you to go home. It'll be good for you."" He studies me carefully. ""We'll talk about it in the morning,"" he says, his hand slipping from mine as he heads to the bedroom. I stand in the kitchen, flipping Marlene's PIC in my hands. If I want to pull this off, I need Peeta out of the way. I look at Marlene's picture, the question I don't want the answer to, still gnawing at the back of my mind.

Madge and Delly had talked her into doing happy hours on Thursdays. A good ole fashion ""girl's night."" Sometimes there was karaoke, which although Katniss acted surly about, she secretly enjoyed. ""Ugh, I know,"" Madge chirped in. ""They get to claim any sort of dwelling space as their 'cave' but the second your clothes drift past the halfway marker in the closet, you're the one taking up too much space. Patriarchy. When will they learn?"" She picked up the pitcher to refill everyone's glass. ""I'm so envious of you Katniss. You don't have to deal with the bullshit."" She flushed. ""Having my mother as a roommate?"" she said flatly. Their waiter appeared and placed a shot in front of Katniss. ""Compliments of the guy over there,"" he said. Katniss ducked her face behind her hand, feeling mortified. ""He's kind of cute,"" Madge offered, checking over her shoulder to appraise him. He was. He looked young though, maybe 21 - probably only 19 with a good enough fake. She forced herself to smile, but before she could find the gentlest way out of the situation, Delly was waving the drink away. ""Hello! Sorry!"" she shouted across the bar at the guy with his friends. ""She already has a boyfriend."" The guy took it easily enough, but now Katniss felt worse. Her eyes locked with Madge who had lifted a questioning eyebrow. Katniss shook her head, perplexed. ""Boyfriend, huh?"" Madge teased. ""Peeta?"" Delly stated obviously. ""Is that what the kids are calling it these days?"" Madge said. ""He's crazy about you,"" Delly said, taking Katniss's hand to squeeze it. ""He's always been so crazy about you. It's so exciting to see you two get your chance. We should have a dinner thing - all six of us. It'll be fun!"" Blood began to rush to Katniss's ears, drowning out the sound of Delly's voice. He's crazy about you. ""Why'd you get divorced?"" Peeta tapped his playing piece against each square on the board until he counted out the spaces for his turn. He drew a card from the deck and grimaced. ""This isn't much fun. Monopoly really is a terrible game,"" he said, counting out a few paper bills and handing them to her. She couldn't tell if he was avoiding the question or if he hadn't heard. ""What happened? Did she cheat on you?"" He lifted his eyebrows and looked slightly perplexed. ""No."" She felt something heavy in the pit of her stomach. She pinched one of the little red houses between her fingers, rolling it against the pad of her thumb before she dropped it on the board. She looked at him, and then away. ""Did you cheat on her?"" ""What? No!"" he sounded exasperated, but he laughed it off easy enough. ""It isn't always so melodramatic."" ""I just figured..."" He shuffled his remaining money and tucked it beneath the edge of the board. ""Why didn't you marry Gale?"" ""We weren't happy,"" she said with a shrug. ""Neither were we."" Katniss was done playing the game. She pulled herself onto the couch and hugged her knees to her chest. She'd spent so much time in this basement now, it was easy to make herself at home. They'd been sleeping together for three months now. ""What's wrong with us?"" she said. ""How'd we fuck it up so bad?"" He sat beside her. ""You work hard, you do what you're told, and everything's supposed to work out. Then what are we doing here?"" ""We settled,"" he said. That sounded like a good way to put it. He dropped his arm around her shoulders and sighed. ""I remember when I was a kid, I thought that when I found 'the one' I'd just know. And there was this girl - the first time I saw her I was five years old, and she was it for me. That's what love was."" ""What happened to her?"" He looked at her knowingly. ""I had these feelings, but I never knew what to do with them. I figured there were more people out there for me like that and that I'd find them too. But nobody held a candle to her, and I realized that I must have built up this fantasy that wasn't real. So I had to figure it out all over again, but it was never the same."" Katniss felt the same way after her sister died. That a part of her had died too, and she'd never get that back. She'd been living in neutral since then. ""I think it's important,"" he continued. ""Knowing when there's a difference. Knowing when it's right. And not wasting your time on anything else."" She frowned. ""What are we doing then?"" ""I don't know,"" he said. ""I want to find out though."" She nodded. ""Me too."" Katniss took the pile of folded laundry and tucked it into the dresser drawer. It didn't quite fit so she spread a few shirts to another stack, pausing when she felt something rigid beneath the fabric. She dug deeper to uncover a small felt box. A ring. She and Peeta had been together for over a year now, and they'd shared this apartment for eight months. Marriage was only a conversation they'd had in passing, but it was a direction they were heading towards. Katniss snapped the box shut. She hadn't realized that they were already there. She padded into the living room where he was watching television. Stepping beside him, she dropped the box into his lap. The color drained from his face as understanding filled it. ""I can explain,"" he said quickly. She cut him off. ""I want to,"" she said. ""You want to marry me?"" he said with wide eyes. She dropped to her knees before him to kiss him through her smile.

""How do I measure up?"" she said, watching him tentatively. He covered one with his palm and gave it a gentle squeeze. ""Not quite as big,"" he said. ""But these are much better."" He flicked his tongue over the pebbled peak, and she shuddered, her back bowing off the bed to meet his touch. ""These are real."" ""You dreamed I had fake tits?"" He nipped her playfully and she let out a yelp. ""You know what I meant,"" he said flatly. He laughed, dropping his face to her shoulder, while his hand continued to massage her breast in his palm. ""I'm talking so much. God, I must be so annoying."" ""No. I like it."" He looked up at her, his eyelashes fluttering shyly against her skin. ""The least I can do is talk dirty or something. What's sexier? Pussy or precious garden?"" ""Really?"" She scoffed. ""I'm trying to figure out what sort of imagery I should use. It has to work well with my 'magnificent cock'."" She lifted her eyebrows. ""That sounds like an overstatement."" ""You haven't seen it yet."" He rolled his hips, agonizingly slow, so that the entire length of his erection rubbed against her center. Her throat felt dry and she pressed her lips together tightly to suppress the hitch in her breath. ""Okay. No more talking."" He moved up her body, his lips touching her throat, then right beneath her earlobe. ""I want to be inside you,"" he said in a heady whisper. She whimpered, and nodded her head frantically. ""All right. I'll allow that,"" she said. He sat back on his knees to unfasten her jeans, and she lifted her hips to accommodate him as he stripped them from her legs. With her feet planted on the mattress, he ran his fingers up the back of her calves to the crook of her knee. She hadn't shaved in a few days, a fact she was now dreadfully aware of, but he didn't notice, or at least, he didn't seem to care. He opened her legs wide, stroking her inner thigh to the apex, pausing when he reached the edge of her underwear. He traced her opening with his thumb through the cotton, a pleased smile slanting his mouth. She was already wet for him. He tugged on the elastic waistband, his eyes searching hers for approval, which seemed silly, since she was already practically naked. But then she was naked, and he was hovering above her with his hand trapped between their bodies, and his fingers pressed against her clit. Her hips moved to the rhythm of his ministrations, lifting eagerly when his pace quickened. He kissed her when she began to fall apart. His tongue stroking against hers deliberately as he dipped his fingers inside her, gathering more moisture to take her over the edge. When she came, he swallowed her cries in his kiss, leaving her boneless and breathless in its wake. ""There are condoms in the dresser. Top drawer,"" she said, her eyelids still heavy in the aftermath. He brought the entire box back, tearing off a packet and dropping the rest on the floor beside the bed. He unfastened his belt and kicked off his jeans and boxer shorts. She took this moment to admire him, her gaze settling on his erection. ""Fine, I may have embellished a bit,"" he said, when he caught her staring. But he hadn't. He was perfect. He rolled on the condom and sat beside her, ready to position himself above her again. She stopped him though, pressing her hand against his chest so she could swing her leg over his and straddle his hips. ""You're killing me,"" he groaned as she sank down his length. She balanced her hands on his stomach, lifting herself on her knees and lowering herself again and again until she was used to his girth, the lustful gaze in his eyes spurring her on more and more. His hands skimmed beneath her rib cage then he took her breast in each hand, massaging the mounds and working the tough peaks between his fingers. ""You would not believe how jealous all the younger versions of me are right now."" When she leaned forward, using the rungs from her headboard as support, she found the perfect angle to stimulate her clitoris against his pelvic bone, and she rolled her hips with growing fervor. Then his thumb was there too, fingers splayed against her abdomen to anchor it in place while he circled her clit deftly. His other hand gripped her thigh, holding her steady so he could meet his thrusts. She came with a shout and him soon after, her walls clenching to coax his ebbing orgasm. She collapsed against his hard chest, and they both lay there, still tangled, until their shallow breaths became even. He lifted her mess of hair off her shoulder and combed his fingers through it to loosen the tangles and smooth the strands down her back. He was still inside her and her walls fluttered every time she felt his cock pulse faintly. ""Three hours isn't that long,"" he said quietly. ""I was driving pretty slow too — to get here — I could probably make it in two if I tried."" Katniss bit her lip to contain how please she was as he mused over the logistics of seeing her. ""I don't think I could wait three months to see you again,"" he told her, his fingers running absently up and down her sides. ""In fact I really am ready to run down and register for classes so I never have to leave."" She thought she'd be more terrified by the idea, but she wasn't. ""I'd grow awful tired of having you around."" He kissed her again. ""I'd be more than happy to test that theory."" She smiled at him. ""Me too,"" she said. Find me on tumblr ( absnow )"

It's soft, and tender, and loving, oh so loving. She wants to protect him. To scare away his daemons, and when she feels his mouth open to hers, she thinks that maybe she can. Things get serious pretty quickly. Katniss joins the Mellarks for Thanksgiving dinner, and for Christmas Peeta gives her a gold locket after having dinner with her family. She thinks she may marry him, but she never says those types of things out loud. Her mother works on New Years Eve, and Prim rather spend it with her friends, leaving Katniss with the house to herself. She lights a cliched number of candles and sneaks a bottle of champagne from the cellar, reasoning that she's twenty years old and allowed a taste of rebellion every now and then. Peeta laughs at her when he sees the set up. ""If I didn't know any better, I'd say you were trying to seduce me,"" he teases. She's already had a glass of champagne – and she had drank it quickly to help soothe her nerves, so she giggles and speaks a bit more brazenly than usual. ""Maybe I am,"" she says. He still uses his cane, but doesn't rely on it nearly as much as he used to. He discards it by the door in a swift motion and quickly wraps his arms around her so that she's pressed tightly against him. They kiss like this often. An overwhelming passion that she can't help but get lost in. But the focus is always on her, and on the rare occasion that he allows for her to reciprocate, he only unbuttons his pants and pushes them as far down his hips as necessary. She worries that he's ashamed, wishes for a way to show him that she loves every part of him. She guides him towards the couch and he slumps down gracelessly in the middle of the plush cushions, opening his arms to her eagerly in anticipation. Instead she drops to her knees before him, and a wicked grin crosses his lips, but falters when she reaches for his shoelaces rather than the target he was hoping for. She removes his right sneaker first, to reveal a white socked foot, and then the left sneaker, which slips off easily over the metal flipper. His breath catches when she sits up to unbutton his slacks. ""Katniss,"" he warns, his voice tight and nearly trembling, but he lifts his hips anyway when she begins to tug them down. She's worked them to his knees when he frantically covers her hands with his to still her. ""Please,"" he says. ""I don't want you to see me this way."" His face is close enough to kiss him, and she does, until his hands slacken above hers and his pants are pooled around his ankles. There's a strap that clamps around his thigh to hold the saddle of his prosthetic in place, and she unfastens it with trembling fingers, knowing that he is watching her with bated breath. It doesn't budge when she goes to remove it, and she's startled when his hands again cover hers. ""Let me,"" he says. He tips it gently upward to release the suctioned air and carefully pulls the false leg from the natural remaining part of his thigh. Before he'd gotten his prosthetic, she'd only seen him in sweatpants or slacks with the pant leg pinned. It doesn't look any different than she imagined it would. His leg starts at his hip like any other leg, extends to his thigh and then just stops. The skin is shiny and puckered around the stump, and she runs her fingers over the smooth, taught scars. ""Does it hurt?"" she asks when he flinches. ""It gets sore, yes, if I wear the fake one for too long,"" he says. ""It mostly tickles right now."" She leans forward to pepper light kisses along his leg and he chuckles nervously. ""Do you want me to stop?"" she asks. ""No, keep going,"" he says tightly. ""What are you thinking about?"" she says right before her tongue darts out to trace along his scars. His skin is salty and faintly metallic tasting from the prosthetic. ""That if I knew it would get me the girl of my dreams, I would have lost my leg a long time ago,"" he says. ""Stop it,"" she says, and smacks him playfully. ""I mean it,"" he says, and his tone is so earnest that it throws her off guard. ""When I got back from the Gulf, everyone treated me like I was this broken thing. I felt like a chore. But then at the party, when everyone was fussing all over me, I saw you, and you smiled at me, and I don't know,"" he frowns and bows his head. ""I didn't feel so broken anymore."" He lifts her chin with his hand and leans forward so that their noses are nearly touching. ""Even before that Katniss. Back in high school when you barely even noticed me."" ""That's not true,"" she says with a sense of urgency. He shakes his head. ""Whenever I caught your eye,"" he continues, ""I don't know. I just had the feeling that you understood me."" ""Why don't you paint anymore?"" she asks suddenly, as if it's a question that has been burdening her. He grins and kisses her firmly. ""I like you, Katniss,"" he says, just as he did the first time he came to see her. ""In fact, I like you so much, I think I'm in love with you."" She climbs into his lap to kiss him thoroughly. ""I love you too,"" she says. She doesn't think she'll marry Peeta Mellark anymore, because she knows that she will. And on the day that he asks her, six months later, she doesn't have to respond, she only has to smile."

The rush leads to a dull throb between my legs, which is becoming increasingly impossible to ignore, no matter how I shift my hips. ""How does it feel?"" he says. There's an edge to his voice now, and when I make out the outline of his smile in the dim light, it looks pleased. ""I really like kissing you,"" I say lazily. ""Me too."" He gives me another kiss. But the spell doesn't last much longer. Peeta comes to his senses, sitting back on his heels to distance himself. ""This isn't right. We shouldn't do this."" ""We're getting married,"" I remind him. ""We'll have to. They'll want children."" ""Hopefully it won't come to that,"" he says, scrubbing a hand over his face. ""They're going to take it away from us. Why can't we have it now? When it's still our choice."" He's not convinced. ""You want this? This isn't a game?"" he says. I'll never be able to erase the doubt Peeta feels. A small part will always feel it myself. But things have changed between us since the Games. Since the Victory Tour, and the days waiting for my injury to heal. My feelings for Peeta have evolved into something entirely different. Something I'm too terrified to identify right now. I need for him to keep on kissing me. I liked it better that way. ""What do you want Katniss?"" My body is so tightly wound, I can't stand it a moment longer. ""I need you - I want you to..."" ""To what? Tell me."" I reach for his hand and touch it to my cheek, but I don't just want it there, I want it everywhere. I guide it down my neck, then across my collar bone. The darkness in his gaze emboldens me, and I smooth his palm over one of my breast. He takes control, curling his fingers around the mound and squeezing it with his hand. When his thumb flicks over my tightened nipple, I let out an embarrassing sound between a moan and a yelp. He does it again, grinning when he elicits a similar response. ""What about now?"" he says, toying with the top button that keeps the front of my dress closed. I nod eagerly and he unfastens it deftly, then circles the one below it, freeing each button until my dress falls open. I'm basically only in my underclothes now, but with all my prep team has seen, I'm far beyond any kind of modesty. My skin burns where his fingers splay across my waist and when he bows his head to nip at my breast through the thin, cotton bra I almost sing. It all feels wonderful, but nothing has addressed the ache between my legs. A damp heat gathers, pooling every time he finds new skin to lavish until I feel like I'm dripping. I urge his hands lower, to my hips, hoping he'll take the hint. He kisses down my stomach, pausing below my belly button. My breath hitches when he kisses me over my underwear. His groan is muffled against my hipbone. ""You're really wet, Katniss,"" he says, and by the grin that slants his mouth, I take this as an endearment. He removes my underwear then spreads my legs wide. ""Do you want me to?"" My eyes widen when his lips touch the inside of my thigh, his mouth dangerously close to my center. I nod wordlessly, my entire body clenching in anticipation. The feeling of his tongue is an odd sensation at first, but when he presses it flat against the cleft, I see fireworks behind my eyelids. I can't believe such a small bundle of nerves can ignite every fiber of my being, but I'm floating now, anchored only by his hands pinning my hips to the cushion. My toes curl and I cry out, the pleasure of his tongue silencing my protesting heel. I need to hold onto something desperately. My fingernails scrape against the upholstery, then up my body to my hair, where I fist the tresses, ravishing it from my braid. It's hard to keep my eyes open, the warmth coursing through my veins leaves my lids impossibly heavy. Through the faint haze I can make out his eyes staring up at me, the embers from the fireplace reflecting in his blackened irises. It's that image that makes my body keen. The all consuming hunger crests, and I dissolve against the sofa, sated and full. He presses his forehead against my belly, his lips slick against my stomach. ""I should take you home,"" he says. I can't quite make out his tone, but I fear regret. He stands and moves to the window. ""It stopped snowing. I'm going to shovel the walkway so I can carry you back."" I find my underwear and button my dress, feeling surprisingly numb when moments ago I was humming with something wonderful. I curl into a ball on the sofa, staring directly into the flames. Outside, I can hear the sharp sound of the steel shovel breaking through the ice. I can't recall the exact moment I fall asleep, but when I open my eyes, sunlight is creeping through the window. My bedroom window. My bed feels cold and empty. I reach my fingers across the mattress in search of Peeta, but it quickly becomes obvious that he isn't there. I make myself stand, limping to the window to let in the chill. The cold is welcome, and I inhale a deep breath, reveling the burn in my lungs. Across the lawn I hear the familiar crunch of snow, then I see him, Peeta, with his sketchbook tucked under his arm, making his way up the cobblestone path that leads to my front door. ""You making a jailbreak again?"" he calls up to me. I smile. ""That depends. Are you going to catch me?"" Find me on tumblr at absnow ."

""Decided to stay in tonight too?"" he says, and smiles warmly at her, as if she hadn't made a complete fool of herself hours before. ""Yeah,"" she says shyly. He walks down the hall a few steps and pauses outside of the lounge. ""Want the next game?"" he says and nods towards the pool table. She hesitates. ""Sure,"" she says, surprised when the word tumbles out of her mouth. He racks a game of Nine-ball and breaks when Katniss declines. The three ball goes in, so he lines up the shot for the one ball. He's not very good though, and the ball is deflected against a wall and away from any of the pockets. Katniss takes her turn, aligning the one ball with the nine, ending the game with a single stroke. ""Well that was fun,"" he says dryly. ""Sorry."" ""I was kind of hoping you'd be bad,"" he admits, bouncing the cue ball against the far wall of the table. ""And you'd let me teach you."" ""Oh?"" He blushes and shakes his head with a chuckle. ""Wow, that sounded sort of misogynistic, didn't it?"" He pauses, and when his eyes lock with hers they're clouded with a darkness she doesn't recognize. It takes her breath away. ""It's this fantasy I have."" ""How–"" her voice cracks. ""How does it go?"" He licks his lips, causing her stomach to clench. He rounds the pool table and extends his pool cue to her. ""You, uh, you need help lining up your shot."" He guides her to where the cue ball is. She positions the pool stick to take a shot by bending over the edge of the table, her backside connecting with his groin in the process. ""Is this right?"" she says over her shoulder. Peeta's eyes shut tightly and he lets out a groan. Instantly she feels him begin to harden against her, sending a surge of heat straight to her core. She swivels her hips against his experimentally, and he grips her waist to angle her movement over his erection. ""And then I show you this trick,"" he says, and his voice is so low, it sounds like a different person. One hand slides down her arm placed on the table, and the other ghosts up her side and past her breast to her elbow. She shivers against the warmth of his chest, which has swallowed her completely with his body pressed against hers. He aligns her elbow so that it's high, and hangs like a pivot. ""Now shoot straight,"" he murmurs into her ear. She releases the cue and it scratches the table, leaving a blue trail in the felt, but she doesn't care because his lips are hot on her neck, and his arm has wrapped around her waist to massage her breast, and he's thrusting against her and it all feels so deliriously good. ""Is this what you think of, Katniss?"" he says, dipping his hand between her legs where she touched herself for him before. Her elbow buckles and she collapses against the table, biting her lip to keep from screaming. ""Yes,"" she whimpers. He slips his fingers beneath the waistband of her shorts and underwear, and her hips jerk back when she feels his finger sweep between her wet lips. ""What was I doing to you in the shower today?"" he says against her neck just as his finger plunges inside her. ""Th – this."" She shudders when he circles her throbbing clit. He presses more firmly. ""Like this?"" ""Yes,"" she cries. ""Yes."" ""What's another one of your fantasies?"" She turns in his arms to face him and rolls onto her toes to keep in contact with the ministrations of his fingers. Her lips touch his and she kisses him hungrily, her tongue exploring every inch of his mouth. He begins to lift her onto the edge of the pool table, but she stills him, instead slipping his hand from her shorts and dropping to her knees. His jaw is agape, and he braces himself against the table when her hand tentatively touches his tented gym shorts. ""You think about this?"" he says, cheeks flushed and smile sheepish. She licks her lips and nods, then loosens the drawstring of his shorts to lower them down his hips, freeing his hardened cock. She flicks her tongue over the tip, and he groans his approval. She wraps her small hand around his shaft and closes her lips around his head, bobbing her head and pumping her hand in unison. One hand settles at the nape of her neck and he guides her movement, urging his cock more deeply into her mouth. She cups his sac in her other hand and massages him gently. ""Shit, Katniss,"" Peeta hisses, tugging her hair roughly when his hand balls into a fist. His body becomes rigid and he frantically brushes her away. ""Not yet,"" he says, his breath labored. ""I don't want to come yet."" She nods and rises when he gestures for her to stand. He hoists her onto the pool table and his lips find her throat, licking his way to the neckline of her tank top to the valley between her breast. He settles between her legs and thrusts against her shorts. ""I want to be inside you so bad,"" he murmurs against her skin. And she nods wordlessly. It doesn't help, getting physical with him. Before, when she wasn't thinking about sex, she was almost functioning like a normal human being. Now when she isn't thinking about sex, she's having it. Madge teases her constantly. She bangs on the door whenever it's closed and shouts, ""Are you decent?"" so that everyone on the floor can hear. Peeta thinks it's funny, but Katniss is embarrassed by the attention. She never thought she'd be so fueled by her hormones. But when he hitches her legs over his shoulders and strokes her with his tongue, she's too drunk with lust to care."

""Shouldn't we - don't we need..."" she says. She's not on any sort of pill or shot like they have in the Capitol to prevent pregnancy, and she refuses to take any chances, regardless of what her body is currently demanding. ""It's okay, not yet. Not yet,"" he says. He slips off her underwear then settles between her legs to position his face at her entrance. Her hips buck wildly and she clenches her thighs together tightly when his tongue first touches her folds. He eases her legs apart and affectionately kisses the inside of her thigh. Her body relaxes and this time she welcomes his tongue when he kisses her there. A moan escapes her when he sucks her sensitive bundle of nerves between his lips, and she covers her mouth to muffle the next one. ""No, please,"" he says. ""I like to hear you."" She remember his earlier request and tries to stifle the embarrassment she feels at making a show. ""Peeta,"" she moans when he pumps his finger inside her. He licks her more furiously, thrusting in a second finger and then a third. ""Fuck, Katniss,"" he murmurs against her folds. She can't stand it anymore and her hips begin to roll with abandon. He pins her against the edge of the table and hitches her leg over his shoulder to bury his face deeper. ""Peeta,"" she nearly screams, fighting the edge of her orgasm. He replaces his tongue with his thumb, swirling her clit until she plummets, boneless against the table. ""Thank you,"" he pants, his cheek resting against her thigh. ""Why are you thanking me?"" she says. Suddenly she realizes the extent of her nudity, and she uses the corner of the tablecloth to help cover her. ""I've never really wanted to do that to anyone else before. But I really liked it with you."" He sits on his knees so only his chin is above the table. ""Honestly, I've only wanted to do any of this with you. Sometimes I pretend..."" he says, but quickly stops himself. ""I'm sorry, that's weird."" She sits up, pulling the tablecloth along with her. The thought leaves her feeling uneasy - he barely knows her, but after what he's been through, she can't fault him. She's held onto a fantasy of him after he tossed her the bread for a decade. ""It's not,"" she says. He sits up to kiss her, the taste of her still lingering slightly on his lips. She wants to be disgusted, but there's something exciting about it. ""What else do you want, Peeta?"" He groans and drags his mouth to her neck, chuckling against her throat between kisses. ""Keep doing that."" She hasn't done anything for him yet, and he still wears his arousal obviously on his lap. She should touch him or something, but she hesitates. ""Can I take you upstairs?"" he says. He carries her to his bedroom along with the tablecloth. She's starting to feel tired and his plush mattress isn't helping her fight sleep. She awakens when he begins to kiss her again, his hand idly playing with her breast to reignite the fading hunger. He leaves her briefly to retrieve a foil packet from a fancy silver box. In the Districts, birth control is hard to come by, but in the Capitol they have more forms than she can keep track of. Peeta removes his undershorts, leaving them both naked. Her eyes are drawn to his erection, although she tries not to look at it. The skin is a deeper red than the rest of him, and when she touches him, he almost feels like velvet. He offers her the packet. ""Do you want to?"" he says. Her eyes widen and she shakes her head, quickly dismissing the idea. He rolls the condom down his length and climbs onto the bed to position himself between her legs. She gasps when he brushes her entrance. ""I've never done this before,"" she finally admits. His face falls. ""What?"" ""I haven't - any of this."" ""What?"" he repeats. He blinks a few times. ""Why are you doing this?"" ""I don't know,"" she says honestly. ""Do you want me to stop? I will,"" he says and begins to roll away. She cages his hips with her knees. ""No. Keep going. I want you to."" He stares at her with uncertainty for a moment, his gaze hardening in the dim light. He balances himself above her and sinks into her slowly. It pinches at first, her body resisting his girth. She stretches to accommodate him, spreading her legs and angling her hips until the discomfort begins to wane. She tries to match his rhythm, rolling to meet every thrust, letting the movements of their bodies drive this new found pleasure. It's not as intense as when he used his fingers or mouth, but she's still cresting something wonderful. His pace quickens and his thrusts grow less study. It's odd. Although he's inside her, he feels impossibly far away. The moments downstairs seemed so intimate, but now she's left feeling cold. She gives up on finding release, and can only tighten her walls around him to coax his own escape. He comes after a few erratic thrusts, and pulls out of her almost instantly to discard the condom. She's not sure if they're supposed to talk afterward, and part of her doesn't want to. All of her clothing is downstairs, so she slips beneath the covers, naked, and pretends to sleep. At some point the mattress dips beside her, but the bed remains cold. When she wakes, her clothes are dry and folded at the foot of the bed, and his side is empty. It's only when she's dressed that she notices the fold of Capitol Credits on the night stand, and knows that they're for her. As always, you can find me on tumblr as absnow."
400,2,5,2-Larner-5.txt,lord-of-the-rings,Larner,"Foolish thing! she thought chidingly as she dove between his legs and bore him upward more swiftly than he could move upon his own. The skin of him felt remarkably smooth and thin against her flanks, which made the cloth appear that much more disturbing to her. Once he could easily make the last few feet to breathe once more, she fell away, and with a feeling of mischief she pulled away that last layer of fabric, leaving all of him to rejoice freely at the healing touch of the waters about him. And as she let the fabric go, drifting slowly downward to spite the dark ones who circled below that only so much of their desired prey came to them, she scented about him the musk of his maleness. And, for the first time since she'd repudiated her former mate, she felt a tingle within her, exciting her to the chance to once again know the joining of hröa and fëa that had been the delight of the Children of Ilúvatar since they were granted the ability to dwell within bodies and to populate Arda to fulfill the wishes of the Creator. Then you will consider the commission I would offer you? asked her lord within the depths of her heart. I will consider it, although I would know far more of him ere I would take a form upon myself with which we could communicate. For I discern he cannot take upon himself any other hröa than the one he bears now. That is so, Bryseluthea, her lord assured her. It is no simple thing I ask of you. Again she swam about the two-legs, jostling him with the others as he treaded water and then shifted upon his back to float upon the surface of the waves. She slipped out of the form of a dolphin and returned to the side of Lord Ulmo. He is mortal! He, then, is indeed the one you would have me love? Yes, that he is. She sensed her Lord's infinite patience with her need for assurance. And he will not be able to remain within the Bounds of Arda when his time comes. Nor does he wish to remain here indefinitely, child. But, should I choose to mate with him—it would distress his spirit terribly to know I could not follow him beyond the Circles of this world! That is one of the truths of the existence of mortals I have heard them repeat again and again when they have been saved from death and know they may not return to those they love—that they recognize that although they might not be reunited now, yet they will most likely meet anew once they approach the Presence of Eru. It reassures them, and gives them the estel they need to accept the renewed gift of their lives. Indeed that is so. She could feel the pride he took in her, and realized that to fully mate with this one he hoped she would come to love, she would indeed have to take on herself the fullness of that one's mortal nature. He is all that you have ever wanted to love, Bryseluthea. Yes, you would lose the promise of being tied to the life of Arda you know now; but are you strong enough to accept that perhaps there is an even greater reassurance you could know should you accept mortality? A few of Elvenkind have accepted that Gift and have passed beyond the bounds of Arda, and one more has accepted it and will follow her beloved husband when it is his time to go. Are you able to trust to Eru's mercy that much? She watched as a rope was lowered to the small mortal two-legs and he was drawn at last back onto the ship, back to his own world from hers, and found herself tingling with disappointment that this must be so. Could she love him, take him as a mate, join with him body and soul? But to do so she would have to sacrifice all that she had ever been since she'd awakened as a Child of the Sea. His life was finite—or at least that was so here, within Arda. And as she saw the sea anchor drawn in and the ship once more begin to move with current and wind, again heading for Aman, she knew that although he might sojourn there for a time yet he did not belong there, either, and must in the end leave there, too. It was much to think on. Almost absently she took leave of her Lord, and paid the dark ones below but scant attention as they tore the fabric she'd sent to them to pieces in lieu of the body they'd hoped to rend. At last she decided, she would watch him there, were it so given to her, and make her decision once she saw what kind of life he chose, what kind of home he took for himself. If he were to take a home within the sound of the surf perhaps she could bear it…. And Ulmo smiled with both sadness and hope as he watched her go and noted her decisions. With one concern eased, he turned upon the dark ones, dispersing them so it would take many cycles of the moon for them to find one another once more. He would not harm any of them, but their willingness to listen to the blandishments of the darkest of his brothers distressed him. He feared that even Darkfin must one day face the ire of those of his kind who had chosen the Light instead…. -(I)- Author's notes: ""Bryseluthea"" is the name originally given Anemone by Armariel, and it means ""Perilous Flower"". ""Falmalótë"" means ""Flower of the Wave"" and is the dear-name given her by Ulmo in my-verse. I hope that Armariel does not take offense! And thanks to Fiondil for the help in choosing a dear-name for her."

(I) (I) (I) Esme sat by the pallet fixed for Frodo in the Master's office, near the open door to the Master's parlor, listening to the argument raging between Menegilda and Bilbo. Frodo, who'd been given a sleeping draught by Master Beldir, was deeply asleep, hopefully unaware of the heated words passing between the Mistress of Brandy Hall and the Master of Bag End. ""You had no business taking the lad to the burial grounds, Bilbo Baggins. Who knows how far you might have set him back. He has a whispering in his heart--Beldir's told you and I've told you. The shock of seeing his father's body that way was more than he could bear--it almost killed him!"" ""I've been speaking with Laurel Chubbs in Hobbiton about hearts--she's worked with the Boffins for years, you know, and is quite aware of how the heart can fail. She says that it's likely not that bad, and shouldn't be permanent. She says it's not uncommon in children early born, but that they usually outgrow it by the time they're eighteen or so. But I'll wager that you and Esme and probably some of the others present were also on the verge of fainting or retching--or both, until the shock of seeing Frodo do so first snapped you out of it!"" Esme found herself almost smiling, for she knew that Bilbo's last supposition was all too right. Certainly the first thing Frodo had done on regaining consciousness had been to lose the entire contents of his stomach, not that he'd eaten all that much to begin with; but no one else had followed through on their own impulses to do likewise. He'd been quiet over the last few days, but had appeared at the door when the family gathered to go to the burial grounds neatly dressed, ready to accompany them. Menegilda had explained he would be staying in the Hall with Mistress Poppea and Willow and his Uncle Dodinas, and wouldn't be attending his parents' funeral. ""But they're my parents!"" he'd begun, but his aunt shook her head. ""They're your parents, but right now you are our responsibility, and you've already suffered one major shock--we won't see you suffer another."" Bilbo was apparently delayed at the Bucklebury Ferry, and Esme hoped that once he arrived he'd agree to stay in the Hall with the lad and distract his attention from what was happening in the burial grounds. However, not long after the last of the family arrived from the Brandywine Bridge and all was ready to begin, there was a stir from the area closest to the Hall as Bilbo made his way through the crowd with his arm about Frodo's shoulders. Frodo had remained quiet and filled with dignity as he saw the wide coffin that had been made to hold both of the married couple carefully lowered into the grave, and as their closest family he went forth first with his handful of earth and a wreath of flowers he'd been weaving that morning. Bilbo followed after, ignoring the glare Gilda gave him as she and Rory stepped forward to honor Primula as he was honoring Drogo. Then it was Dora who came forward with Dudo's arm about her while Amaranth and Dinodas also made their tributes followed by Asphodel and her family. Frodo had remained quiet throughout the meal that followed the funeral, and agreed both to retire early and to accept Beldir's draught; and now the long-delayed storm had broken. ""But it's my right and duty as his family head of name..."" ""Face it, Bilbo--you're not a young Hobbit any more for all you still don't look a day over sixty. You can't be expected to keep up..."" ""Nonsense--I cared for him as an infant and changed his nappies..."" ""...needs a mother's hand..."" ""What do you mean a mother's hand? You don't think you can keep up with him any better than I could?"" ""...And there's the matter of reputation to consider..."" ""No one of any sense listens to Lobelia's twaddle!"" ""No? Then why did Drogo bring Primula here from Hobbiton?"" ""They'd have done better to have remained and brazened it through, you realize."" ""Well, it's not twaddle that you left the Shire without a word and were gone for a year and a day, Bilbo Baggins!"" ""So what?"" ""We can give him so many advantages..."" ""And you think I couldn't provide for him properly? Really, Menegilda Goold!"" In the end Gilda won out, but only under condition that Bilbo be allowed to visit frequently and take Frodo along on his rambles throughout Buckland and the Marish, and that he be allowed to send what he wished to Frodo and the lad be allowed to receive it. And the ones chosen to serve as Frodo's foster parents would be Saradoc and Esmeralda. ""At least I know they'll be more concerned with his happiness than with trying to wrap him up in wool batting--try that and you'll most likely kill the boy."" Esmeralda looked back at the child lying on the pallet and brushed an errant curl from his forehead. He was hers now, for the next few years, at least. Her first child now. And one day there'd be another, one of her own, to be as little brother to him. But what a way to find herself a mother, at the loss of one of her favorite cousins, the cousin all had loved so dearly. ""Oh, Frodo-mine,"" she whispered, ""I'll do my best to see to it that nothing ever hurts you like that again, I promise dearling, upon all that's good and right in this world. Never again should you suffer."" And as he lay there, he seemed to shine somewhat in the growing dark in the room. A special one to whom she'd be a second mother. Again she stroked his brow, smiling at him."
402,2,21,2-Larner-21.txt,lord-of-the-rings,Larner,"""I do not believe he is dead, but he is certainly not with us at this time. Nor will he return."" ""Where did he go, Lord?"" ""To the Undying Lands. To Tol Eressëa."" Prince Imrahil felt a shock run through him. ""The Valar allowed a mortal to come to the Undying Lands?"" ""They have permitted two to go--the Ringbearer and his kinsman Bilbo who carried the Ring before him."" ""But, why?"" It took a few moments for Aragorn to answer him. ""It was in part in response to the plea made to them by my beloved Arwen--and confirmed by her father. And I am certain that Mithrandir had a hand in it, as well. You cannot believe what bearing the Enemy's Ring did to him, Imrahil. He was so hurt by it, so--emptied."" He took a drink of his wine to give himself time to steady himself, then set the goblet precisely on the table, focused on its stem. ""Frodo Baggins, son of Drogo and kinsman to Bilbo, was one of the most unusual beings I have ever dealt with in my ninety years in Middle Earth. As I once told Sam, he drew honor and loyalty to him as a lodestone draws fragments of iron. He brought out the best in almost everyone he ever met."" Again he paused. ""Including me."" Carefully turning the goblet, he finally continued. ""I first heard of him in Imladris from his elderly cousin Bilbo, who found the Ring in a cavern in the Misty Mountains, saving it from discovery from goblins there which assuredly would have sped it on its way to the Enemy had they found it first. Bilbo was devoted to Frodo, and often told me his young adopted heir was the best Hobbit in the Shire. His love for Frodo was deep and pure, and then I learned that Mithrandir felt the same for him. Gandalf told me Frodo inspired loyalty to an amazing degree, that those who came to know him well loved him intensely, and bound themselves to him. And then I actually saw him, saw the Light burning within Frodo Baggins on the road to Bree, outside the Old Forest and the Barrowdowns. And I found myself binding myself to him as well. ""You saw the loyalty shown him by his cousins and by Sam. You saw how anyone seeking to approach him had to get past Legolas and Gimli--and me. You saw how Mithrandir kept watch over him constantly. You saw the constant concern we all felt for him as he was recovering."" The Prince of Dol Amroth nodded. ""I would not be the person I am today if it hadn't been for his Light burning away my habit of disguising myself. Of course, the only way I survived for most of my life was by remaining hidden--first as Estel of Imladris, then as Thorongil of Rohan and Gondor, then as Strider in Eriador. But I couldn't accept the Winged Crown by being any less than what I am--the heir of Elendil and Isildur of the Line of Elros, the Dúnadan, bearer of the Star of Elendil and his sword as well as the Elessar stone. And it was in traveling with Frodo, who always called me by my rightful name, Aragorn, that I began to put aside all the disguises, to proclaim myself as I am. ""I would have gone with him into the fires of Orodruin, but he left us to spare the rest of us the temptation to which Boromir had come so close to succumbing. Always he tried to give himself for others. Always."" He took another sip of his wine, and then sat, looking down into the goblet, once again turning it between his fingers. He finally looked up into his companion's eyes. ""Healing someone ties you to him in a unique way. And--I helped heal him in Eriador, in Imladris, between Moria and Lothlorien, and finally after the battle. Except in none of those healings was I--were we--totally successful. For we could not fully counter the effects of the Enemy's weapons. Only the Valar can fully heal him, I fear. He was willing to cast himself into the Cracks of Doom for us all, but we could not relieve him of his pain."" He paused again, looked off. ""It's so foolish--he was stabbed by a Morgul blade and came within a hair's breadth of becoming a wraith himself; he was poisoned by the great spider in Cirith Ungol; he was beaten by orcs; he was taken by the Ring itself; he lost Ring and finger; he was overcome on the slopes of Mount Doom by starvation, lack of drink, weakness, and the poison of the air--and he says he cannot imagine what the rest survived!"" He closed his eyes and shook his head. Imrahil looked on his liege with compassion. ""I did not know just how deeply he was hurt."" ""Merry wrote me that they've learned his heart had begun to fail him, and each anniversary of his woundings he grew steadily worse. He should have been on the ship to Elvenhome during the last anniversary, and Sam was not certain he'd survive even accompanied as he was by the Lord Elrond, the Lady Galadriel, and Mithrandir."" ""So, Mithrandir has left Middle Earth indeed?"" ""Yes. I begged him to stay and rule us all, but he said to do so would only serve to make him Middle Earth's next tyrant."" He looked again into his companion's eyes. ""I want to do a proper memorial for Frodo son of Drogo."" ""And you think to get it from the mannikin?"" ""Those who tried to picture Frodo from life failed. Perhaps by studying Frodo as seen by others as he did with my portrait this Ruvemir can find a way to do a sculpture that feels more real than the portraits so inadequately done by the artists of Minas Tirith."" The Prince considered. ""It is at least worth the trying, don't you agree?"""
403,2,7,2-Larner-7.txt,lord-of-the-rings,Larner,"forgive me for exercising my nature."" Elrond Peredhil gave a brief nod. ""I was wondering, Lord Elrond, more about the Elvish languages. I've read words in the books you shared with my grandfather that I feel I can begin to understand, but wanted to learn more."" ""Sindarin or Quenya?"" ""I'd rather thought both, if that is acceptable for one not of your race."" The Elf laughed. ""And why would it not be acceptable for one not of my race?"" ""Well, I've learned the Dwarves don't readily teach others their native tongue."" ""That is mostly because even among Dwarves it is rarely known, save for place names. There are a few who know it, but they are mostly the direct descendants of Durin himself."" ""And I suppose that Thorin is unlikely to teach me more, then."" ""I fear you have the right of it, Master Baggins. We, however, have no such restrictions on our languages, save among ourselves; and then it is most likely due to smoldering resentments ages old. But such are not permitted here within the vale of Imladris. Now, if you truly wish to learn Sindarin..."" A number of tomes were brought out, and Bilbo looked at them with surprise, awe, and pleasure. ""I can't take these with me."" ""No, small Master. But we will keep them in the room given to your use for when you return."" ""I hope that will happen,"" the Hobbit said with some concern. ""I do not believe you have much to worry about on that account,"" the Elf said, smiling. ""You appear to be intended for some other fate than being lost down Smaug's gullet."" ""That is reassuring, I must say,"" Bilbo said. ""Although I wonder, now that the Took in me has been so awakened, if I will ever be content to remain sedately at home in Bag End from now on."" ""Would that be a bad thing?"" ""For a Hobbit, it is social disaster, my Lord. However, I find myself wondering why I ever cared."" Elven Lord and family head for the Bagginses of the Shire looked to one another, smiling into one another's eyes. (I) (I) (I) Bilbo spent one more morning on his balcony watching young Estel at play in the gardens, seeing him and his imaginary brothers facing down Smaug the Dragon. It was himself that was hurt this time, burnt by the Dragon's fire; and bravely he accepted the ministrations of Gil-galadrion and Anorahil as they bathed the grievous wound and rubbed ointment onto it and bandaged it loosely. He had no care for the Dragon's hoard of treasure; only, apparently, the desire to see the end of its evil and to bask in the company of his brothers. It was as the imaginary brothers went off to see to the safety of the nearby folk of Laketown that one of his Elven brothers came searching for him. ""And what mighty adventure have you had this morning, Estel?"" ""I was imagining how it would be to fight the Dragon of the Lonely Mountain. I can't see how Master Bilbo Baggins is to manage it, for he has no skill at weapons. He carries the short sword he found, but Glorfindel says he has not learned to use it well."" ""He was not chosen by the Dwarves to accompany them for his prowess with weapons, but for his skills as a burglar, to be inconspicuous and quiet and clever--that and to be the one to change the number of the party from thirteen to fourteen. He will most likely not fight the Dragon, but instead will seek to confuse and confound it."" ""When do you ride out against the orcs again?"" ""After the Dwarves have left, although few will openly brave the passes in the weather coming."" ""I wish I could go with you."" ""When you can best our brother sparring with swords we will take you, but not until then."" The boy gave a great sigh, and said, ""So be it, then. I must work hard at it."" The tall Elf caressed the side of the boy's face. ""You have ever worked at it, tithen nin , and already are becoming very good for a youth. Now, come. It is time for you to study with Lord Erestor on languages now."" Obediently Estel followed the Elf back toward a distant section of the place where apparently he was to meet with Lord Erestor. (I) (I) (I) The next morning after meeting with the Dwarves, Bilbo set off for the kitchens to see if he could wangle a decent second breakfast. They would be setting off for the passes on the morrow, and he found himself both dreading and delighting in the prospect. How on earth was he going to deal with dragons? He was a Hobbit, not a great, Elven-trained warrior. Well , he thought, best to deal with but one step at a time . Surviving the passes, he realized after hearing the tale Lord Elrond's son Elrohir had told the previous night of their last sweep of the pass beyond Rivendell, would be a feat in its own right. He shuddered at the thought of perhaps meeting goblins there, for they sounded fearsome in the extreme, and probably far worse than what had been described in the books he'd loved. As he waited for the Elven maiden serving in the kitchens that day to prepare a plate for him, he glanced out the window and saw young Estel kneeling with two others in the kitchen garden, weeding the lines of vegetables and herbs. It was nice to see that the child was given similar chores to those which a Hobbit lad might be expected to perform. The boy's grey eyes were intent on the rich soil, and his hand worked deftly with the weeding tool. It was the last time Bilbo was to see the boy for some time, and the last he even thought of him until his return to Rivendell months later."
404,2,2,2-Larner-2.txt,lord-of-the-rings,Larner,"came to give you and Lobelia my condolences and, as family head, to offer whatever aid we Bagginses can give, Otho."" The younger Hobbit merely looked at him. ""Are you going to offer me a chair?"" suggested Bilbo at last. Otho finally waved vaguely about the room, at which Bilbo sat himself on the wing chair in the corner. ""I am so very sorry, Otho,"" he began. At last his cousin spoke. ""I suppose it was only for the best,"" he said rather abruptly. Bilbo was shocked. ""For the best? How can losing a child ever be for the best? Do you know--do you know if it would have been a lad or a lass?"" ""Laurel Chubbs didn't tell you?"" ""Laurel Chubbs? Gossip about her patients? I rather think not, Otho. All she would say was that the child was lost, reporting it to your family heads as is customary, you know. And as the child would have been my heir after you, I do feel I have a personal interest in the situation, you know. Although I don't understand your father's attitude. I understand he was here, but not Camellia?"" ""My mother--bestir herself for anything unpleasant? How poorly you know her, Bilbo."" There was decided bitterness there. ""There was no time to send for anyone from Lobelia's family, of course, although Dock was visiting family in Overhill and came at once when I sent to advise her. She and Lobelia aren't particularly close, but she does have family feeling and has been very helpful, of course."" ""Yes, I saw that,"" Bilbo answered, managing to keep the irony he felt out of his voice. ""Shall I help with the funeral arrangements?"" ""A funeral? For a child born so early?"" The Baggins paused. From what Longo had confided to a small group of gentlehobbits to which Bilbo was attached at the Green Dragon the night before, the child hadn't been born all that early--indeed had been due at any time. Lobelia and Otho had married while he was gone, although even before he'd hared off with the Dwarves and Gandalf there had been more than adequate signs that this was where the wind was blowing, once Lobelia had gotten the idea he wasn't the least interested in her and was not to be maneuvered into a compromising situation, and after Drogo had retreated to Buckland to escape her attentions as well. The lass had seemed intent on marrying into Baggins money and respectability no matter what; that she'd deliberately put the dessert before the meal in order to force a marriage was certainly well within her character. But it appeared that Otho was intent on pretending this child was indeed far too early to have survived the birth, and that was disturbing to the older Hobbit. Longo had last night been feeling rather contrite about the rumors Lobelia had started about Teron, from what Bilbo had been able to see--his uncle had been patently ignoring his presence, after all. But if Otho was going to act as if the child was born too soon, what could be done about it? Those who'd been privy to Longo's intelligence the previous evening and most likely their wives and families would quietly spread the word, of course, and there would be added that much more disdain given Otho and Lobelia as a response, particularly as the two of them had so benefited from the slander Lobelia has spread about her husband's cousin. But it was a Baggins trait to avoid looking anything but prim and proper in the eyes of the Shire, after all... ""I see,"" Bilbo said at last. ""Too early to survive. Then you are allowing the midwife to see to the disposal of the child?"" ""I don't see how we could do more, Bilbo. It's not as if it had had the chance to live."" For a moment Bilbo saw a brief indication of grief there, although Otho immediately hid it away. He felt some relief--apparently Otho--and hopefully Lobelia as well--had been happily anticipating the birth of this child. It was a sign that there was still some humanity in their hearts. ""I see."" But later that day he stopped by Lavender Sandybanks's home and arranged for a quiet internment for the poor child, and he sent down flowers from Bag End to lay over the unmarked grave. (I) (I) (I) /It was surprised that the temporarily unprotected child had died as a result of Its touch on its fëa , but was pleased to find It had managed to cause grief to that pair and to the Baggins as well. And to realize that the unborn boy-child would have been dear to the Baggins in spite of its parents pleased It the more. If It had managed to disturb the feeling of continuity for Its current bearer... It was difficult, however, to fully stay awake. It was in an environment that was antithetical to Its nature, and Its true Master had been forced to flee his fortress and was not yet ready to declare himself as Lord of Mordor. However, It set a small part of Its awareness to keeping an eye on matters. It had avenged Its current bearer and had seen his curse carried out, at the same time meeting the desires of Its previous bearer. We curses the Bagginses! Yes, that one had cursed this one's family, and It would delight in punishing the Baggins who held It by seeing that family diminished as It could. Yes, It would keep an Eye--the bit of the Eye as it contained--on future potential heirs to this one. Let the Bagginses fade away to obscurity. It could be patient, after all. If a gold Ring could yawn, It did so as It slid into a torpor, yet left Its awareness sufficiently focused that It might waken at any time it appeared another Baggins was likely to be born. Oh, yes, that curse spoken by Gollum It was proud to fulfill./"
405,2,8,2-Larner-8.txt,lord-of-the-rings,Larner,"children as great grandparents, after all. I think at times it's there for you, but it's stronger in Pippin than it is in you. But, then, one day he most likely will succeed his father as the Thain."" After Merry gave him a brief smile, he continued, ""It's rather odd that the Took Sight has been stronger in Bilbo than it ever was in Ferumbras or than it is in Paladin. Gramma Mirabella once told me that when he was a little lad she was certain she'd seen it in Bilbo, but that it didn't seem to be anywhere as strong once he was an adult. I suspect that this was due to the fact that he'd done his best to suppress it as he approached his majority. After all, at the time he was very intent on being a proper Baggins indeed, and ' Knowing Things Ahead of Time can be Disturbing,' as Aunt Dora would put it."" There was a scattering of chuckles about the room. Merry gave a wan smile. ""Imagine that the strongest case of Took Sight that's been seen since old Gerontius was Thain has been displayed by a Baggins, for there's no question but that Frodo's always had it. But then Frodo has been gifted strongly with so many of the Fallohide traits, after all. While you were gone your mother worried so for you and for Pippin, but she felt that the greatest danger lay ahead for Frodo."" Merry murmured, ""Yes, that was true. We were all in danger, and we all almost died there at the end of the fighting; but it was worst for Frodo. The Enemy wanted him, and did his best to take him. First there was the Morgul shard, and if we'd not reached Rivendell in time Frodo would have been lost to us—not dead, Dad, but truly lost nonetheless. Then he was poisoned by the spider when they were ready to enter Mordor, and Sam thought he was dead until he overheard some orcs discussing the kinds of poisons the spider used and how Frodo would most likely wake up in a few hours, so Sam set about to rescue him. Then, at the very last the— It —finally took him. If that horrible Gollum hadn't been there it would have been all over, Dad—the Enemy would have taken Frodo and gotten his weapon back, and then the truly Dark Days would have come again the way they did in the Second Age."" The Master nodded uncertainly, and cleared his throat. ""I see,"" he responded. He looked off thoughtfully, and finally returned his attention to his son. ""When your Mum saw Frodo, she, too, saw that something was taking him. The grey cloak changed to white robes, and there was a crown of mixed darkness and light that was being woven about his brow, same as this fellow said. She told me she knew that if that crown managed to finish forming that Frodo would be lost to us."" At Merry's nod, he gave a shuddering sigh. ""Only something happened, didn't it?"" ""I told you—if Gollum hadn't been there, that would have been it. He was trying only to get his treasure back, but in taking it he managed to save Frodo."" ""Bilbo's Gollum?"" ""Yes, Bilbo's Gollum. He'd been traveling all through Middle Earth, looking for the Baggins he believed stole his Precious, and he found us when we entered Moria and followed after us—after Frodo."" ""Where is he now?"" ""Dead, bless him."" ""How?"" ""He died after he attacked Frodo. It was what saved Frodo, him being attacked by Gollum."" The Master squeezed his eyes shut. ""The stars bless him!"" ""Which, Frodo or Gollum?"" ""Both?"" They searched one another's faces, father and son, and gave matching twisted smiles. The tall Man cleared his throat. ""So, somehow, while they carried the Enemy's weapon, they appear to have become aware of the danger threatening here in the Shire and managed to—interfere?"" Merry rose to his feet, turning toward the Man. ""Yes, Lord Faradir, that is what appears to have happened. Lord Faradir gave a single slow nod of his head. ""Then I shall so advise the King. I am certain that our Lord King Elessar will be interested in this report."" Merry again gave a twisted smile. ""I suspect that you are correct, my Lord."" They all turned to examine the seated prisoners. ""What's to be done with these, then?"" asked one of the seated Hobbits. Lord Faradir said, ""With your permission I will take them away and question them, after which I suspect that all of them will be allowed to go free, as long as they are willing to return to their own lands and trouble no one either here in the north or in Rohan or Gondor ever again."" ""But they did some terrible things to some of our people!"" objected the one who'd brought the ale. Merry, the Master, and Lord Faradir exchanged meaningful looks, and at last the Man answered, ""Perhaps they did. However, the Lord Iorhael has made it clear that he does not wish ill treatment to be rewarded with more of the same, and I will see his will done."" The Dunlending wasn't precisely certain what all of this meant, but he found himself grateful to this mysterious and apparently powerful Lord Iorhael for his mercy. As he and his fellows were prodded to their feet, he commented quietly to one of his former comrades, ""I don't have no objections t'goin' home and stayin' there, do you?"" ""None!"" the other Dunlander answered. ""Wherever he is, hope that he rests well t'night."" (I) As Frodo settled himself under the covers of the bed in the room given to his use at the Cotton's house, he found himself smiling, and indeed his dreams that night were filled with images of light-filled beings who showed him beautiful things, although the next morning he could not say what it was they had showed to him."
406,2,13,2-Larner-13.txt,lord-of-the-rings,Larner,"for the moment with their view of their Chieftain who had returned to them with his family, now ruler of both Gondor and Arnor. Maglor, however had gone beyond the flat area where tents, pavilions, and campfires had risen, and sat now within a spinney of young alders, overwhelmed by the memories raised by the sight of Elrond's Captain, daughter, and grandchildren. How he'd come to love those two boys that he and his brother had brought out of the ruins of Sirion! Even if they had forced the children's mother to fling herself from the height of the tower window down to the Sea below, yet in time Elrond and Elros had come to accept him as their guardian and teacher, and everything he'd not been able to teach his own son he'd left behind in Tirion he'd sought to teach these two. Elros had chosen mortality and had left the Circles of Arda two Ages of the Sun past, while Elrond he'd seen leaving with the other Ringbearers at the end of the Third Age, a mere fifteen circlings of Anor ago. He'd had but mere glimpses of Elrond since the day Maglor and his brother had slain the guards set over the two remaining Silmarils and they'd sought to escape with them, thinking their father's vow finally fulfilled. Maedhros had ended up destroying himself, giving himself and his shining burden into the heart of the Earth itself, while Maglor had thrown his own Silmaril into the keeping of the Sea, seeing again in the arc of his throw the fall of Elwing with the Nauglamir upon her breast. Now and then Maglor had approached wherever it was that Elrond had been living, contenting himself with glimpses from afar of his remaining foster son, glad that at least he'd had a hand in the forming of this one good soul. And he'd been close enough when the ship carrying the Ring-bearers set sail from Mithlond to see the great weariness on Elrond's face, alongside the gladness that at last he was able to set aside the burden of rule and guard he'd held since the founding of Imladris followed by the loss of Ereinion Gil-galad. How glad Maglor had been to realize that his fosterling had been the bearer of one of Celebrimbor's Rings of Power during the years when all of good will had stood in defiance of Sauron! Sauron had finally been defeated, his power destroyed because one of those small Periain had managed to defy the evil will of Sauron's own Ring to bring It back to Mordor where at last It was unmade in the very Fires in which It had been forged. Both Elrond and Maglor's kinswoman Artanis Galadriel had willingly offered up their own power to see the Ring destroyed. Now they'd gone out of Middle Earth forever, taking with them the Perian who'd thought to sacrifice himself to see that purpose fulfilled. If only he and Maedhros had shown similar integrity, Maglor thought as his tears slid down his face. ""Here he is, the one who somehow has Frodo's shirt studs upon him!"" Maglor looked up, shocked, to find he was no longer alone. Facing him directly was a russet-headed Dwarf with a most grim expression. How in Middle Earth had he failed to hear the arrival of one of the Naugrim ? And what would a Dwarf know about the gift that the small bearer of the One had made to him the night before that grey ship left the quays of Mithlond? It had been such a chance encounter, the Hobbit having intended only to relieve himself before returning to his rest before the last leg of his journey to the Havens. What had moved the Cormacolindo to make the gift of the studs he wore to hold closed the cuffs of his shirt Maglor still did not understand, but he wore them humbly, a memorial to one whose discernment and compassion he'd known but a brief moment ere he was gone. The Dwarf was not alone. He was accompanied by a Perian with a broad frame, and a much taller and slender cloaked figure. ""I'd wondered how my Master'd managed to mislay those shirt studs that last night of our ride to the Sea,"" the Hobbit said. ""He didn't explain, not that he was up to speakin' anyways by that time."" The cloaked individual murmured, ""What I was wondering was how he managed to be garbed in a shirt that I myself wrought. I recognized my own work from the brief glimpse I had of the sleeve."" It was a woman's voice, low and musical, reminiscent of the voice of Elwing he'd heard but the once, just before she'd leapt through that window. She thrust back the hood of her cloak, and he found himself looking into the face of Elrond's daughter, now the Queen of Arnor and Gondor. She was examining him closely, and he quailed before the Light of Stars to be seen in those beautiful grey eyes of hers. ""So,"" she whispered, ""this is the way of it, is it? I think I understand!"" He could only look at her dumbly before he dropped his gaze. But she would not allow that. She set a shapely finger beneath his chin and caused him to raise his head to meet her eyes once more. ""I'd always wondered if one day we might meet, Macalaurë son of Fëanáro,"" she said more formally. And then she smiled at him, and his heart leapt within his breast. ""I am so very glad to greet you at last, daeradar ,"" she said, and indeed he felt encompassed by the love that Timriol son of Findrion had foretold! -~0~- daeradar - grandfather epessë - a nickname given by another that has become accepted by the recipient Morgil - Dark Star Russandol - Redhead, one of the epessës given to Maedhros when he was young Vanimelda - my beloved one, an endearment"

Further down the gully a fish ventured up the ditch from the canal, and worked at tasting the body of the first of the two who lay there. The otter reentered the ditch midway between the placement of the single body and the other two. Again it approached the child it had visited before, but again the muskrat chased it away. The otter turned down the ditch and realized that there were more food sources available, and climbed upon the nearer child's back as it had done earlier. It scratched at the child's arm and again sought to gnaw at this abundance of meat. It licked at the caked blood about the head wounds. It chewed on the back of an ear. Again the owl swooped over, clawing at the otter as it was focused on the child's body. The pain of the talons catching at it drew its attention to its danger, and the otter turned and bit at the owl's leg, which had failed to get a good purchase. The bird screeched in its pain, and the otter, the other talon withdrawn, dove beneath the surface and swam for the deeper water of the canal itself, seeking the place nearest its burrow where it typically entered and left the water, looking to lick its wounds in peace. Rats and muskrats came and prodded the bodies; but they were too large and freshly killed to easily prey upon as yet. At one point a wild dog approached, but was chased away by a number of smaller scavengers. No one, however, sought to dissuade the badger when it came. It entered the shallow water near the third child, and worked frantically trying to release the delicate face from the hold the mud held on it. Eyes and cheeks were usually soft, after all. It managed to do a good deal of scratching to one cheek and worried at one of the ears. Several of the rats did their best to bite the bodies here and there, or dug at them with their claws, until a snake came gliding through the ditch and took one of them from in the midst of them all; the rest fled. Then the ditch was quiet as the sky greyed in the east. Night hunters and scavengers were now looking to return to their dens for the day; a different group became active. Father turtle had burrowed into the mud for the night just above the point where the ditch joined the canal, and as Anor shone more fully down on the ditch and the water temperature began to rise he awoke and clawed his way out of the mud. Smelling the scent of carrion within the water he began working his way toward the source of the scent, stopping when vibrations indicated Men were passing through the gully. Once they were gone and all was again still, he continued on his way until he found himself at the nearest body. The hind-parts were presented, considering the manner in which the body had been tied and then pressed, face down, into the mud. There was soft flesh here, and he came closer to examine it, bit here, bit there, then found a goodly body of soft tissue. The body didn't move-it was plainly dead and ready for the eating. Satisfied it could take its time, the great turtle opened its horny beak and bit down, severing the tender sac, pulling soft skin off adjoining members, glad to have this wonderful, filling meal. Having finally secured its prize, the turtle turned toward the canal, swam down into it until it found its favorite sunning spot, there pulling itself out to eat at its leisure. Smaller turtles followed their father, biting and clawing, each leaving its mark. A few weasels examined the bodies as well, digging their claws into the flesh to try to get a better purchase. Meanwhile, down in the mud under the bodies, the mud-dwelling crustaceans began awakening and congregating about the bodies, each leaving its tiny, bloodless wound as it found enough flesh to provide a more than ample meal for such small creatures. Some of the larger such creatures that sifted the mud about the clothing managed to break the suction that had held one shoe down; then a second one. The cured leather of these items was not particularly succulent, so they returned to the bodies. Near noon father turtle returned, crawling up on the back of one of the bodies and, like the otter, trying to get at the face, turned as it was slightly to the side. The marks of its claws were left on the child's shoulder and cheek when more vibrations indicated that Men had returned again to the wooded gully. The turtle slipped rapidly into the water and swam under the surface back into the canal. The crustaceans burrowed back down into the mud. Rats and weasels slipped away and into hiding. Before the scavengers could return again, one of those who'd come into the gully this time had scurried back to the village, summoning village guardsmen. Within an hour the bodies were lifted out of the water and laid on the banks, and one of those who'd found them, looking at the damage done to the genitals of one of the bodies, proclaimed, ""Danárion has done this, seeking to offer worship to the Nameless One!"" And those who'd come agreed-all knew that Danárion of Destrier had a bad name and had interest in subjects that were best left alone. Father turtle, later in the day, returned to the ditch, but the source of the delectable meat he'd enjoyed was now gone. So it turned back toward the canal, where it soon found an unwary fish. Soon it was back at its sunning spot, completing a second meal for the day."

Some days it was only the memories of stories you once told that kept me from going insane."" All within the room looked at one another, sharing glances of wonder and concern--none as yet had heard any of the details of where the four Travelers had gone or what they'd done while they were absent from the Shire. Frodo sighed. ""You can take them out to the banquet room--and watch they don't take anything more. By the way, turn out Torto's pockets."" The older of the two lads looked affronted at being singled out, but in moments they had relieved him of a number of things he'd been quietly removing from Hillie's corner of the office, and at a significant look from Frodo Tito quietly returned a mug he'd lifted and tried to hide behind his back. Once Guido had returned the quill and the penwipe again the remaining family members were led away to join Barti and Tribbals in the other room, and Frodo drew a clean sheet of vellum to him and wrote out the order for the Broadloams' servitude, and tried to think from whom he could purchase seven hens and a rooster at this time of the day. At last he wrote that he'd send the promised chickens to Mallard the following day and rose to go out to deliver it to Cock Robin. ""You'll see this into Mallard's hands?"" he asked quietly. ""Gladly, Mr. Frodo, sir,"" Robin assured him. ""Must say as it's a most unusual sentence."" ""It will relieve Mistress Quince,"" Frodo said with a glance at the Hobbitess where she sat with her daughter in her lap, ""and hopefully will give incentive to the lads to learn a skill or two regarding how to properly raise stock of their own."" He looked at the Broadloam family with interest. Greencap and the lads had been made to sit in the center of the room, away from anything they might be tempted to try to pocket, but they appeared cheerfully resigned. ""We know as you don't mean no insult by it,"" Guido assured those guarding the integrity of the room from this surfeit of Broadloams, then he looked at Frodo as he approached him, his characteristic wheedling grin fading as he examined the face of the deputy Mayor he'd seen so often as a lad, almost as if he were searching for something he remembered from that time. ""Ye had a hard time of it, then,"" he said with uncharacteristic solemnity. ""Mayhap ye're not certain as ye ought to've come back, even. But I've the feelin' as ye'll be good for the Shire, Master Baggins, sir--good for the Shire. Old Flour Dumplin'--he'd of never thought to of done as ye have, ye know."" ""No, Will would never have done what I've done; but, then, of course, I'm not him. Now, you keep your side of the bargain and I'll keep mine. And your daughter will sit on your lap before all to hear with the rest."" ""But why, Master Baggins, sir? Why let 'er see as how cruel the world is t' those as is different?"" ""Do you love her? Are you proud of her?"" Guido's voice in response was almost derisive. ""Well, o' course!"" ""Then let your own love for her be seen by all. Let all others know it; and if they realize you love and respect her, they'll realize they should treat her well, also. Yes, some like Lotho Sackville-Baggins are cruel and will remain cruel toward such as she no matter what; but those whose opinions mean the most will respond as you show the way. And she has as much right to hear the stories as all the other children do."" Greencap Broadloam searched Frodo's face some more, then with a touch of true respect such as he rarely showed he said, ""O' course, sir. Thankee, sir."" He rose and addressed his sons. ""We'll go, then, but until we's out o' the hole we're touchin' nothin', lads."" And the lads, their expressions surprised, rose. At a look from their father Torto removed a small bridle brass that had hung on the wall from his pocket and set it on the table, and Tito solemnly handed Robin Smallburrow his wallet for his pipeweed. Then with a marked dignity Greencap set his cap on his head, reached down to take his daughter gently into his arms, and led his family out of the hole, accompanied by Cock Robin and Bartimo Tunnely. As they passed the deputy Mayor, Tribbals turned her head to smile into Frodo's eyes, and he found himself smiling freely in return. ""Why do you want seven hens and a rooster?"" Everard Took asked Frodo the following morning. ""You've never kept poultry."" ""Does it matter why I want them?"" Frodo asked, annoyed. ""They are an investment of sorts, and I never said I would wish to keep them myself."" ""Well, as Lotho's folks never got into the Tooklands properly, it does happen that three of the farm folk on the northern borders were able to keep their flocks. Maybe we can convince Borigrin to give you a few. Frodo shook his head. ""As I said, this is an investment, so I insist on paying a fair price. I do ask that the hens be good layers and young, though."" ""He's to be in here in about an hour's time anyway--we can ask him when he comes, then."" And before mid-afternoon Borigrin Took was crating up nine chickens for a trip to Whitfurrow, the Took having decided to make certain that all Frodo had asked and more would arrive safely at the other end. It had been a time since Bori had seen Frodo Baggins, and he'd been shocked at the expression in his distant cousin's eyes. Whatever he could do to ease Frodo's worries and burdens he'd quietly determined to see to."

I must say that as the blossoms open I tend to feel as if I had both you and Frodo by me, sharing in the delight of it."" Sam nodded his understanding. ""Well, at least we're here by you in person. I only hope as Frodo realizes we must be together, and that we're all thinkin' of him."" As Rosie settled herself by her husband's side she momentarily took and squeezed his hand. ""I'm sure of it, lovey. How could he ever doubt that?"" When all were finished they were arranged into a procession of sorts by Gimli, and all approached the great veiled structure that had been raised upon the spur. There they were met by Master Celebgil himself, who looked down on them all, and particularly on Master Ruvemir, who'd been his master in the White City in the last years of his own apprenticeship. The younger sculptor cleared his throat, then began: ""I wish to greet you all this day, and thank you for coming here to see this monument unveiled. How many in the future may choose to come to see it I could not say, as isolated in many ways as it is. However, this is a point of importance in the final battle of the War of the Ring, the place where our beloved King, who had not yet accepted the Winged Crown, came to the succor of the Cormacolindor as they were brought out of the destruction of Mordor and the torment of Mount Doom. We know now that neither of those restored to us had expected to survive that turmoil, but the Powers and the One saw to it that they received the grace to be assured their sacrifices had not been in vain. ""That this event never be forgotten by the peoples of the western lands, we now unveil this memorial to that moment."" So saying, he gave a signal to his apprentices, who, assisted by Princess Melian and Elanor Gardner, pulled the ropes that uncovered the great grouping. This was constructed not of stone, but of bronze, and consisted of depictions of three of the great Eagles facing the King in his battle armor, the figure of the Wizard Mithrandir beside him, all of them set on the lower slopes of the great spur of the mountain. Highest up, as if settling himself on a rocky outcrop, Gwaihir the Windlord was shown just beginning to fold his great wings. Gandalf had just received the body of Samwise Gamgee into his arms from the second Eagle, and was tenderly pulling the Hobbit close to his breast. And Aragorn was holding out his hands to accept the form of Frodo Baggins from the talon of the third Eagle. All stood, examining the grouping in awe, when cries from above caused them to look up. Out of the glory of the blue sky dropped a half dozen of the great Eagles, each alighting near the monument. Immediately Men, Elves, and Dwarves pulled back respectfully. Once the birds were settled, the King and Queen of the West stepped forward with Radagast to greet them. ""We welcome you, and rejoice you have come to join us as we honor the memory of the saving of the Ringbearers,"" the Lord Elessar said, bowing deeply. ""Certainly had it not been for your assistance it is likely none of us would be here now, and particularly not Lord Samwise and his family."" The Eagles fixed their gaze on Sam, who had been beckoned forward by the King, and who stepped forward steadily enough, although he was flushing deeply. Gwaihir bobbed his head respectfully toward the Hobbit. ""We greet you, Lord Perhael, and are glad you have made the journey from your own land for this."" ""And I thank you for drawin' my Master and me from the destruction of the mountain,"" he answered, bowing low. ""We'd of not survived if'n you hadn't braved the rocks and all to come and find us."" ""And this is one of your young?"" the Windlord asked, fixing his attention on Elanor, who had followed her father forward. He turned his head to examine the Hobbit lass carefully, and appeared enthralled. ""A worthy child, and blessed by all, I would say."" Again he bobbed his head, this time to Elanor. ""Lord Iorhael must have rejoiced to see you born, child."" She curtseyed. ""Yes, I'm told he was very glad, although I barely remember him. He went away when I was still a small bairn."" Sam put his arm about her and drew her to his side, a gesture that appeared to spark approval in the eyes of the Eagles, who now all turned their attention to the memorial. ""It is much as it was,"" commented one of the others, ""although, Lord Gwaihir, I don't remember you having gone up so high."" Gwaihir made a noise that Sam realized was his manner of laughing. ""And never did I do so; but it is a worthy depiction in spite of that, I think. And they have caught your reluctance to release the Cormacolindo to the Eagle of the Star very well, Landroval."" The other Eagle mantled slightly, perhaps in embarrassment, but all in all the great birds appeared pleased by the depiction made. Master Celebgil now bowed to the Eagles. ""And I thank you all for your agreement to allow yourselves to be depicted, and for the patience you showed while we sketched you to make certain we caught your seemings as faithfully as we were able."" ""You have done well enough,"" Gwaihir answered him. ""It was our honor to be allowed to do all that we did in that last battle. To face down the Nazgûl and the dumb beasts they'd enslaved was most satisfying. And to be allowed to bring Lords Perhael and Iorhael out of the destruction was even more so."""

Mortals can't go that way, not without a special grace granted by the Powers. Only Bilbo, Frodo, and Sam have been offered this grace, and obviously from what Frodo's written Sam doesn't have to accept the invitation now."" ""But where is Frodo going?"" demanded Beri. ""To the Elven lands, West of the Sundering Sea,"" his uncle answered him. ""Where the Powers themselves can offer him healing."" ""But he wasn't sick----"" Beri began, but the Thain cut him off. ""He's dying, Beri. He'll die if he doesn't accept this, and he knows it. We could see it in his eyes when we had dinner with him at Bag End that last time."" Sara looked at his brothers and nephew. ""Is Brendi in the place?"" he asked. ""He's been mostly in Buckleberry meeting with Oderdoc's family for the past few days,"" Mac said. ""I don't know if he's back yet from today's session."" ""There was a letter for him, too,"" Esme said, picking up another envelope from the table by her chair and displaying it. ""I asked Horto to keep an eye out for him and let him know I have it."" There was a knock at the door, and Horto, who was door warden for the day, led in a Bounder Sara recognized as one of those who guarded the gate at the Brandywine Bridge. ""Beg pardon, Master, Mistress,"" Horto said, ""but Garthfast here's come with a summons from the Bridge. From a Man, I understand,"" he said, his distaste obvious. Garth was a steady lad originally from the Tighfield area in the Northfarthing. He knuckled his forehead in respect, his eyes worried. ""There's a Man, sir,"" he explained. ""Come to the gates today and stopped. Tall, ridin' a tall bay horse, he was. Silver cloak about him, with a star on the shoulder like them Men as come afore to send word to you. The one with the black glove is with 'im, and the young one with the hound, too. Tall one on the bay's the one as come to the gate this time. Says as he's the Lord Halladan or somethin' like, sir, and that you met with 'im there in Bree, sir. Says as he's come to bring you word about Lord Frodo. Who's this Lord Frodo, sir? He don't mean Frodo Baggins, do he?"" Saradoc took in a deep breath, then let it out. ""Yes, I think he does,"" he said. ""Frodo and Samwise Gamgee are considered Lords of the Realm in the outer world, you see."" He looked around the room at the others, then turned back to Garth with decision. ""Go back to the bridge, and bring the three of them across and into the common room at the Bridge Inn. And if they try to give you any argument about the King's edict, tell them this is my order, as the Bridge Inn is under my jurisdiction and Buckland isn't specifically part of the Shire--not exactly. See to it they get the finest wine or ale or whatever they please that's available. Tell them that we're coming, but need to speak to one of our own before we can leave the Hall."" Garth nodded reluctantly. ""As you say, then, sir,"" he said. ""I'll leave now, then. Into the common room at the Bridge Inn, you say?"" ""Yes."" Sara's voice was definite. ""Will do, then, sir."" Again Garth knuckled his forehead and went out, his duty clear in his mind. It was another fifteen minutes before another knock at the parlor door heralded the arrival of Brendilac Brandybuck. ""Horto told me there was a letter for me,"" he began, then stopped, seeing their faces and obviously realizing the import of the attention all were giving him. Sara received the letter from Esmeralda and brought it to place in the lawyer's now reluctant grasp. ""We know it's from Frodo, Brendi,"" he said. ""Did you know he's leaving the Shire?"" he asked. Brendi retreated inside himself, behind the mask of his profession as a lawyer of the Shire. ""I can speak of nothing until the eighth of October,"" he said formally. ""Why didn't you tell us?"" Merimas asked. ""I can speak of nothing until the eighth of October,"" the lawyer repeated. ""Why not?"" demanded Berilac. ""I can speak of nothing until the eighth of October,"" Brendi again repeated, almost desperately. ""Leave it, Beri,"" Mac said, placing a hand on the younger Hobbit's shoulder. ""He's telling you all he's allowed. I take it,"" he directed at the lawyer, ""he's made you swear the oath?"" Brendi nodded, then looked down at the envelope in his hands. They all could see as a tear splashed down on the vellum. Brendi was obviously as full of grief as the rest of those in the room. ""Open it and read it,"" Sara suggested, almost gently. The lawyer did so with fingers that were almost steady, finally unfolding the paper inside and reading silently. He then folded it again, and held it to his breast. ""Oh, Frodo,"" they could hear him say softly. ""Oh, Frodo."" ""Where are we to be on the eighth of October?"" Sara asked finally. ""At Bag End. All are to be at Bag End."" ""For the reading of his will?"" Sara's voice was only just steady. Brendi just looked at him, barred from speaking further by his oath. ""I see,"" the Master said quietly. He gave another sigh. ""Lord Halladan's come to the Bridge along with LordGilfileg and another Ranger. Do you want to go with us to speak with him?"" ""It's best I don't. I can't break my oath, you know."" ""We understand, Brendi,"" Sara answered him. ""We won't devil you further about it, then."" With a wordless look of thanks and relief Brendi retreated. ""Who's with me, then?"" Saradoc said heavily, looking about the room. Within minutes he, Esmeralda, Paladin, and Eglantine, accompanied by Merimac, were on their way to the Bridge Inn."

Frodo-lad's resembled his father's, although they were a bit narrower than Sam's. Aragorn began to follow the tracks, and the rest trailed after him as he went the full span of the stone court, then turned back toward where the tracks started, there in the very center of the square of pavement. Now they spread out, looking down at the evidence someone had lain, curled up on his side here. ""He started on his right side, his right arm somewhat stretched out,"" Aragorn noted. ""Yes,"" Merry said, and such was his tone of voice that all looked to him, seeing the unshed tears of delight and awe in his eyes. ""He used to sleep that way, you know. Certainly he always did when I was a little one, and I'd sleep on his arm and put it to sleep!"" Arwen leaned over and picked up something from the disturbed snow where obviously a Hobbit had lain, then rose and turned. ""Here, melleth nín --how is it the leaves from the White Tree lie here?"" She handed it to her husband, and he turned it in his fingers before gesturing Sam and Frodo-lad to come forward. ""It's not from your White Tree, though,"" Sam said, shaking his head. ""It's larger'n any leaf as I've seen on the tree in the White City."" ""And it's--it's purer, if you take my meaning,"" added his son. The others crowded closer, although they avoided the place where someone had apparently lain in the snow. Pippin reached out to gently stroke it. ""But how could it have come here?"" he asked. Melian had reached to pick up two more leaves, and Eldarion crouched down to carefully lift a dried blossom, rising to show them to the others. ""He was sleeping beneath the White Tree--there--there on Tol Eressëa!"" murmured Merry, his voice tight with emotion. Aragorn swept the courtyard with his gaze. ""There are no footprints leading here, and none would have come here during the storm last night,"" he commented, looking at how the snow had drifted high against the building. ""What are the shapes on the bench?"" asked Melian, indicating the one to which the footprints led. Again avoiding the footprints of the now-missing visitor, they returned to the bench. None touched it. They could easily see where the snow had been scooped from to form the three shapes. ""He used to do this, back at Bag End,"" Sam said, his brow furrowed. ""Every year, the first snowfall, he'd make shapes like these on the garden bench, and would be ever so disappointed-like if'n anyone disturbed them."" ""He did them at Brandy Hall, too,"" Merry agreed. ""First snowfall. Always. Never told me why--only it was something Bilbo told him about."" Aragorn nodded at the information. The shapes seemed familiar, somehow. He'd seen something like the central one. ""That one's definitely a bottle, and I'd say that one's a loaf of bread,"" Frodo-lad said. ""But that one in the middle----"" But the identity of the two side figures had sparked the memory in the Man. ""Haradri!"" he said. ""It's Haradri! There's a custom when the rains begin to fall! They do three mud figures--a monkey, a bottle, and a loaf of bread, although in Haradri tradition they are usually round, not a loaf-shape such as we use. They symbolize the hope for prosperity--or at least freedom from want for food and drink--for the coming year. I saw them during my last trip to Harad, and An'Ankhrabi made his own figures in the garden of the Farozi's house. The longer they last in the rains, the more luck the house is supposed to garner, although they are not to be protected from the weather in any way."" ""But what would Mr. Frodo know of the ways of those folk from Harad afore we left the Shire, even?"" asked Sam, clearly bewildered. But Pippin was starting to smile lopsidedly as he worked it out. ""No--Merry said Frodo told him Bilbo taught him."" ""But how would Old Mr. Bilbo know nothin' about what Southrons do?"" persisted Sam. Pippin raised his eyes from the figures to meet those of the gardener. ""He would have been told by someone who had the chance to know! And I'd place my money on that someone being Isengar Took!"" He wiped more moisture from his hair, smiling as he found a white petal adhering to the back of his hand. He immediately determined to preserve it if he could. Sam looked at him blankly for a moment. ""Isengar Took? Who's--wait! You mean the old mad Took what went off to sail the seas?"" Pippin smiled more broadly. ""Oh, yes--that one. It's said he served as cabin boy on at least one ship--maybe two! He used to tell my grandda about such things as monkeys and all! And Grandda loved the tales, not that he necessarily believed them."" ""Well,"" said Sam. ""Who'd of thunk?"" Indeed, who would have thought of such a custom, there in the Shire? But it was Frodo-lad who found the handprint where the sculptor of snow had steadied himself when he started to slip--the print of the right hand, with one finger clearly missing! ******* He woke beneath the White Tree, sitting up in confusion. Nearby he smelled the odor of pipe smoke. Olórin had taken on the Wizard's shape he'd worn for so long, and he was puffing at his pipe, his head wreathed in smoke rings. He laughed at the sight, and Gandalf paused in his smoking, taking the pipe from his mouth, ""Well--awake at last! And did you enjoy your dreams?"" Very much so! Frodo started to smile and rubbed absently at his head, then stopped, looking in surprise first at his hand and then at his feet. His hand was cold, cold and damp; and in the hair atop his feet could be clearly seen melting snow."

He looked down and gave a slight shrug. ""Few appear to see past the empty sleeve,"" he answered, then returned his gaze to hers almost in challenge. ""Then only those few prove themselves to be truly discerning,"" she said, her head held straighter. He was searching her eyes, then smiling, and she felt her pulses quicken.... ******* She opened the door to the bedchamber assigned her while yet exhilarated by a far more enjoyable evening than she'd foreseen. To find someone she could talk with as she had with the one she'd spent the evening alongside.... ""Well, you have been quite late in returning!"" At her mother's disapproving tone, Lynessë's elation fled. Endorë sat in the chair by the fireplace, her eyes raking her daughter's appearance. ""We had a good deal to speak about, my escort and I."" ""What about your agreement to dance with the Steward's sons?"" ""You asked only that I not refuse to dance with whoever asked me, and I will have you know I did dance with Lord Faramir, shortly before I returned here. He said that anyone who could capture his friend's attention as I did must be one to know better."" ""You could have spent a good deal more time in his presence----"" ""Along with the empty-headed maidens who could simper no more than 'Oh, but how thrilling, Lord Faramir' all evening? At least when he asked me to dance it was because he perceived me not to be but a simple husband seeker!"" ""But what future could you expect with a cripple such as Lord Húrin...?"" Lynessë interrupted her. ""He is not a cripple! He lost his arm honorably in battle in defense of our land, an activity Lord Tervain has never taken part in, much less many others from the southern realm between here and Langstrand! And--wait."" She felt surprise go through her. ""That was Lord Húrin? Our Lord Steward Denethor's nephew? But he should be quite old! He was old when we lived there in Minas Tirith, even."" ""He is not as old, perhaps, as your father, but certainly at least as old as I am. He was one of those present at the first ball I attended when I was sixteen, here at Dol Amroth, in fact. It was during the time Lord Denethor was courting Lady Finduilas."" Lynessë shrugged, confused. ""He does not seem old enough to be of an age with you or Adar."" ""He is of purer Dúnedain blood than we have, Lynessë. Such age more slowly than common Men. Indeed, it is said that of old those who were King often lived to see two centuries, not that many pass a hundred and a score nowadays. Why, our Lord Steward himself must be somewhere around eighty years now."" Lynessë looked thoughtfully toward the door, her distress receding noticeably. ""I see,"" she said. ""He is certainly comely and distinguished enough."" ""Indeed--but you must needs think of yourself now. After all, he is not--whole."" Her daughter looked at her with concern. ""You mean that he was unmanned also?"" Endorë felt herself flush. ""Oh, no--not to my knowledge, at least. Nay, it was but his arm he lost to the Southrons, I believe. But think, sell nín --there is so much one with one arm cannot do----"" ""I have not seen much worth doing he has not shown himself capable of, Naneth. He dances most gracefully, serves others well, can steady one as we walk, and he tells me that he rides and hunts with a spear or hawk."" ""But how can one with one arm hunt while riding?"" Endorë asked uncertainly. ""He rides a horse trained in Rohan to be ridden by horse archers and guided by the knees, or so he told me. He described how it was that his first such steed was a gift given him by his captain from when he was in the Rangers of Ithilien."" ""Oh."" The mother paused in thought. ""But I had such hopes you might come to the Citadel as a bride...."" Lynessë was flushing with anger. ""Always you would see me in the Citadel! Perhaps I do not wish such a high estate. Look at what occurred when it was the Lady Finduilas came there. Save for her sons, what joy did she find in being the Lord Steward's Lady?"" ""Do not say that--she loved her husband dearly!"" ""Perhaps."" The younger woman's anger relaxed. ""Nay, she must have loved him to leave Dol Amroth and go with him to the capital and become his wife. But all have told me she did not fare well, ever in the sight of the Enemy's stronghold, and seeing the weight of cares increasingly burden her husband."" ""You are stronger than she!"" ""Am I, Nana?"" Endorë straightened. ""Oh, yes, but you are. Do not question that, daughter. Now, you must rest."" ""Not until I am free of this gown--which is another matter--I shall never wear it again! It is too tight, and it has been all I could do to move or sit--or even breathe! If you will call for Tersiel...."" Again flushing, the older woman shook her head. ""I already sent her to bed. And I can certainly help you out of this gown, beloved."" So saying, she moved to undo the laces, only to realize just how tight they were, and to see firsthand the relief in her daughter's face and posture once the dress was finally loose and pulled over her head and away. Lynessë took a long, relieved breath. ""Thanks be to the Powers!"" she sighed, stretching. ""Never, never again will I wear it, or even see it. So, take it away, Nana, or I shall throw it out into the Sundering Sea to be rid of it!"" Endorë carried it away, held protectively over her arm. Had it done its job, she wondered? Time would tell."

""I've heard that one so many times over the years--and once by old Odo Proudfoot tellin' that to his great granddaughter Cyclamen. Now, if that wasn't a shock to hear. Cyclamen knew well enough as she was the lass in the statue and that it was her cousin Frodo's lap as she was sittin' on. Odo couldn't of missed as it was Frodo's face as he was lookin' at. Last time as he went to the Fair--died a month later, sittin' on the stoop, his pipe in his hand."" ""Does Master Ruvemir still make statues for the King, do you think?"" asked Dahlia. Sam's face grew sad, for he'd truly liked the stunted Man. ""No, Master Ruvemir died a few years past, there in Gondor in Minas Anor, in the Houses of Healin'. Lord Strider hisself carried him there, was by him till he took his last breath. Told me last time as I seen him that each time he must lose a close friend it gets harder, though he knows in time he'll find us all again."" He looked up and out the window that looked over the garden, his eyes thoughtful. ""Got many of the advantages of bein' of Elven blood, he has, but some of the disadvantages as well. Has to watch so many of us go ahead of him, know he has to wait years till he'll come where we'll be waitin'."" Lily found herself trading glances with her mother, then watching her father. Her dad was watching her grandfather with a good deal of concern, realizing that the day Sam must leave Bag End and the Shire loomed ever closer now. Then she looked at her grandmother, and saw the compassion and surprising serenity in Rose Gamgee's face as she looked at her beloved husband. Two days later Frodo, Lily, and the four children who lived at home yet set off in the wagon for Michel Delving, calling out that they'd look for the arrival of the patriarchs of the clan on Midsummer Day. Shortly after they left, Silman Chubbs arrived and spoke with both Sam and Rosie, gave each a brief yet nonetheless thorough examination, and then sat them down in the parlor for a talking to. ""You're both getting on in years,"" he commented. ""Unfortunately, that's not something as I can do much about. Can't say as how long either of you has, but it probably won't be all that much longer--maybe a few months--even a few weeks; maybe a few years yet. There's no saying. But you shouldn't ought to try staying on your own, you realize. If one of you should fall and break a hip or something like it could be very serious."" Sam and Rosie traded glances. ""Hadn't thought of the possibility of that,"" Sam said slowly. Silman sighed and gave a nod. ""I'll stop and talk to Hamfast as I go down the Hill, have him arrange for one of the family to stay with you while Frodo and his family are gone to the Free Fair. Are you going, too?"" ""We're drivin' over in a trap in a few days time."" ""Glad as you're wise enough not to try to ride, Mr. Sam, sir,"" Silman said with some approval. ""But you should be fine for that."" After he left, Sam went out and sat on the bench by the front door, feeling somewhat resentful and unsettled. This, he realized, was part of what Frodo had felt his last couple years in the Shire--the knowledge he was diminished and would lose more before it was all over. Although it was worse for Frodo, knowing that he'd come to this point long before a Hobbit ought to begin fading. He'd never known the joys and pleasures of marriage and seeing his children born and grown. He'd never grumbled over the yards and yards of cloth that must be purchased to see his family decently clothed at the same time in his heart he felt such pride to have so wonderful a set of children needing to be clad. Sam took a deep, sighing breath, and felt the catch in his chest that he knew well enough indicated he was indeed coming closer and closer by the day to the end. He looked out at the Shire below him under the slanting light of the afternoon Sun, and found himself almost overwhelmed by longing again, the longing to go the quays of the Grey Havens and step aboard that grey ship that would take him in search of his Master. At last he rose and went inside. (I) (I) (I) He woke on the morning of Midsummer and felt as if something were missing. What it could be he couldn't say. He sat up and looked down where Rosie lay beside him, and he smiled and reached out to her--only to discover that as she'd slept Rosie Cotton Gamgee Gardner had slipped out of her body and begun her own journey West. No breath lifted that gentle bosom; no warmth radiated from her hand; no blood stirred in her cheek. He looked up and briefly felt he saw her looking back at him, from there near the hearth where the little statue of Frodo sitting on the bench by the door sat. You're free now to seek him out, Samwise Gamgee. Use well the days, and then come to me, both of you. Remember what I told you as I wanted, love. Shocked and bereft once again in his life, Sam remained sitting in the bed, looking toward where her image had faded. ""Gaffer?"" called Hamfast from the doorway. ""When shall I go and fetch the trap?"" ""Send to Michel Delving, and have whoever's there come home,"" Sam said, his voice surprisingly calm, he thought, listening to himself. ""Have them come. Your gammer's died."""
414,2,20,2-Larner-20.txt,lord-of-the-rings,Larner,"come again, and his hands are those of the healer, and so we have known the rumors true."" ""I was told that the captain of those who had come, the Northern captain who came off the black ships--that he had called our Lord Faramir back from the Gates themselves. My son--they brought him up from the great Gate of the City after the Black Captain turned away when the horns sounded--he had fallen under the Black Breath. They found no hurt on him, you see, so they would not take him to the Houses, thinking there was nothing to be done. He has been sinking deeper and deeper into the darkness all this day. The Captain--he called him back! He called him back with his will and the touch of his hand and the vapors of Kingsfoil. I never understood why my wife grew it in the garden, but he saw it and gave thanks for it, took some leaves and healed my son! "" ""And this one is a Man?"" Húrin could not help but press the still stunned father for the truth of this one. ""A Man? Well, he certainly is no orc!"" ""I mean, he is no Elf?"" The father shook his head in disgust at the question. ""I had not thought any Elves yet remained in the world until I saw the one who walked by the King--now, that is an Elf, with beardless visage, unnatural beauty, ageless eyes. But the King--he's definitely a Man--and a Dúnadan!"" The excitement he felt was growing almost too large to hold in his heart as Húrin turned to continue the search. Near dawn he found the party at last, in the Second Circle in the common room to the Inn of the King's Head, where many of those who'd been injured had been brought who were too weak to be taken up to the Houses, not that there was room for any of these there. He saw the Elf first, kneeling over a pallet on which a Man had been laid, his form fair shining with a discernible Light. But not that far away knelt a second form that also seemed to glow, although the Light surrounding this one was different in quality, for it was not steady but pulsed as does the light of stars as opposed to the light of the wandering planets. Over still more of the wounded knelt others, some in the garb of Healers and some in the livery of the apothecaries and herbalists, and many of them those who'd only come to assist as they could. Water and broth were being administered; and here, too, he could smell an odor of cleanliness and renewal, familiar and yet peculiar to this place. He approached the one with the pulsing Light surrounding him... The one on the pallet was whispering, ""I could not find my way..."" ""Shh, my friend--you have now been found and are back with us. Rest now and find your healing. These others will minister to you as they can."" ""Thank you,"" the injured Man said, reaching out to grasp the wrist of the one who knelt over him, momentarily keeping him from rising. ""Thank you for lighting the way back!"" The healer smiled down at him, although it could be seen he was exhausted. ""Rest now, child of Eru. Rest and grow strong."" So saying he slipped his wrist free of the other and rose and turned. Húrin saw first the depths of the exhaustion felt and the pain that this one kept suppressed. Not pain of body, he realized; no, this one had been scoured by grief, and was now tired enough to fall into his bed and perhaps sleep the following day and night. The Elf was approaching the Man, his own fair face concerned. ""Estel, you must now go and rest."" ""These need me, Elrohir."" ""Nonsense, muindor nín . Not even you can take personal responsibility for all. I am fresher than you and can take over with those who remain here. Go--go out to your tent and rest. Halladan has seen to its raising."" ""I am still needed."" ""I tell you, younger brother, that you will be more sorely needed in a few hours' time, and you will need to have your body rested and your mind clear."" The Elf turned to one of the Men who'd only just risen from giving a drink to one of the injured. ""Hardorn--take this stubborn kinsman of yours out to the tents and see to it he gets at least four hours' sleep--and be certain you do likewise."" The Elf reached out to take the water bottle from the one he'd addressed as Hardorn. ""With pleasure, Lord Elrohir. Aragorn?"" That was less a question, Húrin thought, than a command. Nevertheless, the Gondorian lord stepped forward, and the Man Hardorn interposed himself between him and the one who--might be--King. ""If you have an injured kinsman you wish seen to, speak with Lord Elrohir here rather than to my cousin--he has labored mightily for days to see that in the end this City might be defended, and we are all grieving for our own losses as well as those known here in Gondor."" Here, too, was indeed grief that was at the moment being channeled into protection for this one. And as he looked into the Man's face Húrin felt the stirrings of recognition. But the other put his hand on Hardorn's shoulder-- Hardorn--but he knew that name--from long ago! And the face seemed familiar! ""Peace, Hardorn."" And that, too, was familiar. Húrin searched the Man's eyes--and suddenly the scales fell away. A shock went through him--a shock of recognition as well as mingled dismay and yet gladness beyond what he'd ever expected to feel. "" Thorongil !"" he breathed, finding he had not the wind to shout as he'd intended. And he understood! The King? Ah, but he'd wondered that so long ago, when this one had last been in Gondor!"
415,2,3,2-Larner-3.txt,lord-of-the-rings,Larner,"us?"" demanded the wights. ""I am the King Elessar Envinyatar Telcontar!"" proclaimed Aragorn. ""Do you wish to be freed from the bindings that brought and hold you here?"" The response was almost a shriek of derision and rage. ""You are mere mortals!"" one of the wights challenged. ""You have no authority over us!"" ""Perhaps so, or perhaps you are wrong. I ask again—would you be freed from what binds you here?"" ""Free to do what?"" ""Perhaps free to be as you were intended?"" suggested the King. ""I have examined the spells set about this place, spells intended to protect those who pass by the barrows. Those spells were not designed to hold any against their wills, not as long as they did not display a will to harm any outside of this place. If you are willing to lay aside evil intentions, you may go where you please."" A lesser wight pushed past the one who'd taken the role of spokesman. ""Do you mean that we can perhaps leave the bounds of Arda?"" it whined. Was there a hint of hope in that question? ""Do you wish to return to the Timeless Halls? I cannot say for certain what awaits you once you leave the Barrow-downs, but certainly it cannot be worse than what you've known for the past two thousand years, can it? Are you willing to lay aside your will to evil?"" He focused his attention solely on the smaller spirit. There was an incomprehensible rumble about them. It appeared that the wights were debating amongst themselves as to what they ought to do. The five mortals watched about themselves warily, but with growing confidence. Sometimes they could clearly see shapes forming here or there, but then those shapes would as quickly dissolve again into swirling mist. At first they oft saw slavering fangs and burning eyes; but as the debate continued the shapes became more generally similar to the bodies of the Children of Ilúvatar, and the distortions began to diminish. At one point the howling became piercing in its intensity, and again the air grew cold, almost as if winter were ready to take hold of the land about them in spite of the fact they were approaching the summer solstice. Pippin raised Trollsbane, his guard intensified. Another voice answered the howl, calmer but still powerful, and in time the general cacophony began to reflect that voice's tone. At last all began to go still. Again forms became visible around them, no longer visions out of nightmares, but instead shapes that were more similar to the forms of Elves, Men, Dwarves, and Hobbits, some with a ruined beauty, some laughably ugly, but all of them—tired. ""We would indeed be freed from our bonds,"" one of the wights told them. ""Including the bonds of anger and hatred?"" asked the Lord Elessar. For a moment there was quiet, but then, from all sides they could hear the word echoed, ""Yes."" It was not a shout, but instead sounded almost like exhausted acceptance. The eyes they could discern were watchful, but in many of them they saw an almost desperate hope growing. ""If you mean it,"" Aragorn said. He gathered to himself the power of the Elessar stone upon his breast, and began again to sing the song Frodo had been singing in the dream. He envisioned in his heart the image of the Army of the Dead, the Oathbreakers, as they'd stood before him at Pelargir, their mission accomplished, their oaths at last fulfilled, and he sang similar Freedom for these. Pippin joined the song, then Merry, followed by Sam; and at last Arwen's descant rose above the other voices. It was a symphony of Hope Returned, of Victory, of Change. Then a new voice was heard as a wight stepped forward and joined the singing, its voice growing increasingly pleasant as it sang. Its shape began to change again, and it lost the darkness that had been discernible in it a moment before. It grew brighter, brighter and more beautiful—and then it rose up, glorious and joyful, turned at an angle away from everything, and- -And it was gone! The tiredness fell away from a few others, and now they stepped forward as had the first. They joined the singing, and the same transformation could be seen in them. More began to follow. Some followed the first out of Arda; others merely grew brighter and then appeared to fade from sight. More and more joined the singing, until at last all had been changed—or so it seemed to the five mortals. No—there remained at least a few dark spirits there, although not much more than a single handful. But surrounding them could be sensed a large number of bright entities who appeared intent on herding the dark ones into the furthest reaches of the ancient cemetery. One of these bright ones made itself nearly visible. Not all of us will leave this place, they heard in their hearts, not as long as those refuse to give over the anger that our ancient Master taught them. But we thank you! We had forgotten how to hear the Song, and you have taught us to hear It once more and to join in It again. And we thank you for that! They felt as if hands had been laid on each of them in blessing, and then they were alone. (I) From the top of the Tor Iarwain watched, a smile on his lips. ""It's done,"" he exulted. ""And the old barrows are not all deserted, but no longer all given over to dark spirits! And it seems that a few will remain, not dark but bright, to keep the fences…."" And then, putting that out of his mind, Tom began singing, dancing his way across the hilltop, heading to the heart of his land, back to the company of his lady once more. And the pupa split unnoticed, and a caddis fly spread its shining wings to dry."
416,2,18,2-Larner-18.txt,lord-of-the-rings,Larner,"Gandalf murmured as he blessed the old Hobbit, kissed his hair, and drew a blanket over him as he drowsed. (I) (I) (I) He awoke with his plan in hand. The only way that they had come upon in Frodo's youth that had managed to allow him to express his discomforts - his angers, his frustrations, his confusions - had been to coax him to write it out. Master Tumnus, lessons master at Brandy Hall when Frodo was a youngster, had been the first to realize this. He had presented Frodo with a journal one day about a year after his parents had died, and had told him that a part of his educational requirements from that day forward was that he was to write in his journal for at least fifteen minutes a day. The first entries had made Tumnus share them, laughing, with Bilbo at his next visit. Master Tumnus says I must write in this for fifteen minutes. How boring. I am writing in this journal. I am writing in this journal. I am writing in this journal. I am writing in this... And the sentence had been copied repeatedly seventy-six times, although after the fiftieth repetition apparently Frodo had become bored, and had begun experimenting with how he presented the letters; embellishing some with serifs and flourishes, others with capitals and lower case letters reversed, several of them written right to left instead of left to right, some in increasingly smaller lettering, and the last two with letters so large that it took an entire page per sentence. The second entry had included the words to three very crude drinking songs he'd learned from Merimas Brandybuck. The third started with a description of Master Tumnus from the mole on his cheek which sported two long hairs to the fact his foot tapped incessantly when he was reading, as if he were tapping out the rhythm of the words had they been spoken. This led into a discussion of how unfair he was to bore his students with meaningless drivel such as this. The fourth was an imagined dialogue between Master Tumnus and his wife about whether or not they would prepare a flaming pudding for the Yule feast, a dialogue which had been quite witty. It was in the eighth entry that Frodo began to write out his anger at an older lad who'd called him an orphan in such a tone of voice that it was plainly meant as an insult and accusation of sorts, and after that his entries became more expressions of how he was feeling on any particular day. He had also written some character sketches of particular individuals within the Hall, several of them distinctly unflattering, others quite sensitive and thoughtful. Tumnus Brandybuck had managed to find where the lad hid this journal and read it from time to time, stopping only when Bilbo threatened to take the matter up with Master Rorimac. But he insisted that Frodo was less troubled when he wrote in the journals, as they gave him an outlet for his feelings, and he kept up his insistence the lad continue to do his writings as long as Tumnus remained lessons master. Frodo had been presented a new journal about once every eight months or so during Tumnus's tenure; after that Frodo had begun buying replacements at the Bridge Market when they were needed. But when he left the Hall he'd been found by his cousin Saradoc Brandybuck burning his last journal, declaring he never wished to cause ill feelings through what he wrote; and he'd brought none away with him to Hobbiton and Bag End. Bilbo had realized this might be a useful ploy to use on Frodo again, and so about a year after Frodo came to live in Bag End he'd purchased the stationery box and its attendant pieces that had sat on a desk in Frodo's room, and had insisted he use them, allowing him a means to ensure privacy. It had proven difficult on more than one occasion to resist the temptation to tamper with the relatively simple lock, but Bilbo had managed to school himself, realizing that if he was to trust his ward, Frodo would need to first accept he could trust his guardian. It had paid off handsomely, giving Frodo a needed outlet for his feelings in keeping with his nature, and the tween had managed to get through the rest of his transition to mature Hobbit with a measure of grace which had delighted his nominal uncle. Would a similar ploy work now? Bilbo found himself wondering. He rather thought it might, and certainly the reasons for presenting the idea to Frodo were more than sufficiently valid, not to mention obvious. He'd hoped to be able to write down the story of his younger cousin's adventures himself, not fully admitting to himself till he saw Frodo again that so much of it had been sheer torture. If he could convince Frodo to write it out himself - might that not assist Frodo to get it out of his system somewhat? It had helped him in dealing with Lobelia and her gossip mongering and lies well enough - not that her nastiness was more than the palest of shadows of what Frodo had just survived. He'd snapped back to wakefulness to hear Sam commenting that it looked as if Bilbo was unlikely to finish writing the story of their experiences, had at first felt insulted, then upset to realize this was true, but finally realized this was the perfect moment to suggest Frodo do it instead. He realized he was laying in on a bit thick, playing on the drops into sleep to make it look as if his wits were also somewhat affected as well, but it had worked. Now, if only the dear lad would actually follow through and write it out... He found himself praying to the Valar they would find ways to bring this about."
417,2,6,2-Larner-6.txt,lord-of-the-rings,Larner,"second darkness began to dissipate. But the dark flames were still there. Only they were now within Sam's phial as well as in Frodo's. (I) (I) (I) The days had been growing darker in the outer world, and Sauron's power grew greater and greater as his war progressed. The Elves of Rivendell did not quail, however. No, they grew in resolve even as the clouds grew thicker and more oppressive overhead. The songs of the Elves, which long ago Bilbo had considered as bordering upon being silly, were now louder and filled with images of Light ranged against the darkness intent on covering all. And he found himself singing the songs of his own people in his personal defiance of that darkness, and saw Elrond and his closest advisors and the Lady Arwen all smiling on him with approval. Until the moment the darkness flagged, and for a day or two west winds tore away the unnatural clouds that had sought to darken the whole of Middle Earth. (I) (I) (I) Frodo was apparently free of direct danger, and once again his Light and Sam's were in concert. Except—except that now it was more often Sam's Light that directed and augmented Frodo's rather than the other way around as had been true before the advent of that second darkness. Frodo's Light and the dark flames were more equal within Frodo's phial, and the dark flames were growing steadily stronger. But that rod of Frodo's Light that the darkness could not touch might have been growing more slender but also was continuing to grow in intensity, although the level of intensity was not rising as rapidly as had been true before. Outside the House of Elrond the days again grew darker, and the light of torches shone from edges of drawn swords and shining arrow tips. Only Bilbo was within the room when Frodo's phial again flared, and he saw the battle between dark flames and Frodo's Light, and it appeared that this time the dark flames would triumph- But at the last the tinge of greyness returned, and unexpectedly took the dark flames to itself. The greyness thrust itself away from Frodo's Light, and in a confusing morass of dark flames it fell, touched a great red fire, and—and was gone, along with the dark flames, all consumed by the red fire! Arwen entered the room just as the grey tinge reappeared, and swiftly stood behind Bilbo, clutching at his shoulders and supporting him, although her grip of her fingers grew painful as the flask reflecting Aragorn's Light flared in defiance, as did those of all other remaining members of the Fellowship! Frodo's Light and Sam's grew brighter for a time, pulsing more and more together, then slowly but inexorably began to dim. Pippin's Light also began to dwindle. The dark flames were gone, and they knew that Sauron had been defeated, that his Ring was destroyed. But what had been the grey tinge they'd seen, and how had it managed to take away the dark flames? Elrond was kneeling beside Bilbo, whose eyes were dimmed with tears and who felt all through himself a shocking weakness such as he'd not known since he'd been struck senseless during the Battle of Five Armies. ""It is done, Bilbo,"" Elrond was murmuring into the old Hobbit's ear. ""It is done! The Ring is destroyed, and the power we have known is now shorn. Frodo has survived, although I cannot tell you how. But he may not choose to remain. Can you deny him his desire to rest, should he choose to leave the Bounds of Arda?"" Bilbo could not answer, and at last he turned away from the sight of Frodo's phial, and wept into Elrond's robes, feeling the peredhel's answering tears dampen his scalp. (I) (I) (I) Frodo's Light did not fade away altogether, although the embers at the heart of his phial and that of Sam pulsed and nearly died several times over the first few days. But both responded to the Lights of Gandalf and Aragorn, as did the dimmed Light of Peregrin Took. When he was awake, Bilbo rejoiced to see these three Lights strengthen day by day. But the magic that powered the phials was weakening. He knew that Frodo, Sam, and Pippin yet lived, but as Arwen prepared for the departure of her bridal train it was less and less obvious what might be occurring wherever it was that the Fellowship now gathered. Bilbo found himself constantly drifting off into increasingly frequent dozes. He had to recognize that he'd been much supported to this time by the power of the Ring, no matter that he'd given It over into Frodo's keeping so long before. The great weariness that now took power over him upset him not because he feared it, but because he did not wish to fail Frodo. In the end he chose to remain behind as Arwen and her father set off southward to Gondor. The phials had been removed to Bilbo's bedroom, and on Midsummer Day he saw a clear shining of Light in all the phials, but especially those of Aragorn, Frodo, and Sam as Aragorn and Arwen were married. (I) (I) (I) Several weeks after Elrond, accompanied by Bilbo and the Lady Galadriel, headed westward toward the Grey Havens, at nightfall Lindir came at last into the Hobbit's former rooms to begin seeing them cleared. The nine phials stood on Bilbo's mantel where they'd remained since Arwen left her father's house, and all were now apparently empty of Light. But, as he approached the mantel he saw three of those flasks suddenly shine anew—those associated with Sam Gamgee, Aragorn son of Arathorn, and Frodo Baggins. That last shone with the greatest brightness it had ever displayed, and Lindir realized that the ship that bore his former Lord away from Middle Earth had just found the Straight Path, and that soon Elrond, Galadriel, Bilbo, and Frodo would be in their new Home."

Directions were given to where they'd disposed of the body, and it was verified that indeed this was no true Man who was buried there."" ""So, he won't be able to kill anyone else?"" ""No, he cannot do so again. He is dead, and by the hands of those who saw daily how dangerous he was."" Evro swallowed. ""Then I can tell Agata that he won't ever come back again and it will be true!"" Frodo smiled. ""Yes."" ""And you know that the story you told tonight is a true one?"" Frodo's expression became solemn and withdrawn. ""Yes, as truly as I can tell it."" ""But it's not the whole story."" Frodo looked down at the backs of his hands, and Evro could see the place where one of the older Hobbit's fingers was missing, just as he'd been told. ""I don't think,"" he said, his tone measured and thoughtful, ""that any story can truly be told completely. We tell what we know, what we understand, what we saw; but our eyes cannot see everything or our memories hold all of the details. And, whether or not we realize it, each one adds his own understandings to the story he tells and leaves out those bits that don't fit with his way of telling it. That is simply the way we who are considered the Children of Ilúvatar must act."" ""Your stories aren't like they used to be, there before you left the Shire."" ""I know."" ""Why?"" Again Frodo lifted his eyes to meet the lad's. ""I now have seen battle and death. I have watched horrors you cannot appreciate—that I hope you never need to appreciate. You think of the Troubles as the worst things imaginable, and that is true—for you and all of those who lived through them here within the Shire. We left, hoping that by doing so we were protecting the Shire, that we would draw the danger after us. But we could only fight the evil creatures we could see, and there are far, far more evil beings in the world than we could hope to know. Not all were interested in following after us, but were set upon their own plans. I never dreamed that my Cousin Lotho had allied himself with the likes of Sharkey and his creatures! Who could have known that his desire to become important and powerful within the Shire would involve him agreeing to allow a fallen Wizard's mercenaries to enter the Shire and rampage around it? ""But know this—far, far worse would have happened had we not gone when we did. And because we fought the Enemy where and how we did, much evil has departed Middle Earth for good. But it is not the end of all evil—it is the evil in our own hearts we must fight from now on. Gandalf tells us that the war was won successfully only because each and every race was—finally—united in opposing the great Enemy. And if it had not been for Bilbo's actions so long ago in going to Erebor and serving as an example of integrity and fairness, I doubt that many within the wilderlands east of the Misty Mountains would have realized that all must stand together this time that they not all be destroyed piecemeal. ""You saw the dark clouds that kept people from seeing the Sun, Moon, and Stars for weeks. The dark was far deeper where we were, and as each of us fought the Enemy as we must. And the Light shines the brighter for us because we have known that darkness. ""And among those who fought were heroes of the Shire, tough as old briars as they faced down wights, orcs, goblins, trolls, the Balrog, the Black Riders, Shelob, and the great Enemy himself and his artifice."" Evro didn't know what else to say. He was surprised to find he didn't feel gladness for the death of the Big Man who'd killed his brother, only relief that he couldn't hurt or kill anyone else. And looking deeply into Frodo's eyes, he realized the Baggins understood. He was more surprised to find he was crying, and suddenly Frodo slipped off the chair where he'd been sitting and knelt, drawing Evro to him and holding him while the lad wept, and much of Evro's anger and fear left him. Why he felt safe in Frodo's arms he could not later say, but he was so glad for it at the time. At last his tears were spent, and he drew back, and Frodo produced a handkerchief from his vest pocket (""Bilbo always insisted I never should go anywhere without plenty of handkerchiefs,"" he murmured as he wiped Evro's face and let him blow his nose), and afterwards Evro felt much better and half as heavy as he'd felt ever since he saw his brother die. Evro smiled his thanks, his smile rather watery, he suspected, and left Frodo, who'd risen and watched after him. The last Evro saw as he pulled the door closed as he left was Frodo sitting back down in the chair by the fire, reaching again for his mug of water. (I) (I) (I) Letters from Bag End in Hobbiton arrived the last week of September, and word swiftly spread that Frodo Baggins had again left the Shire with no warning, for good this time. The Master and Mistress and many others from Brandy Hall went to Hobbiton in early October to hear Frodo's will read, and when they returned they were accompanied by the Thain and his family, and another Hobbit most of the residents of Brandy Hall had not met personally—Samwise Gamgee, who came with his wife and baby daughter. The children of the Hall looked upon him openmouthed and followed him everywhere. And Sam appeared surprised when little Agata smiled up at him to show that she was missing a front tooth on the top and lisped, ""I know you! You're Cousin Frodo's hero!"""
419,2,1,2-Larner-1.txt,lord-of-the-rings,Larner,"West has already accepted--that without the actions and choices of Frodo Baggins there would be no Shire for us to dwell in! "" ""But he didn't want to be Mayor in his own right----"" began the family head to the Gravellies. Frodo Gamgee-Gardener stood up then beside his dad. ""It wasn't he didn't want to be Mayor--it's that he couldn't do it any more. It almost killed him, taking the Ring to Mordor, all the way to the Mountain itself! Don't you realize what the Thain is saying? It scoured him out--right to the bottom of his heart! He almost lost himself, and was losing more every day. He was living with nightmares the likes of which the rest of us will never know! His shoulder ached almost constantly at times, and he knew terrible headaches. It was hard to eat, and harder to find rest. He had to go, or he'd have just crept into the furthest, darkest storeroom in Bag End and have died. ""Don't you understand? He didn't leave the Shire for himself--he left it for you --for all of us! And when the Shire treated him like he'd done nothing at all and as if he were an embarrassing freak of nature, he finally left Middle Earth for good--and I say it was the right thing to do!"" The rest of the family heads and their heirs and aides looked at one another as the young Hobbit sat down audibly on his chair, still glaring across the room at the Gravelly. ""You're mighty young to be talking so to your elders and betters,"" commented the Smallburrow family head. Will Whitfoot, somewhat frail but still hale enough, rose stiffly from where he sat, and leaned heavily on his stick. ""It's only the truth, though. You just don't realize what Frodo managed to do as deputy Mayor. You still think about the only thing as the Mayor does is to officiate at banquets and weddings. But Lotho and Sharkey and their Big Men--they'd left the entire Shire in an awful way. If we hadn't had Frodo there to take over and set everything in order so as we could figure out how it had been done and all, we'd still be fighting to get things put right! All four of the Travelers helped us put the Shire back together--Captains Merry and Pippin cleaned out the ruffians, Sam Gamgee saw the Shire made green again and our homes rebuilt, and Frodo Baggins saw the secrets brought out and the real villains exposed, and our laws and possessions restored to those they belonged to. ""And you didn't see Frodo working when he really ought to have been in a dark room with a cloth soaked in cold lavender water across his eyes. You didn't see the pain he'd hide when his shoulder was aching where he'd been wounded. You didn't see the scars he hid...."" He shook his head, and let himself drop back into his seat. Benlo Bracegirdle now stood up. ""I say that if the King wants us here in the Shire to agree with the rest of the folk about that Frodo Baggins is indeed a Lord of all the Free Peoples, then let's do it."" One of the Broadbelts commented, ""It's not as if it really means anything, after all. And if the King's for it, and the Master and the Mayor and the Thain...."" ******* As they walked back to Bag End together, each tucked securely under his umbrella, Peregrin Took handed Samwise Gamgee the pages on which the Mayor had written the song. ""There, Sam. And I'm not the least ashamed of having taken it, you know."" Frodo-lad shook his head. ""But even though most of them will vote for it and even convince their families to vote for it, still most of them think Uncle Frodo only went out of the Shire for a lark. They don't really believe."" Sam looked down on his son with a wry smile. ""No, them don't, and that's a fact. But a few does--and that few is what's important. Now--what, do you suppose, as your mother's fixed for luncheon? I think as I could eat an entire oliphaunt on my own, and that's sayin' a lot!"" Yes, that was saying a great deal indeed! --~o0o~-- And now, particularly for Dreamflower, the following: Beer Batter Pancakes Ingredients · 1/2-1 Cup Beer (Lager, Pilsner) or use stout for darker appearing, denser pancakes and of course a richer flavour · 1/2-1 Cup Milk (Soy is nice too) · 1-2 Egg slightly beaten · 1-2 Cup Flour (White, Whole Wheat or mixture-depending upon consistency) · 1 tsp Baking Powder (or Soda) · 2 tbsp Oil · Pre Heated Frying Pan (350-400 degrees)-drops of water bounce or sizzle-cast iron is traditional-electric griddle is very nice Directions Beat egg(s) slightly in large bowl (eggs make the batter denser) use whites only for ultra light mixture Add 1/2-1 Cup Beer (depending upon thickness you desire) Add 1/2-1 Cup Milk (again, consistency and thickness) Separately sift flour and Baking Powder Slowly add flour mixture to liquid until slightly runny-don't over-mix-leave lumpy Wipe hot frying pan with oil after each batch (use a lint free cloth that is wet with oil)-if brown 'skin' of pancake remains, scrape it off Spoon or Pour Mixture into pan. Ideally, with enough space around each pancake to allow for expansion and flipping-use a measuring cup if you are adamant about symmetry Fry pancakes until mixture bubbles in centre and is slightly brown on edge--try not to overcook as this is the chance to keep the pancake light and fluffy Stack them up, put a pat of butter on top and drizzle maple syrup or home made topping of diced pear or apple with skin on browned in butter and brown sugar with water to make a syrup (adults use pear or apple vodka to enhance the fruit)-go crazy with a little whipped cream for the kids-everyone will love these!

I had the occasional beer with the guys at work. Maybe a football or hockey game on the weekend. I saw Jasper and Alice when their busy schedules permitted, but always feeling like the extra man out, no matter how they tried to include me. I spent the majority of my time alone. Until she entered my life I hadn't realized how lonely I really was. I would give up nothing and I would have her. ""I have it all planned. I'm going to go back to Chicago, quit my job and move here—I've been unhappy lately and a small town sounds good. I'm going to meet this sexy little waitress and fall in love and we're going to build a life together. No one will know any different."" I tightened my grip on her face. ""I'm not giving anything up, Bella. I'm gaining everything with you."" ""If—"" I shook my head. ""If something happens, we go together. Esme seems to feel the danger has passed. We'll take it one step at a time. Together. With Esme watching and me beside you; you're safe. I'll protect you."" ""I can't believe this is real."" ""It is. You're not alone anymore, Bella. Neither of us are."" Tears poured down her face, and my own cheeks were damp. ""I love you, Edward."" ""I love you."" My mouth covered hers in the sweetest of kisses. One of welcome, of promises for the future. Our future. The next day, I walked her to the restaurant, planning on leaving her there and going to do some errands. She still loved to walk, and today my step was much lighter with her tucked into my side. We had talked more, cried more and finally exhausted, collapsed together in bed, holding each other all night, both of us feeling content when we woke up wrapped together tight. It was exactly how I wanted to wake up the rest of my life. Once at the door, I leaned down and kissed her tenderly. ""I'll be back to pick you up at eight. Right?"" She nodded; her eyes anxious and her teeth buried in her bottom lip. ""I'll be here."" ""Okay."" She disappeared through the door and I turned to leave, but I only made it a few steps before the tugging in my chest got too much. I felt the fluttering of panic simply at the thought of walking away from her, even though I knew I'd see her in a few hours. I hesitated and then gave in and turned around. With a heavy sigh, I pushed open the door and found her right inside. One look at her face and I knew she was feeling the same panic as me. I pulled her into my arms and nuzzled her hair. ""I think I need coffee and to sit here for a while."" ""Yeah,"" she breathed. ""Maybe some pie?"" ""Definitely pie."" ""Okay,"" she smiled. I winked at her, feeling better. ""Okay, Annabella ."" After a little while, I was able to leave her. I stayed busy, finding my way around the small town and gathering everything I needed. When I arrived to pick her up, she was by the window, watching for me. I smiled in understanding. It would be a long time before we were comfortable being apart from one another. We walked home in the dark, looking around at the Christmas lights. She gasped softly when her little house came into view. I had added some lights around the door, and some evergreens underneath the windows, making it look festive. Inside, she exclaimed in delight at the little spruce tree I'd bought, and we decorated it together. She cried again when I handed her the ornament I remembered to bring with me and together we hung it on the tree. She smiled and laughed over the big springs of mistletoe I had hung in all the doorways. I used every excuse I could think of to catch her under them all night and kiss her. I never wanted to stop kissing her. We brought the Christmas ball wreath inside and hung it over the mantle again. Bella admitted she hung it on the door after sending me the forks, hoping I would come to town and look for her. She knew I would know that wreath anywhere, and if I made it to town, I would know I'd found her when I saw our wreath. But now it was inside, a memory of our first Christmas. The start of our life together. I sat on the sofa, my arm around her, staring at the little tree we decorated, the lights glinting off our beautiful wreath, reflecting on how different I felt compared to a week ago. I had been dreading this holiday season, the memories of the happy one shared with her last year too fresh. I was unhappy, empty, and alone. Now I was reunited with her. No longer alone or empty. The love I had for her—that we had for each other—filled up all the emptiness and circled around us like a living, breathing thing. With her I was home. I nuzzled her hair and breathed her in. ""I only have tomorrow to do my shopping, Bella. What do you want for Christmas?"" She looked up, a contented smile on her face. ""I already got the best gift. I got you."" ""We got each other."" ""Then there isn't anything more I need."" I captured her lips with mine, kissing her deeply. She was right. It was the best gift of them all. ""Merry Christmas, baby."" She snuggled closer. ""Merry Christmas, Edward."" Hosts Note: Please leave the author some love by submitting a review.

Loving a dying person is the stupidest thing ever."" ""Nothing will change my feelings. I may not have a lot of time to show you that I love you, so I'm not wasting another second. You love me, too."" I roll my eyes, but he's right. I mean, of course he's right. Loving him is nothing new to me, but telling him? That's pretty frightening. He should probably distance himself from me because I don't want to hurt him, but from the look in his eyes, I know it's too late for that. It's too late to lie or hide. ""Of course I love you,"" I say as he grins. ""This is really, really awful timing, though."" ""But it's not too late."" No, it's not. Even if I only have a day left, a day of loving Edward and knowing he loves me is enough. Falling in love wasn't on my bucket list, but it's happened. I don't know why and I'm not going to question it. ""It's not too late,"" I agree, smiling with tears in my eyes. I'm about to make a kind of declaration of love like he did, but his phone interrupts us. He manages to fish it out of his pocket and takes one look at the screen before starting to stand. ""I will be right back and then I'm taking your freezing ass inside,"" he says. I giggle and nod. ""Fine. I'll just enjoy my last few minutes of snow alone."" He walks away and I hear him answer as Dr. Cullen before he's out of earshot. He has an important job — I mean, I would know, after all — but I hope he doesn't have to leave. We're supposed to have the rest of my short life together, and I'm quite looking forward to it. While he's gone, I play with the fallen snow around me. I manage to build a little, very awkward looking snowman. He's just three snowballs without a face or arms, but he's mine. I decide his name is Mr. Snow Face. My very last snowman, no matter how pitiful, deserves a name, after all. I still can't get over how beautiful the Cullens' property is, and the sparkling snow just completes the perfect Christmas scene. Edward fulfilled my last wish and then some. In fact, he made it better than I ever could have imagined and I'll never be able to thank him enough. He made a dying girl's wish come true, so he deserves like, sainthood or something. I'm not entirely sure how that works, but I'm going to write a letter to someone. He's an amazing and special man, and one of the best I've ever known. Cancer fucking sucks, but at least I've gotten to know him because of it. I've gotten to fall in love. ""Bella,"" Edward says, sitting back down beside me. I didn't hear him at all — too immersed in my own thoughts — and I'm surprised to see the look on his face. He looks . . . shocked. ""What's wrong?"" I ask. His lips slowly curl into a smile and I'm confused. ""I asked a radiologist friend of mine to look at your scans from this morning. I didn't expect him to get back to me tonight, but that was him."" ""And?"" I can't be hopeful, but his smile makes me want to be. ""It's working. Your tumors . . . they've shrunk."" ""That's impossible, Edward,"" I sigh. ""He's wrong because that's . . . it's not possible. The cancer has spread too much."" He's grinning and I want him to stop. ""You're far from remission, but it's completely possible for the treatment to work. It has, Bella! This is the most progress we've seen in months! Look at me."" He cups my face in his gloved hands, forcing our eyes to meet. ""You could beat this."" I'm speechless. His words are echoing in my head and I'm trying wrap my mind around them. Nothing's worked. Every treatment has literally done nothing to help me, but this last ditch effort one has? I don't know how to believe it. I've resigned myself to believing I'm going to die. I've accepted it and given up, but now I might live longer? ""How much time do I have?"" I ask. He chuckles softly. ""No more talk of time. If this treatment continues to work — and I think it might — you could beat it all together. This is the break we've been waiting for — the one I've been telling you could happen."" I stare into his pretty green eyes as it hits me. ""I might not die!"" I scream. He's laughing harder now and nodding fervently. ""Yes! Bella, this is incredible."" ""Holy shit! Edward, I can't . . . I don't know what to say or think or do. How is this possible? What do we do now?"" ""We continue the treatment,"" he says. ""We'll have to find you a new oncologist, but for tonight, we just celebrate. You and me, Bella. We're going to beat this. I love you so much."" This time it's my lips against his. I didn't even realize I had the strength to attack his face, but apparently I do. I've slipped him tongue, even. My emotions are everywhere, but my focus is him. He's saved my life. ""I love you, too,"" I say. ""I'm sorry that your short commitment to me has now been extended."" He smirks and pecks my lips softly. ""Sweet girl, I'll gladly spend forever with you.

Sweets smiles at the older version of Moondoggie and slips her arm in the crook of his, ""That's all right it's a special occasion."" ""Yes, yes it is,"" Carlisle smiles down at the sweet miracle that brought their son back to them. Sweets smiles back at her Moondoggie as he wraps his arm around his mom's shoulders, who in turn pats his cheek. The large foyer echoes the glad sounds of people excitedly catching up while coats are discarded. Once in the spacious living room, Moondoggie begins to look around expectantly. ""Where's Alice?"" he asks as he looks towards the staircase. Esme speaks up first. ""She doesn't live here,"" Esme begins. ""Come on let's all sit and get comfortable,"" Carlisle says as he ushers them to the grouping of winged back chairs and love seats. Once seated with Sweets, Moondoggie looks to his mom to continue. ""She was married five years ago. They met at a mixer on campus. Jasper was a TA at the time. It was a beautiful wedding,"" she says as she sweeps her hand toward a wall of frames. ""Now he's a professor at the University of Chicago and she has an upscale, couture clothing shop called Charming Things ."" Her face lights up as she adds, ""They have a precious little two-year-old angel named Maddie."" She finishes with a sweep at another set of pictures on the piano. ""Wow, so much has changed. I've missed so much,"" he says with grief. ""But you're back now, that's the main thing,"" Carlisle smiles sadly at his son. ""Are you going to stay for a bit?"" Esme asks carefully. Moondoggie glances at his Sweets, ""I …I don't know what our plans are, but we're here for today. Will she … they be coming by today?"" he asks keeping his gaze on Sweets who sits stiffly next to him. ""They have Christmas with Maddie in the morning and come over for an early dinner around three. Would you like a drink? I have some hors d'oeuvres to set out,"" Esme adds brightly. ""Water would be nice, Esme, thank you. Is there a bathroom I could use to freshen up?"" Sweets asks as she stands. ""Of course, dear, in the hall off the foyer,"" Esme says as she swishes toward the kitchen. ""I'll be right back, Edward,"" Sweets says patting his shoulder. Carlisle watches his son who has his eyes glued to Sweets' retreating form. ""Son?"" ""Something's not right, Pops,"" Moondoggie says shakily. ""Then go after her and make it right,"" he smiles knowingly. She's the one, isn't she?"" Moondoggie smiles shyly back, ""yeah, yeah she is."" ""Then go get her."" Carlisle urges. ~o0o~ H e doesn't turn when he hears the door open or when he feels her nearing him and the nativity in the foyer. ""It's a nice nativity, she comments, ""so realistic."" ""Not since the bike ride,"" he says looking straight ahead. ""What?"" she stills at his tone. ""Youhaven't called me by name since you got off my bike. Why now, Sweets?"" he asks stiffly. ""I … I don't know,"" she whispers dropping her eyes. ""Not good enough, Sweets … Why?"" he growls out. ""You have your family now, you'll be okay. I … I'm glad you'll be okay now,"" she smiles up at him as a tear rolls down her cheek. He doesn't look at her. He doesn't move but to run his finger over the baby in the manger. He picks it up and slips it into his pocket. ""Edward!"" ""No, Sweets,"" he growls as he spins her around and pins her to the archway leading to the dining room. ""Who am I to you?"" He wants to shake her. He watches her eyes for the truth. ""You're my Moondoggie."" She sobs out. He relaxes his hold on her and pulls her into him. And you're my Sweets"" he rests his forehead on hers, running his hand down her hair. ""I'm going to have to call you by your name sometimes,"" She says softly. ""I know, but that's not who I am to you. I want … I need to be your Moondoggie. I want to be your man. You're the answer to my great ' Why ' Sweets. You're why I get up in the morning, why I smile through the day, why I see a future. You are my future. You're it for me, Sweets. You're everything, and I love you,"" he breathes out as he places the baby Jesus in her hand, encasinghers in his own. ""Moondoggie,"" she whispers, ""you've become my home, my family. I love you so much it hurts to think of a moment without you."" ""Then stay with me, Sweets. Tell me you'll stay with me,"" he closes his eyes and shakes her softly. "" Mooooondoggie, "" she waits. When he looks at her, her eyes are glancing up. ""Moondoggie, look … mistletoe "" He looks up. ""Remember, it's all in, Sweets,"" he challenges. ""Yes, please,"" she sighs, wrapping her arms around his neck. He growls as he pulls her flush against him . He tugs at her hair, gently tilting her head back. Cupping her face with his hand, he gazes heatedly into her eyes seeing the love and longing he's been waiting for. ""I love you, Sweets,"" he breathes out as his lips cover hers. He wraps her tighter, pulling her closer as her mouth opens for him. He groans as his tongue slides along hers. Tasting, Feeling, Claiming. Her whimper almost makes his knees buckle.

My mother dozed in the armchair near the tree, Magda played with her new doll in front of the fire, and Bella snuggled into my chest. I thought everything was damn near perfect. For the first time in a long time I was completely content, utterly happy. The only thing that broke the feeling were the sounds coming from the little girl at my feet. Magda was sniffling. ""What's wrong, baby?"" Bella asked, pulling the girl from the pile of wrapping paper and cuddling her close. On closer inspection, there were tear tracks down Magda's cheeks and those big brown eyes were watery, her chin tight and her bottom lip trembling. ""I asked Santa for a daddy,"" Magda hiccuped, ""but he didn't bring one."" ""You have a daddy, baby,"" Bella mumbled dejectedly. ""But he never comes home."" Magda's big eyes were getting bigger and wetter by the moment and I knew I had about four and half seconds to act before this perfect morning dissolved into a puddle of tears, from both mother and child. I pushed off the couch and picked Magda up right out of Bella's lap, walking with her to the windows. It had stopped snowing, but a hand to the glass to wipe away the fog showed us both a frosted winter wonderland. Magda curled her arms around my neck and I held her tight, trying to figure out what to say to her. ""You know... I was really lonely when I met you and your mom,"" I admitted, not exactly sure why I was saying this to a five-year-old. Something about Magda made me want to be honest. Something about the morning I'd just spent, the way that I'd spent it, made me feel nostalgic for something I didn't even know I was missing. The solid weight of this little girl never failed to amaze me and I adjusted her in front of me so that we were face to face. Magda sniffled and put her head down on my shoulder, wrapping her arms around my neck so tightly it was nearly uncomfortable. ""I think my mom was lonely too,"" she whispered. ""Will you come back home with us?"" ""I'm trying to figure that out, kiddo."" "" You could be my dad,"" she said, sounding surprised by her own revelation. I tried not to react, but I couldn't help it. Bella's intake of breath behind us had me fidgeting, my heart suddenly pumping overtime, and the room way too hot. My shoulders stiffened and my neck turned red. ""Maybe, kid,"" I choked. ""Maybe… How about you go get your boots and your jacket and we go outside for a little while? We can play in the snow."" ""Yeah!"" Magda squealed, easily distracted, and hopped out of my arms, running off to find her snow gear. I stared out the window, Magda's words echoing through my big empty brain. A sneak peek preview of what that kind of life could look like played out on the glass before me in two second snippets, fragile as a castle made of sand. The busy mornings and the lazy afternoons. The quiet, peaceful evenings. The kid, her hand holding and those sticky kisses. The girl, her killer smile, those legs, waiting for me in bed. Finally falling asleep with someone special, instead of alone. The refrigerator full, instead of only mustard and beer, and covered in crayon drawings. My house full of noise, instead of lonely and silent. A hand on my shoulder nearly made me flinch, but when I looked down, all I could see was the top of Bella's head resting against my arm. She wrapped her arms around my waist and I returned the gesture, tugging her in close, struggling to swallow the lump in my throat. ""I bet you'd be the best,"" Bella sighed, her voice soft and sure. ""The best what?"" I asked, my own voice wobbling with uncertainty . ""Dad."" ""You sound just like your kid, asking me to come home with you."" ""She is mine, after all."" Bella hugged me closer, chuckling under her breath. ""Thought you weren't that kind of girl? What made you change your mind?"" ""You."" She looked up at me, those pretty eyes wide and her mouth in a smile. I covered her cheek with my hand, holding her still to kiss her, just about ready to accept or agree or sign on for whatever it was she was offering me, when we were interrupted. ""I'm ready!"" Magda announced, tugging at my sleeve, dressed for an arctic expedition save for the jacket she couldn't zip by herself. Bella disentangled from my arms and dropped to her knees, zipping her daughter up tight. ""Are you excited?"" Bella asked. ""I used to play in the snow all the time when I was your age."" She adjusted Magda's hat and helped her slide into her gloves. ""How do you play in snow?"" Magda asked, glancing warily out the windows. ""Won't I get wet?"" ""Maybe a little, but Edward will show you what to do."" Bella looked up at me with a serious ""mom"" face on. ""No snowballs,"" she warned me. ""Fine, fine,"" I laughed. ""We're gonna build a snowman."" ""You can't build a man out of snow ."" Magda crumpled her nose in confusion, shaking her head at me, and I laughed out loud, taking her hand as we stepped out the door. ""Sweetie, if you can build a castle out of sand, we can build a man out of snow."" The End Hosts Note: Please leave the author some love by submitting a review.

424,4,13,4-Mistletoe-Contest-13.txt,twilight,MistletoeContest,"ourselves, I had taken a photo of our plates and sent it to Renee while Edward sent one to his mother Esme. We hadn't had any responses so guessed that we were still getting the cold shoulder. We would worry about that later as now it was time for all the presents! XXX I went to our Christmas tree to meet Edward, where he said he would be after getting a drink but found the tree all alone. I called out his name in case he was still in the kitchen but got no response, the rest of the presents were still under the tree so he hadn't run off with them but I noticed that they had all been moved back towards the back of the tree. At the front was a little card, I knelt down to get a better look and it said 'meet me at the mistletoe' I was beyond confused. I looked around the room to see if Edward had suddenly come in to say he had been messing around with me but only found a blanket had been laid out on the floor next to the fire. I decided to humor the card and head outside to the mistletoe and see if that would enlighten me. I wrapped my cardigan wrapped around me as I opened the front door and went round to the side where the kissing stuff was growing. I froze on the spot as I saw Edward kneeling on one knee underneath the mistletoe with an open box in his hand. He had also created a path of red rose petals leading up to him. He looked up at me through his lashes and his uncertainty tugged at my heart. I overcame my shock and forced myself to take a step forward towards him, once I'd taken the first step the rest came easily and before I realised what was happening he had my left hand in his. ""Isabella Swan, I love you. I have loved you from the second I laid eyes on you. I fell in love with you all over again when I got to know the beautiful person you are inside as well as out. I want to be your forever; I can't live in this world without you. Will you please marry me?"" I had to blink back tears as they threatened to fall down my cheeks and turn me into a blubbering mess. I nodded. ""I would love to marry you, a life without you, isn't a life"" He placed the ring on my finger; I hadn't paid any attention to it until then. It was a platinum back with small diamonds leading to a slightly raised center diamond. It was elegant and not over the top...it was perfect. The tears began to fall as he stood up and hugged me tight, then lifted me in his arms and carried me inside our cottage. He laid me down on the blankets that were on the floor next to the fire and kissed me gently. ""I'm going to show you just how much I love you."" He kissed my forehead then my eyes and slowly traced my whole face with soft kisses. Kissing my neck, his hands slowly undid my cardigan and he lifted me slightly to get it and my t-shirt off, I reached for his top and pulled that over his head. He worshiped my naked body, softly kissing and kneading my breasts and kissing every inch of my stomach and arms. As he reached my belly button I lifted my hips so he could slide my jeans and panties off, which he did before stepping out of his own clothing. Kneeling in front of me, my legs were thoroughly kissed and massaged as well as my feet; he took his time with each one making me feel loved and cherished. I loved every second but was about to combust if I didn't get any kind of friction or release soon. He parted my knees gently and placed himself between my legs, biting my inner thighs as he got closer to where I wanted him. His tongue found my wet slit and licked its way up and down, only gently touching my bundle of nerves. My wet folds were parted and held in place as his tongue finally worked its magic, twirling around my clit before licking my whole pussy, sending shivers up my spine. A magical finger found its way inside as he began massaging my inner walls before a second finger joined it, the tongue continued licking and sucking my juices. It was slow and sensual and I was going to lose it big time, I felt my muscles clamp around Edwards fingers as I came hard and shuddered from the after effects. Edward licked his fingers clean and smiled. ""You are definitely my favorite flavour, Bella beats chocolate every time."" I pulled him to me and kissed him hard until he slowed the pace, my arms locked around his neck as he pushed his way into my waiting body. He moved slowly, an inch at a time, I tried to push him inside quicker with my feet which were pushing down on his back but he wouldn't budge. He slowly filled me completely and stopped for a second once he had, I felt whole having him inside me and then he started moving, making sure I felt every little bit of it. He kissed every part of my body that he could reach as he moved in me slowly building me up again. I moved my hips in rhythm with his, our bodies sliding against each other as we moved in sync until we both came together. XXX Hosts Note: Please leave the author some love by submitting a review.

425,4,12,4-Mistletoe-Contest-12.txt,twilight,MistletoeContest,"bra before he lifted his eyes to mine, seeking permission. I nodded as he pulled the cup down and moved his lips over my nipple. Oh God, the feeling was incredible and I couldn't help but moan as he parted his lips and I felt his hot breath fanning over my skin. He kissed his way over to my other breast and kissed over it as he slipped his hands behind me and unhooked my bra pulling it from my body. He moved his hands to cup my breasts as he sucked my nipple into to mouth, flicking it as I moaned and arched into him. He kissed back up to my lips and I could feel his growing erection against my stomach. He pulled away quickly; and I felt the loss of his lips, and I groaned, fearing that he was going to stop us again. ""Edward,"" I said as he looked down into my eyes. ""Baby, do you think you'd be more comfortable upstairs?"" he asked as he took a breath. ""Please,"" I murmured with hooded eyes. I wanted to feel and see more of him. He stood up and then lifted me up into his arms and carried me towards the stairs. I kissed my way up his neck to his ear and I nipped at it gently. He growled lowly in his chest as he continued up the stairs at a quicker pace. He practically kicked his door open as he walked into the room and laid me on the bed and then he pulled off his shirt and laid down over me again as he crushed his lips to mine. My hands went to his chest as I ran my fingertips over his nipples and down over his stomach. I could feel his muscles constricting as my fingers moved over them. My hands went to the button of his pants and I fumbled with it. Once I had it unbuttoned, I slipped my hand inside and in a moment of utter boldness, I ran my fingers over his erection, and I heard him groan loudly in my mouth. I loved that I could get him to make a sound like that. ""Bella,"" he murmured as he thrust into my hand. ""If you keep that up, I'll be coming in no time."" I removed my hand quickly and placed it on his back as he kissed me deeply. I moved my hand up and down his back and I could feel the warmth of his skin beneath my touch. He ran his fingertips over my nipple, plucking at it before he lowered his head and started kissing down my chest to my breast as he sucked my nipple between his lips again. His slowly sucked at it and I couldn't help but moan loudly, every nerve ending was set on fire and I didn't know what would quench this fire, except maybe more of him. Our kisses turned more heated as our bodies moved together, both of us seeking the friction we needed. ""Edward,"" I whispered as I arched up into him. ""What is it, baby?"" he asked as he kissed along my neck. ""I ...I want more."" He got up quickly, took off the rest of his clothes and then sat on the edge of the bed, looking down at me. It looked like he was seeking permission. I nodded up at him, and he moved his hands to my pants and slid them down my legs. I felt a bit self-conscious as his eyes traveled up my body before he moved his over mine. ""You're so beautiful, Baby,"" he murmured as he crushed his lips to mine and kissed me deeply. I moved my hands up his back to his shoulders and then back down again as our hands explored each other. He nudged my legs apart as he settled between them and our tongues tangled together. I felt him so close to where I wanted him. I pulled my lips from his and looked deep into his eyes; I saw a look of love there that I've never seen from anyone before and I wanted to keep that look there forever. I slid my hand down his chest to his rigid cock and wrapped my hand around him as I guided him inside me. We both moaned as he filled me, and I moved my hands back to his shoulders as he pulled back and then pushed back into me. Our movements were slow and gentle as we looked into each other's eyes, our breath mingling together as we moaned. We both knew this wasn't just sex, it was the beginning of something beautiful. After reaching our release, we were laying in each other's arms as he sat up and looked at me. ""Bella... I ... we ... shit, I forgot to use a condom,"" he said his voice full of regret. ""Shh... baby, it's fine. I'm covered. I'm safe too, I haven't been with anyone in a long time,"" I said softly as I looked into his green eyes. ""Me either, and I'm safe, also."" He settled back into my arms as we laid there just thinking about how perfect it was. I wanted so much to say that I loved him, but the words wouldn't come, I knew he knew it just by the way he was looking at me. Sometimes our actions speak louder than our words. I lay in his arms feeling content and happy for the first time in ages. I realized then, that sometimes life takes you places you had no idea you should go. And a little push from a meddling friend and a small sprig of mistletoe can lead you there, too. Hosts Note: Please leave the author some love by submitting a review.

426,4,20,4-Mistletoe-Contest-20.txt,twilight,MistletoeContest,"Happy Anniversary, love. Marrying you was the best thing I've ever done, and I would do it again and again. Spending the evening with our families made me realize how lucky we are to have them. Your parents treat me like their own and our parents get along … thank god. My Christmas wish is that you are safe, wherever you are. The only thing better than that is to wish you were safe and home … maybe next year. I love you. Your Bella Turning off the light, I lie down on my pillow. The tears flow; I can't help it. I miss him and worry about him. In a little less than a year he will be out of the Army, with the knowledge and education it would have taken him four years to complete in college. We can see the light at the end of the tunnel, but right here, right now … it hurts. I doze, my sleep fitful and filled with Edward. I hover in that zone between sleep and awake. Sometime past midnight I must have fallen into a deeper sleep because I'm startled awake by the doorbell. I groggily turn on the bedside lamp, grabbing a blanket and wrapping it around my shoulders as I amble to the door. There is another ring of the doorbell and a knock before I get to it. I look out the peephole, or at least I try to, but it's a bit too high for me. ""Who is it?"" I use my deepest, strongest voice. I don't hear anything from the other side. Standing on my tiptoes to try the peep hole once again, I see the top of a military hat. It makes my heart stop. ""Who is it?"" I ask again, my voice cracking with tension. ""It's me, Bella. Open the door."" Before his sentence is finished I've got the door open and launch myself into his arms. I wrap my arms and legs around him, the blanket forgotten on the door step. I don't feel the cold night air, I don't feel anything but him, my Edward. ""You're here!"" I repeat over and over again. Hugging him tightly, I pepper any part of him I can with kisses. He holds me just as tightly, his face buried in my hair. ""I love you, baby."" ""I love you, so much."" ""Let's go inside,"" he whispers into my ear, moving us inside just inside the house. He moves to set me down, and reluctantly I unwrap my legs and put my weight on the floor. He grabs his bag, and I grab the blanket. Once the door is closed and locked I'm on him again, but this time instead of feeling relief that he is here and safe, I am motivated by passion, by want. When he presses me into the door I feel his want for me, hard and long against me. ""Bedroom. Now."" He makes quick work of removing my pajamas. Laying bare in front of him, his eyes devour me. I also take time to appreciate how he looks in his fatigues. His smirk tells me he knows what I'm doing. I've always loved him in his uniform. ""You can take it off now,"" I command, and he does. Skin on skin, nothing between us—no continents, no army, no clothing, just us. We kiss, touch, whisper lovingly to each other. When he finally enters me it's like I can fully breathe again, like my strength is renewed. He takes control, giving me what I need, giving himself to me. Words are not needed, our bodies speaking their own language. We lie sated, our breath calming, our bodies still touching, entwined. ""How are you here?"" ""I knew I had a leave coming, but things were so up in the air I didn't want to get your hopes up. I was determined to get here one way or another. I just wasn't sure if it would be in time for Christmas."" He sighs. ""I missed our anniversary. Happy anniversary, Bella."" ""Happy anniversary, Edward,"" I say, giving him a kiss on those lips I missed so much. ""But as far as I'm concerned it's still our anniversary."" I roll on top of him. ""Best. Gift. Ever."" I punctuate each word with kisses. And that leads to round two. My man has some stamina. Round three happens when we wake up in the morning, and round four in the shower. We barely leave the house by ten a.m., but I know our families will forgive me when they see why I'm late. I watch him drive, his strong arms gripping the steering wheel, his command of the car. ""God, I really hate to share you,"" I say with a groan. ""I know. I feel the same way, but you've got me for two weeks,"" he says, glancing over and giving me his signature smile. ""How's that honey-do list?"" ""There's only one thing on the list."" ""Really?"" ""Yep."" ""Are you going to tell me what it is?"" he coaxes. ""Well, you've been working on it already."" ""I have?"" I nod. ""Four times."" ""Four times?"" he questions. ""Oh! Four times! Really?"" ""Yep. I went off birth control just like we talked about. If I get pregnant now you'll be out by the time he or she is born. If it doesn't happen now, then we get to keep trying."" ""I like trying."" He smiles. The moment everyone sees Edward walk in the door, the house erupts in excitement. Watching Edward with his family and mine, back home where he should be, is the best present I could ever receive. And once again Edward gives me a memorable Christmas. Our special day. Our Christmas Love Story. Hosts Note: Please leave the author some love by submitting a review.

427,4,14,4-Mistletoe-Contest-14.txt,twilight,MistletoeContest,"been a good girl this year; Santa must have brought it for me."" I reach out and let one finger travel along the cup of her bra, right below her breast, loving the way her skin pebbles and her breathing hitches at my touch. ""Merry Christmas, Edward,"" she whispers, her eyes shining with love. I brush my lips to hers and then bury my face in her neck, kissing and tasting her all over. I move lower to her collarbone, tracing my tongue all over her chest. ""Merry Christmas, Bella. I love you."" She giggles when I trace my fingers lower, tickling her ribs on the way. Even though we've only been together a year, I decided to make the '12 days, 12 gifts' thing a tradition. I laughed when she told me that last year, she initially thought I'd gotten her underwear as the last gift. It turned out to be the red dress she wore on Christmas Day. Naturally, sexy lingerie was one of her 12 gifts this year. It's the first time I've bought her underwear, so I wasn't sure what her reaction would be. I'm guessing she doesn't mind, though. ""Can I unwrap you now, Bella?"" I ask, my fingers moving lower, toying with the lace of her sexy red boy shorts, letting my finger dip below the fabric. ""Yes..."" she breathes, her eyes closing. ""I wasn't sure what you'd think of this... It's a first for us,"" I say as I lean back and pull the underwear down her legs, tossing them across the bed. I make quick work of my pajama pants and settle back down between her legs. ""You know I love everything you give me,"" she whispers. ""You're too hard on yourself."" ""I'll be too hard on you,"" I say, bucking my hips, loving the way our bodies mold together. Her fingers dig into my ass as she pulls me closer, and I slide a hand between her and the mattress, fumbling with the clasp of her bra. With all the barriers removed, she reaches down and lines me up, and I can't help but moan as I sink inside. My eyes roll back into my head as she threads her fingers into the hair at the back of my neck, tugging in the most delightful way, and pulls me closer, as if she can't get close enough. I kiss her as I push all the way in before pulling back slowly. She growls as I tease her a little, rubbing the head of my cock around her clit, watching her tremble. She both loves and hates it when I tease her like this, and I see her grit her teeth in frustration as she reaches down again. ""Edward…"" My name falls from her lips in a quiet gasp as I thrust quickly. She moans and clenches around me, and then arches her back to meet my thrusts. My gaze takes in the beauty below me. Not for the first time, I wonder how I got so lucky. Her pleas and cries spur me on to fuck her harder before I pull out and roll onto my back, maneuvering her on top of me. She gasps in surprise but recovers quickly, her eyes glistening with lust. ""Yes..."" I gasp, watching as she rolls her hips, finding her rhythm, grinding and circling as she locks eyes with me. Every time just gets better, and I fight to keep my eyes on her so I can just watch. Shadows dance over her curves, and I follow them with my hands. I touch her everywhere I can, playing with her nipples and digging my thumb into her hips. Soon, her movements become frenzied, and I can feel my own orgasm approach. I trail my thumb between us, encouraging her toward the edge first. ""Come on, baby,"" I grind out, knowing I won't last much longer. I sit up a little and pull her closer, hitting even deeper and sinking my teeth into the soft flesh of her shoulder as she shudders and clenches around me. I follow seconds after, and we ride it out together, our hips slowing, hands clinging to each other, and her lips on mine. I collapse back on the bed, bringing her with me. We're all sweaty skin and heaving breaths, euphoric as we come down. We lie for a while, peaceful and content in each other's arms before she rolls off me and heads to the bathroom to clean up. I get up off the bed, pulling my sleep pants back on. I make a quick trip to the sock drawer where her next present has been hiding for six months now. I knew pretty early in our relationship that Bella was it for me. I mean, I knew before we got together, but being with her only confirms what I already hoped. Getting to know all of her, the highs and lows, all her little quirks and habits, good and bad; falling in love with her has been the easiest thing in the world, and I only fall deeper every day. After all the grand gestures and gifts over the last 12 days, I want this to be the one that surprises her the most. I thought of a million different crazy romantic ways to propose to Bella, but Christmas morning in our pajamas on our first anniversary seems perfect to me, and I don't think she'll be expecting it. The bathroom door opens, and she steps out dressed in her robe, pulling her hair into a bun on top of her head. She's in her own little bubble, humming a Christmas tune as she makes her way to the closet. I clear my throat, and when she turns, I'm down one knee in the middle of our bedroom. ""Marry me, Bella?"" xXx Thank you for reading – we hope you enjoyed our story! Hope everyone has a great festive period with friends and family! Karen & Meg xox"
428,4,1,4-Mistletoe-Contest-1.txt,twilight,MistletoeContest,"relaxed on the bench despite the cold surface under their butts. They enjoyed just sitting next to each other and watch people, sipping from their cups. ""So, up for another round?"" Edward asked as they had finished their hot chocolate and threw their cups in the trash next to them. It was already starting to get dark, which made the Christmas lights and glow-in-the-dark ornaments light up and cast a fairytale-like glow between the stands and stalls. Bella looked sideways at Edward and couldn't believe how good her day has turned out. Her frustration with her friend totally forgotten she wondered secretly if this was her plan all along when she invited Bella a week earlier to go to this fair. ""So you still don't have a tree?"" Edward asked, breaking through her thoughts. ""No, and probably won't for a while, not while Vlad and Zafrina are still alive at least. Zafrina would climb up to the top and Vlad would bark and try to catch her. Those two would most likely destroy my tree and everything in it within a day,"" Bella sighed. She loved her pets a lot, but she missed a tree around Christmas. ""I can imagine that. Too bad though. I know how much you like them,"" Edward put an arm around her shoulders and squeezed before letting go again. When they reached another ornament stand, Edward halted and looked at everything. Finally he picked something up and paid for it. They came across a snack stand and both bought a hotdog. It wasn't really in tune with the Christmas feeling but they didn't care, they both wanted one so they got them. While they munched on their snack they strolled between the other gift stalls to look for suitable presents for Edward's family. The shyness between them was completely gone and they were back to their easy friendship. They were discussing the 'idea' of snow: the different kinds of snow, the ability to build snowmen and igloos, the beauty of unstirred snow in nature and the funny side of it with snowball fights. A clock on one the stalls showed them it was already an hour later after they had their hot chocolate and they were both satisfied. They weren't thirsty or hungry, they had all the gifts Edward needed and they had sang along with random people who were singing off key with the music that came through the speakers. It was completely dark now, as the night had fully set in now. It was colder now and the snow didn't seem to let up anytime soon so unconsciously Bella and Edward leaned closer towards each other, until at one point Bella was leaning against his side and he had his arm wrapped around her shoulders. ""Hey Bella, I've got something for you,"" Edward whispered softly. They stopped walking and Bella turned to face him. He pulled out something from his pocket and gave it to her. ""I know you can't have a tree, but I wanted you to have this. You can hang it on your wall or something."" Edward sounded unsure the longer he spoke and Bella gazed at his face and then at what was in his outstretched hand. She gasped as she saw the ornament he had earlier. She hesitantly reached for it and held it closer to really see what it was. It was a little cartoonish Rudolph on a red ball. She touched the contours of the ornament in amazement before gazing back at Edward. She suddenly felt shy again too. ""Thank you,"" she whispered. ""Bella, I did some thinking and I just… I think friendship might be a too soft definition for what I feel for you. I like you Bella, a lot, more than a friend…,"" Edward confessed in a shy voice. Bella stood still, trying to comprehend what he was saying. ""I love you, Bella,"" Edward finally spoke with conviction. Before she could answer they heard their names being called. They both looked up and saw Rosalie and Emmett coming towards them. Emmett held up his phone while Rosalie was gesturing wildly towards something. Edward and Bella looked at each other silently asking if the other knew what they meant. Bella felt some annoyance creep back in though. Of all the moments today, Rosalie decided to show up now. Bella was happy that she got to spend all this time alone with Edward and now she wished Rosalie and Emmett would have just forgotten about her. Rosalie was yelling and when she got closer they heard her say: ""Look up, above you."" When Bella and Edward looked up together they saw what Rosalie meant: they were standing under mistletoe. Somehow they must have halted under a string of ribbons and entwined with it was mistletoe. They both laughed as they looked back at each other. Bella felt a fluttering in her stomach at what this meant. She felt a bit unsure though. Sure she had dreamed and fantasized about kissing Edward but now it might actually happen. Her thoughts were cut off as she felt his gloved hands on her cheeks and his lips on her. The world seemed to explode as a feeling of immense happiness spread inside of her, warming her whole body. She wasn't cold anymore as Edward pressed his lips softly but determinately against her. She responded in kind. For a while every noise except the music disappeared, the snow hitting their face didn't bother her, the sound of cheering and clapping was lost to her. When they pulled back, they stared at each other for a moment. ""Merry Christmas, Edward. I love you too,"" Bella spoke first. Edward hugged her and whispered 'Merry Christmas' in her ear.

429,4,25,4-Mistletoe-Contest-25.txt,twilight,MistletoeContest,"delivering is for him … my idea. He doesn't know it yet, but I got some help from our little friends down at the shop. Jessica and Kris live near the shop now and they promised to call me the moment Edward is back so I could get ready. So here I am waiting for my husband to come home from work. Jessica called me ten minutes ago to let me know that Edward was back and they were unloading the sleigh and checking everything over. My friends will 'find' one last present in the sack... Edward will have forgotten to give a gift to a child, but the address on it is his own. I told you this will be a Christmas he won't forget. ""Bella!"" Ah, he is here. ""Yes, Edward."" ""What is this?"" He held a present in his hand. ""Well open it. It has your name on it after all…"" I said, unable to hide the smile on my face. ""But..."" ""Open it, Edward."" He opened the wrapper and looked at it. ""What is it?"" he asked me holding a picture in his hand with a look of confusion on his face. ""That, Edward; are your children..."" I told him. ""What do you mean my children?"" Edward is looking at the ultrasound picture, not seeing a thing on it. ""We are going to be mommy and daddy of two babies, Edward. I'm pregnant."" ""You are having a baby? I'm going to be a daddy?"" ""No, not a baby… two babies, and yes, you are going to be a daddy."" ""When?"" ""I am now ten weeks pregnant so at the end of July we will have two bundles of joy in our arms."" He picked me up and kissed me deeply, ""Thank you, baby, I love you."" ""I love you too and Merry Christmas, Santa."" I said just as the clock announced the new day – Christmas day. How it is possible, we'll never know, but the twins managed to be born on different days. Jane was born on July the 24th and Jacob was born on July the 25th exactly seven minutes apart and seven months after I told Edward I was pregnant. So our twins aren't twins on paper, but it does give each of them their own day to celebrate. Five months later we celebrated their first Christmas. Edward had arranged for the biggest tree he could fit into our house. Nothing is too extreme for his kids. I shake my head at the memories. The presents, well what can I say… being the kids of Santa Claus himself could be a bit too much. They loved it then, and still do to this day . When they turned ten years old we told them our secret, it was the sleigh that convinced them. It always will be the key in making people believe. This year will be different though. Edward is now 70 years old, and the reindeer have just informed us that Jacob Jr. will be the next Santa. Yes, we knew it will be hard for Jacob to find out he will not become Santa, but the reindeer's decision was out of our hands. Jacob Jr. is now 26 years old and we know he found his truelove and kissed her. That´s what sets the things in motion. That first kiss locked the seal, no way back from it. The invite to come with his lady tonight to his grandparents has already been sent. It felt strange knowing this will be our last year here as Santa and Mrs. Claus. Next year we will live near the shop helping with the presents and everything. Just to be sure I've put up mistletoe above the door… to collect another kiss and see magic happen—Christmas magic. Jacob Jr. and his lady arrived just a little after nine, and yes I got to see them kiss. She's a shy sweet girl, her name is Renesmee. She's named after her grandmothers Renee and Esme. I love her name and her completely. After some hot cocoa we start our story, the one that will change all of our lives. And yes, Edward is ready for it, ready to let go of his suit. Yes, he will miss it, but we will have a Christmas at home for the first time in our married life together. Just before dawn Edward got his phone call and the next thing I know, I have a fresh cup of hot cocoa with Renesmee. I'm calming her down telling her it will all be just fine, just like Jessica did with me all those years ago. On December 24th Edward tells me he has a surprise for me. This last year as Santa Claus he is allowed to take me with him, for the first and only time. When he brings back the sleigh we will take residence in our new home, leaving behind our life as we know it. Jacob Jr. and Renesmee will be living on the farm taking care of the reindeer that I love so much. The reindeer are the reason I've lived my life like a fairytale. I found my love in their stable, learned about Santa Claus secrets on the grounds they live on. I married my Santa Claus there, saw my children grow up in the farm house, and now our grandchild will take over the reins. We still don't know the secret behind the reindeer. They are the biggest secret of all... nobody will ever find out how it works, that's the number one rule. Merry Christmas to all, and if you happen to see Santa tonight, tell him how proud we are of him and that we love him. Hosts Note: Please leave the author some love by submitting a review.

""Yes,"" Ellie replied proudly. ""These are my girls."" Esme pulled me into a hug and motioned to Alice. ""Come here, darling."" We were all hugging, and it felt like this was the way it should have always been. ""I'm going to marry that girl, Dad,"" Edward said to his father as they stood by the tree. I was hugging and snooping at the same time. ""I'm pretty sure I can convince Bella to walk down the aisle after graduation. I've loved her since before I even left for Australia, but was too afraid to say anything. I'm not going to be that way anymore."" ""Umm . . . Okay?"" Carlisle looked confused. Poor guy. I didn't blame him for feeling that way. I was a bit confused myself. My life was changing so quickly that I couldn't keep up. Emmett patted Carlisle on the back. ""Isn't it fucking grand, Carl? The family is just getting bigger."" ""Carl?"" Carlisle asked with a grimace. He turned to his brother. ""What did you start with this Carl business?"" Al started laughing uncontrollably. ""Is that Mama's holiday chili? Can I take a taste?"" Esme asked, sniffing the air. She grabbed Alice's and my hands. ""We need a taste test, girls!"" This was going to be the best Christmas I ever had and a start to many more. XXXXXX It was quiet now. The clock had struck midnight, and it was now Christmas. There was a light snow hitting the ground as my fingers touched the glass of the window of my new room at Ellie's. The glass was cool as my fingertips drew snowflakes on the glass. My fingers played with the garnet necklace Edward had placed around my neck after dinner. Sometimes, you need to just accept the gift without complaint. I adored it. ""Whatcha thinking about?"" Edward asked as he wrapped his arms around my waist. ""The future, I guess."" I kept looking at the snow as he rubbed the skin at the waistband of my pajama pants. They had penguins wearing Santa hats, so they weren't the sexist things in the world. ""And?"" A kiss to my neck. ""It seems brighter,"" I admitted. ""Did you read some of my stories?"" I had given him my stories. They were the best parts of me that encompassed the best and worst parts of my past. His hands moved under my tank top. He rubbed my breasts slowly. Teased my nipples with gentle squeezes. ""My girl is so talented. God, I love your words. Can my dad pass them on to his editor friend? Waylon will give you a job in a minute."" ""Will he now?"" I turned and wrapped my arms around his waist. My hands traveled down into his boxers. I clutched his ass under the skiing reindeer. We both had a love of cheesy Christmas novelty clothing. ""Thank you and your dad for doing that for me."" His lips tasted like candy canes. We had been moving to this point for the last few days. Kissing and touching becoming more intense at every encounter. This was everything; Edward was everything. It was time. ""Edward, I love you,"" I told him. I hope he already knew. He pulled me tight against his bare chest. ""I love you."" Our mouths crashed. My top was pulled off as we went crashing onto the mattress. We rolled around as the rest of our clothes were shed. Every touch made me feel like I was the most amazing person in his world. The kisses he scattered all over every inch of my skin made me tremble with joy. I returned the favor and let myself enjoy the wonderful way he would whimper at the way my tongue would glide over the contours of his body. His fingers glided into me as I raked my fingers down his back. Edward's fingers twisted in my hair and he pulled the strands gently. Our tongues twisted, and I was left breathless and so was he. ""Are you sure about this,"" Edward whispered. He stared into my eyes, and I saw my future in them. ""I'm sure about you, and I'm sure about us,"" I reassured him. A giggle escaped. ""God, I sound so cheesy."" He chuckled. ""I'm pretty fond of your cheese, lady. Edward became serious then. He pushed into me so slowly and tentatively. I placed a kiss on his lips. A kiss to signal that this was truly what we both wanted. No words were needed. As we gazed into each other's eyes, we would only break the connection to stop and kiss as our bodies twisted together. Flipping and rolling around the comfy mattress, we would occasionally just smile at the buoyant emotions coursing through us. His thrusts became more forcible, and I felt my body tighten in response. I heard some people say that when feeling such intense passion, it was like seeing stars. For me, it was as if I was one with the whole sky filled with shooting stars. When we came together, we were one with not only each other but also the whole galaxy. This relationship was making me a sappy woman, but it didn't matter. I was enjoying the feeling as I was wrapped in Edward's arms. ""This might be the best Christmas I've ever had,"" Edward said. He rubbed my back slowly, making shapes on my skin. ""The beginning of many,"" I added. He flipped me on my back, and I laughed loudly. Edward nuzzled my nose with his. ""The beginning of forever."" Christmas is the season of miracles, and mine had finally been granted. The End. Hosts Note: Please leave the author some love by submitting a review.

431,4,16,4-Mistletoe-Contest-16.txt,twilight,MistletoeContest,"saw you sitting under the oak tree. The first time was about a week after I moved in. You were sitting on the bench, shouting into your phone. I think your exact words were, 'Don't you Bella me, Mom. I'm a grown woman and I can take care of myself,' or something like that. ""I'm not some creepy stalker. You just sounded like me when I'm left answering to my mother too. Just come over and meet some people who will vouch for me. It'll be fun...I promise, Bella."" It was almost as if he was tasting the way my name played on his lips again before he went on his way, only to stop and shout, ""And bring some cookies. You can school me."" His long legs carried him away before I could even get a retort in. Fucking cookies. ~ooo~ I made the cocky but sexy-as-hell bastard his cookies, but I didn't go all out. Edward—Mistletoe Man—whoever he was, was not going to get my Pepperidge Farm deliciousness. Sure, homemade was best, but who really had the time to make them? I'd put way more effort into my appearance than I ever had before: skinny jeans, a black cowl-neck sweater that hugged my curves, and a sexy pair of heeled boots that I knew better than to try and walk in when the ground was icy. But I'd been having a rare klutz-free day and decided to chance it. I knocked on his door, but I wasn't sure if anyone heard me over the music, so I knocked again, harder. He was still sexy standing in the doorway wearing another pair of holey jeans and another Henley, this time in charcoal gray. ""Hey, Bella. Thanks for coming. I see you brought your cookies."" ""They're Tollhouse."" I shoved the Tupperware container into his hands. He looked clueless about what I meant and it was cute. ""Refrigerated section of the grocery store, yellow tube. Slice and then bake. A step up from the knockoffs you purchased,"" I teased. ""Can't go jumping into the deep end of the cookie pool until you've lost your water wings."" He popped open the container and shoved a whole cookie into his mouth. ""Fuck...these are better than mine,"" he mutter with a still full mouth. ""Come on in, I'll introduce you around."" After he hid the cookies in his kitchen and gave me a beer, I met his friends. They were a wild and rambunctious bunch, but exactly the type of people I wanted to hang out with. I laughed almost to the point of tears, drank a few more beers, and then laughed some more. I exchanged numbers with his sister and sister-in-law and planned to meet them at a bar for New Year's Eve. I finally felt like this move was headed in the right direction and it was all because of the Mistletoe Man. I continued to watch him as he circled around the groups that had gathered together inside his place. He never let anyone go without a drink and was a very considerate host. Though try as I might, I couldn't keep my eyes off of him all night, even if it was just through my peripheral sight. The hours seemed to float away, and I was feeling no pain by the time I decided to leave. I said my goodbyes, but Edward insisted on walking me to my door. After I unlocked my door, I turned to him and spoke. ""I had a really nice time. Thank you for inviting me."" ""Thank you for coming...and for the cookies."" He seemed to want to say more, but settled on, ""Goodnight, Bella."" ""Goodnight, Edward."" I turned to step into my apartment before I heard the words, ""Fuck it,"" and then found myself spun around and a set of warm lips caressing my own. While I was startled by the abruptness of the kiss, it was very much welcomed. I couldn't have told up from down as our misty breath mixed and created a fogbank around our faces. When we finally parted, and as if he could sense the question on my mind, he pointed up to my doorway. My eyes landed on the parasitic plant that was now hanging up way higher than I could reach without a ladder. ""Dude, did you just mistletoe me?"" Edward's ears turned a bright pink, a wonderful reminder of his blush in the store earlier even though it wasn't as obvious as it had been in there. He was embarrassed that he believed he needed an excuse to kiss me. The sexual tension he provided for Ginny and I was enough, but he didn't need to know that. ""No,"" he lied and tried to pull out of my arms, but I wasn't about to let that happen. I threw my head back and laughed, a lightness that had been missing inside me bursting forth. I was happier than I'd been in what seemed like forever. ""You totally mistletoed me."" ""No, I didn't."" ""Yes, you did."" I pulled his face down to mine, my lips resting on his. ""You hijacked my mistletoe cherry."" I pecked his lips quickly and Edward's arms tightened around me as he finally relaxed and realized I wasn't mad. It wasn't long before he deepened the kiss I had initiated that time. I couldn't breathe. I didn't care. I just never wanted the kiss to end. But it did. Edward gazed into my eyes, the truth ever so visible, but still he confirmed what I already knew. ""Mistletoed."" I nodded. ""Mistletoed indeed."" Who'd have thought a parasite could be the start of such a beautiful relationship? I was definitely a fan of the plant and its history now. ~ooo~ Hosts Note: Please leave the author some love by submitting a review.

432,4,2,4-Mistletoe-Contest-2.txt,twilight,MistletoeContest,"caresses with her lips before opening her mouth and seeking his tongue with her own. Her hands work the knot of his tie and then continue to the buttons of his shirt before pushing it from his shoulders. All the while their tongues tangle and caress. He pulls back to remove his undershirt while her nimble fingers work his belt and zipper. Within seconds he's standing there in only his boxer briefs. Their mouths collide again while her hands roam up and fist his hair, crushing their mouths together. Their passion flares, burning hot and heavy between them. He lifts her and she locks her legs around his waist. Turning, he carries her to the bed, tongues twisting and tangling the whole way. When he reaches his destination, she releases her legs and allows her body to slide against his own, creating the most delicious friction ever. She kisses him once, just a peck, before winking, turning and sliding across the bed. ""I'm ready,"" she pants to him as she slips her panties down her legs. He doesn't waste a second; lowering his boxers, he tosses them aside and crawls up over her, stalking his prey once more. ""Baby, I love you so much,"" he almost growls to her as he attacks her lips. Slowly and passionately they allow the fire to burn, spreading over them until the only way to put it out is sweet release. Edward poises himself over her, taking her in. The beauty of his girl naked before him with only the fire reflecting on her skin is indescribable. He can't remember a time when he didn't love her and can't imagine a time without her. With slow gentle movements he positions his cock at her entrance. He slides along the heat and slickness until he feels he might go mad with the desire to push. She's squirming and waiting for that moment when she'll feel complete with his length inside her, building the flames so high until she explodes. It's always been that way, and this time can only be more, considering the emotions burning through their souls. With one solid push he's inside and both their worlds are set right. Ever so slowly he pulls back and pushes in again, driving her mad with his patience. His movements pick up as their bodies slip and slide together. Hands roam and tongues taste skin. Connected souls and hearts entwine. Limbs tense and release. Breaths pick up speed and moans leave lips. This moment, these feelings, they want to hold forever. Never ending pleasure passing between them. Time stands still for them, lost in passion and fire. They make love until the flames are burning so hot they're afraid to be consumed by them. ""Baby, please … I can't … can't …"" he pants out to her. Her fingers slide south and find that nub that makes her pleasure peak. ""That's it, baby."" He picks up his speed knowing it's time to extinguish the flames that threaten to burn them alive. ""Ed … ward … I …"" Her words turn to moans by the intense spasms taking place throughout her body. He's dogged in his determination to prolong her pleasure as long as possible, driving into her with a maddening pace. Relentless. When she's finally completed her release he lets go. With one final growl, face buried into her neck, he finds his own powerful climax. A few more sloppy thrusts and all is still. Her hand finds its way to his back and caresses him from ass to shoulder and back, giving him time to settle back into reality. Once he can breathe again, he rolls them on their sides, still connected. The kiss he places on her lips is filled with love and reverence. Worshiping her. Amazed that this is his life, and he'll never be without her. ""I love you, Mrs. Cullen,"" he says with a smile so wide his face might split. ""I love you, Mr. Cullen."" They lie there, both lost in their thoughts of what an amazing life they have and how it all began. Under the mistletoe. Edward and Bella, two years later This will be the first year the annual Cullen Christmas party isn't taking place. Everyone in Forks understands even though they'll miss it. The Cullens and Swans have something much more important to do. In Seattle, the family gathers around a tiny bundle swaddled in a Christmas blanket. Holly Noel Cullen was born four days before, disappointing her mother's hopes for a Christmas baby. No one is too upset about her being impatient to come out though. Her grandparents can't get enough of her. Uncle Emmett is completely enthralled. His new wife Angela, after a whirlwind courtship, has her own secret Christmas gift for him, the gift that they'll be parents, too, by next Christmas. And Holly's parents … they're over the moon. The love they feel for this tiny being is almost unreal. Even the love they have for each other, which is already overwhelming and legendary, has grown due to this momentous occasion. Later, after everyone has left, the two parents look down at the angel in her mother's arms and know how blessed they are. ""Bella, thank you so much for her."" She kisses her husband softly and gently runs a fingertip down her daughter's cheek. ""Thank you, Edward, for a lifetime."" That night, as the couple creeps up to the nursery to lay their sweet baby down, they notice something. They look at each other and smile, knowing her grandmothers have been here and brought with them one of the best gifts ever. Because hanging above the beautifully decorated crib, perfectly placed, is their very own sprig of mistletoe. Hosts Note: Please leave the author some love by submitting a review.

433,4,31,4-Mistletoe-Contest-31.txt,twilight,MistletoeContest,"face. ""You did promise me a few dances. I think I'd like to give it a try now."" ""Excuse us,"" Edward said to his parents and led me to the dance floor. I wrapped one hand around the back of his neck while he placed one of his on my hip. His other hand took mine and held it over his heart. We swayed with the rest of the couples to a rendition of ""White Christmas"". ""Did you know this is my favorite Christmas song?"" I asked. ""No, I didn't. Will this be your first white Christmas?"" ""Yes. Christmas in Florida was almost always spent at the beach. Renee loves the water. When we moved to Arizona, we always went some place tropical for the holidays. Phil was thinking of taking a cruise this year before he got sick."" I stopped moving for a moment at the thought of Phil. I had been so caught up in the wonder of Forks, I had forgotten about the man who was my father for over twenty years. I felt Edward's fingertips lift my chin. ""It's okay to grieve for him and still be happy you're here. That's what he wanted, right?"" ""Yes, that's what he said."" ""Come on. Let's grab our coats. I want to show you something."" I nodded and Edward led us off the dance floor to retrieve our coats. ""Where are we going?"" I asked while we were bundling up. ""A surprise."" We ducked into a hallway that led to a back entrance. We walked out into the snow and I couldn't believe what I was seeing. ""I wanted to ask you earlier, but there wasn't enough time."" ""Edward. This is so …"" There weren't words to describe what I felt in that moment. A horse drawn sled covered in white twinkling lights and Emmett at the helm was ready to ride. ""I wanted our first date to be memorable. Would you want to take a ride with me?"" ""Yes!"" I turned and wrapped my arms around his neck. He lifted me up and swung me around in circles. ""Come on, little lady,"" Emmett yelled. ""There's blankets and hot chocolate to keep you warm back there."" Edward helped me up into the sled before stepping in himself. We got the blanket tucked around us before Emmett took off. ""And to think, I was just going to ask you over for dinner."" ""You were?"" Edward slipped his arm around my shoulders and brought me in closer. ""I was going to ask you this morning after the cinnamon rolls, but everything happened and I didn't. Now I'm glad I never had the chance. This is perfect, Edward."" ""I had some help, but this …"" He pulled a sprig of mistletoe from his pocket and held it above his head. ""This was all my idea."" He leaned in and caressed his chilled lips with my own. Within seconds, all thoughts of the cold were gone. It was hard to get a hold of his hair with my thick gloves, but he got the message and kicked the kiss up a notch. I secretly prayed that Emmett would take us to Edward's place. If my entire body felt like it was on fire from just his kiss, I could only imagine the inferno he'd create when his touch landed elsewhere. Something cold and wet fell on my overheated cheek. Edward slowed us down and we pulled back from the kiss to find it was snowing. He smiled and place three soft pecks on my lips. ""Wishes do come true."" ### Three years later Bella I reclined into Edward's arms while we sat on the couch at my dad and Sue's house. We had just finished the one Christmas tradition we'd started when I came back to Forks: family snowball fight. While Sue cooked Christmas breakfast, Dad, Seth, Leah, Edward, and I let the snow fly. It was some kind of miracle that we had a white Christmas three years running. ""You warm enough?"" Edward asked then kissed my neck below my ear. ""I am now."" Kisses from my husband of two years were a sure fire way to heat me up in an instant. ""How about a present before we eat,"" Seth asked. ""I have one I want Dad to open."" I sat up and reached for the small present I had set on the coffee table. I handed it to my dad as Sue sat on the arm of his recliner. ""It's for the whole family, but we wanted Dad to open it."" Suspicious as always, my dad shook the gift next to his ear then felt its weight in his hands. Sometimes the best gifts came in small packages. He tore the paper away and opened the box. Sue gasped the second she saw it. ""I couldn't find the exact snowflake ornament, so I made it to look as close to yours as possible."" He pulled the ornament out of the box and let it dangle from his finger. ""Bella."" He stood and walked to where I sat. I took the hand he offered and he pulled me up into his arms. ""I love you. Thank you for making my wish come true."" Edward came up behind me and put his hand on my back. ""She made all our wishes come true, Chief."" ""That she did."" He moved over to the tree and placed the ornament with the sonogram picture in the center right next to mine. ""I hope you can make some more of these. I'd like to see this tree full of pictures of my grandkids."" ""Sure, Dad."" It might take a while, but between Leah, Seth, and I, I knew dad would get his wish.

434,4,29,4-Mistletoe-Contest-29.txt,twilight,MistletoeContest,"tonight,"" he vowed as he touched my cheek. ""Merry Christmas, Bella."" ""Merry Christmas, Edward,"" I responded with a smile. MP Epilogue: Four years later… I arrived home carrying a small bag in my hands. After my last exam, I went shopping. I bought something special for Edward to celebrate. Our lives have become busy, with him being in his fourth year of medical school, and my final year at U-Dub. The door opened to find that he had gotten home before me. The room was decorated with white lights, that casted a dim glow and all the furniture had been pushed away. Hanging from the ceiling, in the center of the room, was a kissing ball covered in mistletoe. A glittering from it caught my eye. I stepped forward, slowly trying to examine it closer. ""Edward?"" I called out in the quiet room. I got no response, so I stepped right underneath the kissing ball and looked up. There was a ring dangling from the mistletoe, not just a ring, but a diamond one, accented with sapphires, my birthstone. I dropped my bag at my feet, covering my mouth with my hand. The room filled with the song ""It Must Have Been the Mistletoe."" ""Bella?"" Edward appeared at my side. I stopped looking up at the kissing ball, and turned towards him. ""Please, tell me these are happy tears."" He brushed the tears from my cheeks. I nodded as I looked him up and down. The tears slid down more as I noticed what he was wearing. He was wearing his glasses with a bowtie and the Santa's Hat with Mistletoe was on his head, looking like the adorkable boy that I fell in love with. Only his hat didn't read 'kiss me'; it read 'Marry me?' ""Isabella Marie Swan, will you marry me?"" he asked quietly as he got down to one knee. He started to look nervous when I didn't answer right away. But I was so caught up with my emotions I had trouble getting the words out. ""Yes."" I nodded. I leaned down and kissed him. His arms wrapped around me and he stood up before he spun us in a circle. He placed me gently on my feet. He reached up with both hands so he could untie the knot on the ribbons that held the ring. He took my left hand in his, raising it to his chest level, and, while keeping eye contact, he slid the ring on. He brought my hand to his lips and kissed it lightly. I rested my hand over his heart, and leaned in for heart-stopping kiss. The kind that always left me breathless with my heart pounding when we were done. ""The ring is beautiful. I love you so much and I will be happy to be your wife."" I rested my head against his chest while I caught my breath. I closed my eyes, already planning to show him how 'happy' in less than five minutes. ""The others are at a bar, we can go tell them our news,"" Edward suggested. ""Text them, or we can tell them tomorrow."" I bent down and picked up my bag. ""I've got a Christmas present for you that can't wait."" I waved the tiny bag. Edward eyed the swinging bag with curiosity. He reached for it, but I hid it behind my back. I grinned sly. ""Not yet, I'll be right back."" I kissed his cheek and disappeared into our bedroom. I changed into a sheer white baby doll that had been embroidered with mistletoe in all the right spots. I stepped out of the bedroom and waited in the doorway. He had his shirt off with his phone to his ear, so I waited for him to see me. ""I asked and she said…"" He looked up at that moment with a smile. His eyes widened once he spotted me. ""Fuck me."" He dropped his phone and strode over to me. I let out a laugh. ""Please tell me that was one of our friends, and not our parents, that you just said that my answer to your marriage proposal was 'fuck me'."" ""Huh?"" He looked over his shoulder to his abandoned phone. ""Shit. That was Jasper, he's not going to be happy with me."" He glanced back at me guiltily. His hands traced my body feeling every curve. ""You distracted me. You look gorgeous, love."" ""I'm glad you like it. You have to kiss under all this mistletoe. Feel up to it?"" I palmed his erection with my hand. He moaned as he twitched against my hand. ""Always."" He swung me up and carried me to the center of the room. I noticed he set up a pillow and blankets on the floor under the kissing ball. He laid me down first then removed his pants, tossing them to the side. He hovered over me, settling between my legs. ""Wait,"" I stopped him, he paused. I stretched to the side, to grab the hat off the floor that he had abandoned and placed it on his head. ""Perfect."" I gave him a silly grin. He shook his head in amusement, tickling my nose with mistletoe. I let out a small giggle. ""Are you ready, love? Because once I start, there's going to be no stopping me,"" he warned, his eyes darkened. ""I'm ready. Merry Christmas, Edward. I love you."" I placed my hand to his cheek and he kissed the palm of it. ""Merry Christmas, my love."" He kissed my lips lightly. He then moved on to explore his present. We made love multiple times that night, moving together as our entwined bodies became one. Nine months later—we had another blessing enter our lives.

My own outfit is quite simple in comparison to some of the others, but Alice assured me I look adorable, and spent an obscene amount of time positioning me just so to get the perfect picture to send to Edward. The entertainment guys introduce the first game of the evening: it's a naughty version of the balloon game. This results in about thirty people, among which there are several Santas and Christmas elves running around in varying stages of undress, humping each other in order to pop the balloon tied to their waist. The guys even include a demonstration of creative ways to do so. I never knew about the vertical sixty-nine until now. When there is finally one person left with an intact balloon, they are presented with a bottle of pink bubbly, which is immediately opened and passed around. The music is turned up again and people start dancing. The tinsel boys' interpretation of Sexy and I know it is particularly mesmerizing, with the G-strings wiggling to the beat atop one of the picnic tables. Next on the agenda is a limbo competition, again with a naughty twist: when a contestant falls they're eliminated, unless they remove an item of clothing. It doesn't take long until at least five guys are participating naked. ""I think they fell on purpose,"" Alice giggles next to me. ""You just keep an eye on Jazzo, he looks eager to join,"" I point out, and she rushes off to convince him that not everyone needs to see his dick. While the sight is pretty hilarious to witness, I don't stick around to see who ultimately wins the limbo competition. Instead, I take the opportunity to avoid queuing at both the toilets as well as the fridges. I refill my cup of goon and move to the table in the pool table room to add some raspberry cordial to it in order to improve the taste. I cannot resist dashing quickly to my bunk to check my phone. Still no text from Edward, although my parents have thoughtfully sent me a Merry Christmas message. I type out a response, including a picture of me and Alice in our costumes, then stuff my phone back under my pillow. When I make my way back across the only paved road at camp I'm startled by a tall figure in the shadows near the shop. Not reading too much into it, I slip around the reception building, heading back into the party area. All I want for Christmas is you has just started playing, and everyone is jumping around ecstatically. o.O.o When I'm refilling my cup I feel someone move to stand behind me. ""Did you know that you're standing underneath the mistletoe?"" Edward's soft, slightly gravelly voice rings out in my ear. Faster than I think possible I whirl around and come face to face with the boy I can't get out of my mind anymore. The boy who hasn't been answering my texts. ""Why didn't you answer my texts?"" I ask. ""I was on the road, hardly any service,"" he explains, and I know it to be true. ""Good surprise?"" There is no hesitation in my reply. ""The best."" ""Fuck, you're gorgeous,"" he whispers reverently. ""That costume really is… wow… there aren't any words,"" he continues, running a hand through his hair. I take a moment to appreciate the view of this enticing British lad in a pair of Santa boxers and a white singlet. But only for a minute, because he's looking too delicious to pass up. ""You're not so bad yourself,"" I counter. ""It was the only thing they had left,"" he explains apologetically, but I don't let him finish. ""You're here, that's all I care about."" Making it a point to look him over appraisingly, I continue, ""Besides, you're hot."" ""Damn, I missed you,"" he confesses. ""I missed you, too,"" I whisper, leaning up on my toes to finally kiss him again. He leans back, a playful smile on his lips, and holds something up over his head. When I look up I see that he actually brought with him some synthetic mistletoe. ""Our first Christmas kiss should be as traditional as can be,"" he explains. I am not one to complain, and happily reach up my hands to tangle in his hair as he closes the distance between our lips. o.O.o Glossary of Aussie words and surf expressions used Arvo Afternoon Backhand riding a wave with your back facing the wave, i.e. going left when your right foot is back (natural footed) or going right when your left foot is back (goofy footed) Cock-Up Screw Up Coffs Coffs Harbour, NSW Duck Diving getting through the white wash or larger broken waves by pushing your board underneath it Goon Boxed Wine, Usually of Poor Quality, but cheap hence a backpacker necessity G-String Thong (Underwear) Gloria Jean's Australian coffee house chain Kick out Exciting a wave by riding up and over the top Leash Cord Connecting the surf board to the surfer's leg Rashie Rash Guard Shirt Scorching/Scorcher very hot (""She's gonna be a scorcher"" = ""It'll be hot weather"") Set Group of waves suitable for surfing Sick/Epic/Gnarly Really good, Amazing Singlet Tank Top Stoked Excited Swimmers Trunks, Swim Shorts Take Off Catching a wave Thongs Flip-Flips Tim Tam Australian Chocolate Cookie Turtle/Eskimo Rolling getting through the white wash by rolling over with your board, allowing the wave to move over you – this is done when duck diving is not possible, usually with longer boards Ute Pick-Up Truck White Water Frothy, Broken waters White Wash Wipe Out Falling off your board Woopi Nickname for Woolgoolga, NSW Hosts Note: Please leave the author some love by submitting a review.

You have to remember I've got three children and not a lot of men want that responsibility. It's a lot for anyone to take on."" I roll my eyes at her. ""For some men, yes; however, I don't think this is the case for Edward. Edward loves kids and is able to see that if he wants to date you that the children are a part of the package. Trust me, I raised him and I know exactly what he can and cannot handle."" Bella hugs me and I hug her tight. I know she misses her parents, but I've always loved her like she was my own. Hopefully, someday soon I'll be her mother by marriage. Bella and I walk back into the family room and hand out the drinks. Before too much longer it's time to load up Bella's things and take the kids home. ""Drive safe and call me as soon as you get in,"" I say hugging Bella, the kids and then Edward. ~*Happy Human-Light Day*~ The next morning we're woken by the phone. We're shocked to learn that overnight we had a large snow fall. There's six to eight inches of heavy, wet snow outside. Dr. Gerandy's call was to inform Carlisle he was covering his shift and to stay home. Apparently, quite a few places around town are without power. ""Do think we should go out check on Bella and the kids?"" I ask after her home and cell go unanswered. ""Yeah, I think that would be a good idea. I've got the extra generator; we could hook it up for her, if she needs it."" Carlisle says. ""I'll go get dressed for the weather and load the generator into the back of the plow truck."" I smile at my husband, he loves that truck, and he only gets to use it a few months every year. I get dressed and make a bunch of sandwiches from the leftover ham. I send a text to Edward wanting to make sure he's okay, too. I load up the food and climb up into the large truck. The normal five minute drive to Bella's takes us half an hour. I get out the big truck and start to walk toward the door only to have Carlisle pull me behind a tree. ""Love, it's too cold for this,"" I say with a chuckle. He rolls his eyes at me and points across the driveway. I look and see Edward's car that clearly has been sitting there for more than a few hours. Then I hear the giggling of kids from the backyard. We make our way to the edge of the house and peer out back. I can't help but smile brightly as I see Edward chasing Bella around. I feel my heart swell as he picks her up swinging her around. They both tumble to the ground and she laughs before they share a chaste kiss. He rolls and gets up quickly and begins to chase the kids around. We watch for several minutes as they all play together and laugh. I notice that Edward is still in the same clothing he was wearing yesterday after he changed from church and I smile. Without alerting them to our being here, we unload the items we brought for them. After Carlisle puts the generator at the front door knowing Edward can hook it up we get back in the big truck. ""They look happy, like a family,"" I sigh. ""They really do, my love."" I nod as I wipe away a few tears of happiness that have fallen. ""We'll need to help her with Mary, you know. I will not allow her to stand in the way of our children and grandchildren having the happiness they deserve,"" I say harshly. ""I doubt Edward would let Mary interfere with what he's found,"" Carlisle chuckles. ""Even Bella knows Mary has no right to tell her what to do."" Before we pull away, I watch Bella trip and fall in the snow. Edward chuckles helping her up and they look at each other before he kisses her again. It's then I realize they're already in love. They may not see it yet, but it's as visible as the nose on my face. ""How soon do I have to wait to pray for a wedding and a new grandbaby?"" ""Well, since you'll want her pregnant by next Christmas, how about wait for the new year?"" An hour later, snuggled back home in front of the fire my cell phone dings with two incoming messages. I open the first text from Edward. ~Thank you for the generator, I'm hooking it up now. Oh, and I'll be spending New Years Eve with Bella, is that okay? She said you already planned to keep the kids that night. Love you, and thank you. This has been the best gift I've ever gotten, Edward.~ I don't reply yet, but I open the second text, which is from Bella. ~Thank you, so much. You were right, Edward was the best gift you could've ever given me and the kids. I love you both, Bella .~ I type out a quick reply to both of them and show Carlisle the texts. My smile gets brighter as he smiles, genuinely happy for our family. ""How about I give Momma Santa another present?"" he says wiggling his brows at me. ""Besides I still haven't seen you in that new nightie, you bought."" I chuckle and nod. ""You mean I may actually get it on before you ravage me this time? I love you, Papa Santa."" ""I love you, too, my sexy Momma Santa."" ""Happy Boxing Day, dear,"" Carlisle says as he carries me to our room. He's sure to stop under each of the sprigs of hanging mistletoe to kiss me along the way. ~*THE END*~"

But before she could respond, a voice called from over their heads, ""Esme!"" It seemed to be coming from the sky itself. Esme looked up, searching the unseen boundaries of the snow globe above them. ""Carlisle? Is that you?"" ""Esme! Please, answer me!"" ""It's time. You must make your final decision now,"" the angel stated with urgency. . . .0O0. . . Carlisle's panicked voice continued to call her name, but the angel had vanished, and once again, Esme was swallowed into infinite darkness, falling endlessly. She heard Edward's disembodied voice speak as well: ""That hunter must have ingested something, drugs maybe. It must have affected Esme's system."" ""I don't know how to fix her, Edward."" ""Her system will heal. You know that."" There was silence in the darkness before Edward spoke again. ""But knowing that isn't enough because…you still dread the worst. You would be changed without her."" Silence again. ""How long have you suspected, son?"" ""Your thoughts dwell on Esme quite often since she has arrived, but this is the first time I have truly understood of the depth of those thoughts."" ""I need you to understand –"" Edward replied without hesitation to the question forming in Carlisle's mind, ""I am happy for you. For us."" Esme could hear them more clearly with each passing second, but blackness still surrounded her. Her limbs felt – well, she couldn't feel them at all. The angel's final words came back to her: You must make your final decision now. So, would she fall endlessly until she decided? Would she die – cease to exist – if she didn't chose? She didn't know. But one thing she did understand from the angel's words: this would be the last time her guardian angel would intervene. This was her very last chance to pick the life she wanted to live. Would it be as a human in a loveless marriage and children from her own womb? Or…could she be strong enough to pick the life that offered love, a chance to make a difference, but yet would never be easy. Again, Carlisle came through. Her savior once again. ""Esme. Please ."" I chose you, Carlisle! she tried to call out. With no voice of her own, she began to pray. Please, Lord, never again will I take my life for granted. Please give me this one last chance. I promise I will not waste it. I promise to love myself and everyone around me. I will be the beacon of hope you created me to be. With a gasp and a jolt, Esme's eyes sprung open. Carlisle's angelic, concerned countenance was, once again, there to greet her. ""Oh, thank God!"" He heaved a sigh of relief and drew her into his arms. He had never held her before, but she did not object. He pulled her close to his chest, kissing the top of her head. She could see Edward standing at the foot of her bed; his head was bowed, but he was smiling like the cat that swallowed the canary. At first, Esme was disoriented, even nauseated – an unfamiliar sensation for a vampire. But she had just been falling through space, she reminded herself. No up, no down or sideways. No wonder she was queasy. Her heavy arms rose to embrace Carlisle and he anchored her. Esme smiled into Carlisle's knit-sweatered chest. Yes, he was her rock to this world, to this life she had chosen, and to this destiny. And tolove. ""Um, I think I'll just…go…anywhere but here,"" Edward said as he dismissed himself from the room as Carlisle and Esme's wordless hug lingered. Eventually, Carlisle eased Esme back onto the bed. He knelt on the floor next to her, taking her hands in his. She smiled widely. ""I saw my guardian angel, Carlisle. She was beautiful. And she told me so much. Taught me so much about myself and my life."" Carlisle looked into her eyes, but he didn't respond. Esme's face began to fall. Didn't he believe her? ""My snow globe! Where is it?"" She began to panic. ""It's right here. I put it on the shelf for safe keeping. I found you holding it when you were unconscious in bed."" He rose, retrieved it, and brought it over to Esme. ""It's magical, Carlisle!"" She took it from his hands and stared down at the town with its splendid Christmas tree. The snow stirred, drifting slightly against the miniature buildings. ""What did your angel share with you, Esme?"" She looked at Carlisle. His warm, golden eyes sparkled. ""She said…"" Esme bolted up. ""She told me…"" And suddenly she found herself scrambling to grab the fading, fleeting edges of a vision that was disappearing faster than she could chase it. ""I…I don't understand. I can't remember what she said. It was important though. And it was real!"" ""Of course it was,"" Carlisle replied, easing Esme back down into the lying position on her bed. ""Maybe you should rest."" Carlisle turned to leave, but as he began to shut the door to Esme's room, she called out after him, ""Wait!"" ""Yes?"" ""Carlisle, I never told you thank you. Thank you for this new life. I feel I have a renewed sense of purpose. I think…no, I know I belong here, with you and Edward."" Carlisle flashed the smile that made Esme's insides swim in warmth. ""I think so, too. And I hope our first Christmas together will be the first of many. It's not a simple life I have offered you, Esme, but I believe it can be a wonderful life.""

438,4,4,4-Mistletoe-Contest-4.txt,twilight,MistletoeContest,"cuter, softer version of Edward is hiding underneath his outside layer of being a dick just makes him better. Like caramel-filled chocolate. Or boozy punch. ""Okay,"" I sigh. He grins with relief, and then turns to look over his shoulder as our rescue party's echoing footsteps get nearer. ""Guess we'd better go."" Our rescue party turns out to be Jane, Mike, and Angela. Only one of them looks less than pleased to have found us. ""You locked yourselves in? You idiots,"" Jane grinds out, turning the key still left in the door with obvious resentment. ""Who told you to go down to the basement?"" I push Edward out of the way so I can escape first. ""Oh, thank god,"" I groan, stretching as if I've been trapped in a tiny mine. ""It was my fault,"" Edward says while I celebrate my freedom. ""We were going to get the trees."" Jane starts ranting, and he stands there and takes it, like a man. A hot, sexy man who laughs like a troll and kisses like a goddamn dream. Angela snaps her fingers in front of my face. I start, orienting my eyes to hers. ""What?"" ""You okay?"" ""Yeah, I'm fine."" She nods, looking us over. Her lips press into a tight line, as if holding back a smile. ""Uhm. His shirt's inside-out."" My eyes widen. Fuck. ""That's not… my fault,"" I lie. ""Okay."" ""We didn't… I mean, it's not… Okay, I'll just stop talking now."" ""Okay,"" she says again, turning away so she won't outright laugh in my face. When Jane's done tearing us a new one, she waits impatiently while we load the trees onto the cart. When we return to the store, she rounds on us. ""You two morons severely affected our time schedule. You have half an hour left to finish Dining, and for your own sakes, you better be done by then."" She turns, striding across the floor like she's the queen of Macy's. Chastised, we duck our heads and follow her. Jane takes a minute to point out everything we've done that she thinks is ugly before departing with a stern tapping at her wristwatch and a bone-chilling death-stare. ""So…"" Edward says, quickly unboxing the first tree. ""About that date."" ""Yeah?"" ""Wanna get breakfast? I know a great place that serves pancakes round the clock."" ""What, so we have our date now? Tonight?"" He shrugs. ""Yeah? Why, do you not want to? I'm just being practical."" ""How so?"" ""I'm hungry."" ""Very romantic."" ""We just made out in a basement that smells like mice poop. You really want to bring romance in to this?"" ""Fair point."" ""I mean, I can give you romance. Boy, can I give you romance. I'll romance the crap out of any situation. In fact,"" he says, brandishing a branch dramatically, ""I'm going to make eating pancakes so romantic, you'll probably die."" ""Oh, now I can't wait."" ""You'll see,"" he says, somewhat threateningly. Probably realizing this, he lowers the branch. ""I mean, you'll see."" ""Okay."" ""My point being, I'm a romantic guy, okay? So being with me has its benefits, beyond just the physical gratification."" He pauses, nodding to himself. ""Of which there will be lots."" ""Can't wait,"" I say, without the extreme sarcasm this time. I move closer, clutching a box of ornaments so I don't fondle him. ""No, seriously, I can't wait."" Smirking, he moves closer, too. ""So, it's a date?"" ""It's a date."" We smile at each other. It's pretty obnoxious. Over the course of the next 30 minutes, our co-workers show up to help us as they gradually finish their own sections. Jane actually looks disappointed that everything is set up as it's supposed to, and she mopes in her office after telling us we can leave. Edward helps me into my coat, brushing the side of my neck as he does. With a hand on my lower back – not pushing or guiding, but apparently just to be close – he walks us out of the locker room, not caring that everyone can see. When we get to his car, he doesn't so much open my door for me as he sprints ahead so he can gather up all the fast-food wrappers cluttering up the passenger seat. ""Sit, make yourself comfortable,"" he says, arms full, before hurrying off to the dumpster. I look around the car, not surprised to see three different tennis shoes, candy wrappers, and a beat-up old iPod in the backseat. When he comes back, his cheeks are tinged pink with excitement, and he's just smiling, like me being in his car is reason enough to. Leaning over, I kiss him. He looks surprised but pleased when I settle back into my seat. ""If this is an example of the romance you were talking about, you're off to a good start,"" I say. ""Really? Throwing away a moldy hamburger is your minimum requirement? That bodes well for me."" ""Well, I did let you kiss me in a basement. My requirements are all pretty minimum."" He grins, and reaches into his pocket. ""Speaking of which… I snagged this before we left."" He pulls out the mistletoe ornament, dangling it in front of me. He's replaced the gold string it used to have with a red ribbon, which he ties around his rearview mirror. We watch it spin slowly back and forth. The tacky silver glitter catches the light, twinkling gently at us. ""That is some ugly fucking mistletoe."" ""The actual worst."" ""Still,"" he says, ""without it, I wouldn't have kissed you. So I guess it's not all bad."" ""No,"" I say, leaning my head back as I smile at him. His own smile is both shy and pleased. ""Not bad at all, actually.""

439,4,9,4-Mistletoe-Contest-9.txt,twilight,MistletoeContest,"fall hard and fast as I cry and scream to myself in the confines of my rental car. The steering wheel takes the brunt of my anger at myself and the hate I feel for him. My heart pounds away in my chest, beating despite the knife he stabbed into it. And it wants what my head doesn't. They fight to reign over the other, both demanding to be heard and obeyed. I just don't know whom to follow. December 24th, 2014 The lights shine bright in the dark, like stars on a cloudless night sky. Even from a distance, I've seen them sparkling and dancing. Pulling into the driveway, I find that it's not only the windows Edward decorated, but the whole house. There's a wreath with an oversized red bow hanging on the front door, and the wooden Rudolph and Santa stand unmoving on either side of the stairs. The front door opens before I even have the chance to pull the car key. There's no yelling or running toward me though, he just stands there and watches me. It's only after working up the courage to actually get out of the car, that I realize he's holding a phone to his ear. ""Yeah, it's her. She's here."" The snow crunches noisily under my boots as I make my up to the house. Like a countdown that seems to get louder and louder the more you run out of time. He hangs up without another word as soon as I reach the last step. Even as we both walk inside, he remains silent, and it unnerves me. I've mentally prepared myself for all kinds of scenarios before making the drive back to the cabin, but the silent treatment wasn't one of them. Despite my inner tumult, I can't help but smile at the sight that greets me. Lights, figurines, candles and the lit tree, all out and situated in their rightful places. It's beautiful; just like I'd wanted it to be. I'm so mesmerized, I only notice Edward moving around as he sits down on the steps in front of me. ""I did okay?"" ""It's perfect."" He nods, wiping his hands over his thighs. I guess he exchanged his sweats and shirt from this morning for something warmer at some point, because he's dressed in jeans and a hoodie now. ""We need to talk."" ""We really do."" He holds his hand out for me to take, and though it's not an olive branch per se, I take it. ""First off, you forgot your phone on your way out."" He hands it to me as I sit down beside him. ""Alice called a few times and I eventually picked up. I was worried and thought she might have heard from you."" I sigh. ""Goodie."" ""Yeah, she is pretty angry, so you better call her back some time soon. They're all worried sick."" ""They?"" My heart drops. ""So much for my surprise."" ""Believe me, you surprised everybody all right. It was inevitable though, Alice was cursing up a storm and dad heard, so…"" ""It's fine. I'm not even sure anymore how the hell I could have ever thought this would work out."" ""It would have if it weren't for me, to say it in your own words. And it was good plan,"" he smiles, tapping my knee with his knuckle. ""Man, seeing their jaws drop would have been awesome. Anyway, mom is still over the moon that you're here. You'll probably get an earful for that stunt you pulled earlier, but you know she can't stay mad for too long. Just… don't do that shit ever again. Going through that twice was enough for me to last a lifetime."" ""I promise. And I need to apologize for— "" ""Accepted."" ""Edward."" ""No, it really is. I'm just glad to you're here and in one piece."" He takes my hand once more and squeezed it. ""And if it's about earlier, you have all the right in the world to be mad at me. I did some thinking, and you're right about everything you said. Fuck, I'm so mad at myself for having been such a bastard all along. It's no wonder you couldn't stand being around me anymore. Thinking that, by doing what I did you were forced to do what you did, really pisses me off."" ""Okay, but I want you to know that I thought long and hard about everything, too. And though, a part of me is still wounded and hurt by your actions, it's not fair to put all the blame on you. We've both been cowards, and we've both been idiots. We both made mistakes, Edward, and I want to apologize for mine."" ""Okay."" ""And I think that it's time to put the past to rest. I doubt it will work overnight, but we've wasted four years and it's enough. I can't do it anymore, I need to be around my family and friends I need to be around the people I love."" ""As we need you."" Flashing me a bright smile, he leans back on the stairs. I follow suit, and though it's not the most comfortable position, we remain like that for a while. Holding hands and gazing at the ceiling, while lost to our own thoughts. ""How do you feel about cookies and a hot chocolate?"" I decide to break the silence once my butt starts to hurt. ""I feel like that's exactly what I need after a day like this. C'mon."" He pulls me onto my feet and into his arms. ""I know we still have a long way to go, but I'm really happy to have you back."" ""I'm glad to have you back, too. I missed my… friend."" Hosts Note: Please leave the author some love by submitting a review.
